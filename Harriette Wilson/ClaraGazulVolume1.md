CONTAINING SOME ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR.

THOUGH my Memoirs have long been before the public, I have not yet explained how and why I became the mistress of Lord Craven, at the early age of fifteen, and the public is still ignorant whether it was love, the severity of my father, or the depravity of my own heart which placed me in that unfortunate situation ...

I am now disposed to gratify curiosity, provided the reader has the grace to attend to "a plain unvarnished," statement of facts which I will make as short as possible; and I offer this explanation in extenuation of my offences against the good order of society.

My father was a native of Vevey, and you all know or ought to know, that Vevey is a small town situated on the borders of the Lake of Geneva, in the Canton de Vaud, which once formed part of the Canton de Berne, until it was separated in 1798, by the rebellion which broke out in Switzerland at that period.

My father's native place has always been celebrated by travellers as presenting scenery of incomparable beauty. Vevey is not very distant from Clarens - that spot which J. Jaques Rousseau has immortalized.

My paternal ancestors in old times were nobles, and distinguished themselves in the politics of Europe. I could furnish my readers with an account of the former feats, armorial bearings, &c. of the late Barons Du Bochet, but that I should be afraid of sending them to sleep, and therefore, I briefly proceed to inform them that my grandfather was the worst tempered man in all the Canton and my father, John Du Bochet, at the age

of thirteen left his parents roof in search of adventures, never to return. His two Brothers soon followed his example, and were not afterwards heard of.

My father joined a recruiting party journeying towards Holland, who refused to take him into their service on account of his extreme youth. Charmed, however, with the beauty of his countenance, and his inteligent discourse, they supported [him] on his journey, and suffered him to partake of their meals.

Arrived in Holland his fine face and talents caused him, to be remarked and admired by all who beheld him, and he had scarcely passed a month in that country, when the colonel of a Swiss Regiment, being accidentally in his society, attached himself to his interest at once, and engaged him as military secretary.

My father continued in this colonel's service for some time, when oh! Love, fatal, all powerful love! What misery, what crimes, do you some times occasion.

The Colonel had a Mistress, that Mistress was but frail, my father was the loveliest youth in Christendom, and as ardent, as lovely, so there was no such thing as resisting him; and the Colonel surprized his interesting, and young but most inteligent protege in the arms of his mistress. A meeting was the result. My father excelled in the use of arms, the Colonel fell, and the secretary's life, by the laws of that country, was forfeited. Can we wonder if he desired to make an abrupt retreat? This alas, was interupted by the guards!

It is in the course of nature that we defend our own lives; my father fired, and the guard fell dead at his feet.....

His mind, as I have heard, was deeply affected by this two-fold misfortune, and he wandered half over the known world; from Italy to Spain, then to America, then to Lisbon; and it was by his talents, grace and high courage, that he continued to make his way everywhere.

At length he obtained a sufficient sum of money to

### Page v

embark with merchandise for England, on a speculation. The ship in which he sailed was lost in sight of Lisbon, but my father saved his life by his expertness in swimming, and found himself once more pennyless on the shores of Portugal. In a few hours afterwards he announced himself to the principal inhabitants of the capital, as professor of algebra, mathematics, German, French, dancing and fencing, and soon obtained scholars in all these branches of education, saved money, and embarked once more for England.

Here he made the acquaintance of General Burgoyne, who afterwards engaged him as private secretary. My father accompanied him to America, where, although attached to his staff, he had the good fortune to escape the disgrace of that General, when with the whole British army, he was made prisoner by the Americans. My father being despatched on some important mission at some distance from the scene of action.

I remember he used to bless his lucky stars, while recounting to us, that at the very moment of the action he happened to be quietly and innocently enjoying himself over a bottle of Burgundy with a friend in total ignorance of what was going on.

From thence he started again for England, where he arrived and fell desperately in love with my mother, and he had the talent to prevail on the most modest timid girl that could well be imagined, to consent, at fourteen years of age, to a private marriage.

The tameness of a married life, however, but ill suited my father's ardent spirit, and it was impossible for two minds or dispositions to be more widely different, or more unlikely to agree than my parents.

I was their sixth daughter, and born on a Friday the 2d of February, 1786, at No. 23, Queen Street, May Fair.

Early impressions are lasting. My father made a

### Page vi

strong impression upon me by dint of birch, when I was about five years old, but I deserved it all, having torn up a problem of his to make myself a fly-trap, and Papa undertook to use the birch until I should promise never to sin again.

I remember feeling indignant at the first sight of the rod, and screwing my courage up to the coming emergency, I fixed my eyes with firmness on my father's face.

"Promise not to do it again," said Papa between each heavy lash of the rod. 

"Say no," cried my poor mother, "only say no, child - it is easy to say no, surely" - but my mind was made up, that nothing, not even a negative should be extorted from me by dint of blows.

"This devil must be got out of the child, " said my father; I was thrown on the bed and whipped, till my body was disfigured from head to foot; yet I believe my father acted from principle, for he was not habitually cruel to children, but such unusual obstinacy in so young a child, required, as he no doubt conceived, extraordinary correction. If he gave me my way this time, there would be an end to all discipline for ever. However, I did not cry out once, but let him beat me till I was fainting. Atlast, the feelings of nature, added to my mother's tears, induced him to give up the case as hopeless. Indeed, it was so, for I feel well assured I should have died of blows at any period of my life, rather than anything should have been beat out of me by force.

I was, nevertheless, a very affectionate child, and have often, even at that very early age laid awake and wept, while my mother thought I slept, because I saw the trace of tears on her cheeks.

With regard to the above-mentioned sound and desperate flogging, it is incredible even to myself how clearly I recollect every circumstance attending it; namely, that the dispute began in the back parlour, that

### Page vii

I was by my father carried from thence to his bed-room on the second floor, and placed on his bed to be whipped. I remember even the thoughts and feelings which determined me to die, rather than they should beat anything out of me. It was not anger or rage, for young as I was, I felt and knew that this punishment was not inflicted with malice, but a mixture of sensations for which I had no name, although their united influence was felt. I fancied there could be no merit of me promising any thing out of fear; and my mind being firmly made up at the beginning of the chapter, this severe punishment which after my skin was broken became painful in the extreme, never made me waver a single instant, so as to afford my father the slightest hopes or chance of victory.

The day was my own!! My father resigned the birch, absolutely fatigued with exercise, and my poor body was rubbed with what was considered most healing, yet I continued more than a fortnight, stiff, feverish, and full of pain.

My eldest, sister whose education had been particularly attended to, undertook the arduous task of teaching me to read. I was the greatest dunce in the world, and at an age when she had been an excellent reader of a newspaper aloud, I scarcely knew my alphabet.

My sister, whom we will call Diana, used to shake me, and call me a tiresome, absent little brat. As well might she have talked to the wind. My ideas always wandered from the book, to the blue bottles and wasps flying about the room, and as to learning any thing by heart that was not entertaining, it seemed to me to be utterly beyond all possibility.

At last a lady happened to read something aloud in my presence that delighted me, I asked for the book, wanted to read the passage myself, and implored sister Diana's instructions. Reading was no longer dry: I learn't it easily and at once, just as my sister had given me over for a dunce. As soon as I could read, I be-

### Page viii

gan teazing every body for books, I could not endure story books about naughty boys and girls, &c. but there was an old book in our nursery, called the Speaker, containing scraps of Shakspeare, and other great authors, which delighted me, especially Cardinal Wolsey's speech, not that I understood it, but I had a sort of guess that I should do so one day or other. In the meantime I read it over and over again, and asked Diana the meaning ofevery line. My sister Paragon was my constant companion and play-fellow; she was two years my senior.

The habit of reflection came upon me very young, and long before I could read, I used to sit on my little stool apart from the rest to puzzle my head about the nature and attributes of God. Why we are often ill and unhappy? What was heaven? What was death? When was the world to be at an end, &c. My sister Paragon must still recollect how often I used to consult and plague her about the end of the world, before I had attained my fifth year.

Paragon was so proud of being my elder sister, that she could not endure to appear ignorant on any subject; so she answered my question one day in these words, delivered with just as dignified an air, as that with which she now holds forth on the virtues of Doctor Anderson's Scots pills.

"Child," said Paragon, "this world will be at an end when all the little children shall be grown up to men and women."

"Oh! very well," said I delighted to come at a reasonable conclusion, and I put my head on my hand while I reflected, in order to study the probablity of the case.

"It is all wrong," said I to Paragon, after ten minutes deep cogitation.

"What is all wrong?" Paragon asked.

"Why because when I am only half grown up, the big girls and boys will be men and women, and more little ones will come, whilst I am getting to my full size."

### Page ix

"Oh never mind that puzzling stuff," said Paragon carelessly, while tying on her doll's new bonnet.

"I wish I could speak to God Almighty about it," I exclaimed very seriously.

"Oh! For shame, Miss," said our nurse, "it is very wicked to talk about the Almighty in this sort of way,"

"Well, but if I am never to see God, or to talk about him, how am I to love him; why, I shall forget all about him."

"Fye! Fye! Miss, you must pray to God, and not chatter about him in that sort of manner."

"But then I don't know what prayers mean."

"Mean child? You pray that God may make you a good girl."

"Yes! But then I want to know if he hears me."

"He hears every word you say, and knows all your thoughts."

"How are you sure of that?”

"It so written in the Bible - Don't ask so many questions child, you are too young: - You must be a good girl, love God and then you will go to heaven."

"Is heaven a nice place," I enquired, and continued earnestly to question the old woman, until she refused to answer me.

I was sent to shool for a short time, where I lern't nothing; and my mother, before I was eight years of age, discovered that I could only learn what struck my fancy, and nothing that any person might wish to drive into my head; I, therefore, returned home, quite as ignorant as I had left it, to her talk of nothing but my sister's conquest, the kiss that Tom Sheridan had given Fanny, the appointment Paragon had made to walk with Ned Jess, &c. 

Then Fanny would read to us for the hundred and fiftieth time, her cousin's warm effusion, the first and only love letter she had ever received. "Dear me," said I one night to her, "how very tiresome all this love and nonsence is," just as Fanny,

### Page x

after undressing and cold-creeming her nose for the freckles, had placed herself in our old fashioned ponderous arm chair to read us her love letter once more; the contents of which, I shall never be able to forget - beginning thus:

> The lover that but seldom requires the making of
> apologies, is too frequently confounded in the at-
> tempt , whilst the gay and violatile, with hearts as light
> as their heads, pass over these matters, with complete
> indifference, and escape with impunity. I should be
> happy to escape your censure, for daring to violate
> my engagement for our walk in the Green Park, but
> would fain convince you that the emergency of the
> case, &c. &c.

My readers like myself, have had quite enough of Fanny's cousin's love letter; but my sisters Paragon, Diana, and Amy, were never satiated.

We slept in two apjoining rooms, and I, who was always in bed first, could get no rest for their abomniable chattering " Read your letter to us," said Paragon to Fanny, " and don't attend to that tiresome little plague Harriette, who will never get married as long as she lives.

To be brief, my sister might have set me a good example, and it is just possible I might have followed it; but the fact is, no poor girl could well be thrown into worse hands. Morning, noon, and night I heard of nothing but softness of Tom Sheridan's hand, the brightness of Berkelay Craven's eyes, &c. &c. and my elder sister must recollect how disgusted I used to be with their conversations, in return for which they called me" tell-tale, and brown, ugly, straight-haired figure of fun." In short, I was considered a spy amongst them, and only because I could not enter into their feelings, or desire to be followed and made love to in the streets; indeed, I never dream't of being liked, either abroad or

### Page xi

at home. Naturally shy, my sisters had succeeded in making me believe myself both ugly and every way uninteresting, but I was no tell-tale, although I did once threaten to acquaint my mother, with their sly meetings with gentlemen, and what was still worse I contrived to steal Fanny's worn out love effusion, and slip it into our [meat] pye just befere it was carried to the baker, in order that I might be relieved from the intolerable bore of listening to its perusal.

Now, I will ask my readers whether it be possible for a child to listen for months and years together, to a set of gay young girls, for ever raving on their love, their lovers, and their sensations, without having her curiosity a little bit excited? At length, I began to look slyly under my bonnet at these lovers they all made such a fuss about, and as soon as I took the trouble to curl my hair, I was beset with a host of admirers, who sent me messages, and pretty copies of verses by our maid servant, for I appeared much older than I really was.

However, I never went out alone, or encouraged any man to address me, but my mother, who used to accompany me in my walks, having observed the admiration I excited in the street, advised my father to take me to France, and place me in some school or convent out of harm's way.

Let my readers then suppose me equipped in my new little travelling dress, all impatience, and trembling with anxiety to see the world, kissing my mother and sisters by turns, and taking a last look at the crows I had been so long in the habit of watching and feeding from the leads at the top of our house.

At length I was seated with Papa in the Brighton coach. The trees seemed to dance on merrily before me, and for the first half hour I could not believe they kept their station. I was, however, disappointed in the pleasure I expected to derive from a first view of the country: sanguine people, like myself , are often disappointed, and Sussex is so flat and ugly. The sea struck

### Page xii

me with wonder and astonishment. "What a pity we are not going to India instead of Dieppe," said I to my father because I wanted to see with my own eyes how far the sea would go.

Two gentlemen sailed with us, one of them was called Allen; his companion, an aristocratical looking young stripling, was handsome, graceful and particularly elegant in his attire. We had a tedious passage of three days and three nights. My poor father, always suffered at sea, and could not bear the smell of a cabin, so he remained all the first night on deck. I was still more affected than my father, and remained in bed. The youth, Mr. Allen's friend, passed the whole night by my side, and paid me every kind of civility, handing me tea and various refreshing scents from his magnificent dressing case.

At last, an old lady thought it incumbent on her to send a message to my father, advising him to interrupt the close and pointed attention of the young gentleman to his daughter. After this hint, my father never once lost sight of me for the rest of the passage. He would have scolded me, but he found me too ill either to resist or encourage the addresses of any man.

The youth now laboured to convince me by slight, almost imperceptible signs, that he had not forgottenme. My father was annoyed, and a sort of talking at each other conversation took place, in which my father had much the best of it.

Dieppe, as we approached it, struck me as the most picturesque place imaginable. The women's caps three stories high, and so curiously adorned, and their immense long ear rings and pretty faces, delighted me.

I was interrupted in my admiration by a custom house officer, who came to inquire my name. The handsome youth stood close behind us. "The misfortune of it is Sir," said he to my father, who had thrown out many severe hints, about the emptiness of the youths of the day, &c . "that we are obliged here to tell our secrets whether we like it or not."

### Page xiii

"My daughter is not ashamed of her name or of her age, " said my father, glancing contemptuously on the youth, and speaking as usual with a slight foreign accent. "I might be ashamed of mine," added he, "for I am growing old, but that I see youth so impertinent and ridiculous."

The young gentleman reddened, and seemed about to answer in anger, but his friend eagerly made signs to him to be silent, and he obeyed. There was good taste in his forbearance towards an offended father, and I began to consider the young gentleman with some degree of interest.

Since we were about to be separated, I wished much to have been permitted to bid him adieu! I hate parting with any body, when I believe the separation is to last for ever. I would have looked mygood wishes at some safe opportunity, but that I loved my father, and conceived he had been treated with disrespect.

Under this impression, I took care that our eyes should not meet, although, when unobserved, I examined the young gentleman's countenance. I thought I read something of contrition there, and guessed that his friend had read him a lecture on the bad taste he had been guilty of. He was high bred and thoughtless, but not, I think, unfeeling. They had a handsome travelling equipage on board, and appeared to be men of fortune.

We went to an hotel kept by Monsieur de la Rue, and retired immediately to bed, being both worn out with fatigue. Early the next morning, my father accompanied me in a long walk. I was charmed with every thing I saw. We did not return till my legs would carry me no farther.

As I stood at the window of our sitting room which faced the court, I saw an elegant English chariot, and four post horses, preparing for some traveller's departure. Soon afterwarns we observed Mr. Allen's graceful young friend, wrapped up in a pelisse, addressing an

### Page xiv

English servant. He raised his eyes towards our window, but appeared timid, and half afraid to acknowledge us, lest his bow should not be returned. When we had breakfasted, we again went out in search of the bureau de la Malle-Poste, and as we left the hotel, Mr. Allen stept into the carriage. His young friend was about to follow him when we passed. He blushed - hesitated - pursued us a few steps - then returned towards the carriage, and again followed us with an appearance of more resolution. His present timid agitation interested us the more, by its contrast with his former boldness; even my father was softened.

"I could not leave Dieppe, Sir," said the young gentleman, respectfully taking off his hat - "I really Sir, could not make up my mind to lose sight of you and your daughter, perhaps for ever, without offering my best and most sincere wishes for the happiness of you both." My father looked undetermined, and the young gentleman's confusion increased. As I watched his countenance, and his earnest natural manner I began to hope that he had taken a sort of liking to my parent, and for this, I could have thanked him on my knees, so dearly did I love my father.

"I am a very wild profligate fellow," said the young man at last, his colour heightening as he went on. "I am not good for much Sir, but upon my word and honour I mean right now, and if you will do me the honour to shake hands with me, I shall travel with a lighter heart."

"Sir," said my father, shaking him cordially by the hand, " I wish you a pleasant journey to Italy." My father's smile, contrasted with his usual severity of expression, produced a wonderful effect, it was so perfectly beautiful, independent of the glimpse it afforded of his brilliant teeth. "I was quite wrong Sir, and enough to disgust you of young men in general, but you must not refuse to acknowledge me, should we hereafter meet; I shall

### Page xv

mend, Sir, and grow amiable after my travels. "The last words were uttered with such boyish archness, as a child is apt to use when coaxing a parent; then bowing low and gracefully to me, he added with something like emotion, and as if from his heart," God bless you Mademoiselle, I wish you both every possible happiness."

In another instant he had sprung into his carriage, and was out of sight. There is something, I repeat, in an eternal farewell, which always affects me deeply. I was not at all in love with this youth, but he had just stood before me, and was gone for ever. His eyes had met mine for an instant, and I remembered their expression, was benevolent and tender, and the tone of his voice was softened.

He, too, disliked parting with the face that had pleased him; he, too had felt that chill, cold, tremulous sensation, which at the same instant had weighed upon my heart, whilst turning his back upon us for ever! My father too, would soon leave me in a foreign county to the care of strangers whom I had never beheld and might not like. My heart was suddenly oppressed, I drew my large bonnet over my eyes to conceal a tear I could not suppress, and to this hour, I remember that parting with a feeling of melancholy.

We proceeded to Rouen on the same evening that we took leave of the stranger. My father having agreed with the Abbess of the celebrated convent of St. Ursulines, I took an affectionate leave of him, and was presented by the Abbess to all her boarders, nearly a hundred in number. I felt very melancholy among so many strange faces, and my school-fellows countenances did not please me, with the exception of La petite Comtesse de Richmond, who was very lovely indeed. We were soon sworn friends, which friendship lasted with warmth, as long as I remained in Rouen.

I will not, at present, take up the reader's time, with the convent, or its anecdotes, nor will I dwell on such matters as Julia's romantic passion for our confessor,

### Page xvi

Le Pere Petersin, who laboured so vainly to make me a catholic - Mademoiselle Moreau's black beard - The candle snuffer's crooked nose - The kindness of the Demoiselles Lambert's, nieces to the Archbishop of Rouen, who procured me invitations to dine with their Right Reverend Uncle, every Thursday, (our holiday). Nor will I enumerate how many times I was selected by our Abbess for the high favor of pressing my ruby lips on his right reverend great toe, there to hold them fast, and inhale French cirage, while we received his blessing, "Bene, Bene, sancto spiritu," but I have forgotten my Latin.

I was too ingnorant even for the third and lowest class in our convent, so I was an outcast, and I used to amuse myself with drawing horses and cows on my slate, while the young ladies wrote down their lessons from the lips of their masters, in the shape of dictation. The Abbess was a noble lady of high birth, and as I was the first English girl she had ever under her protection, she made me her pet, "sa folie," and I shall never forget her tenderness, or cease to regret the advantage I took of it , and the tricks I used to play her. However, they were all good natured tricks, and when she shook her head at me, or held up her finger, I used to hug her and half smother her with kisses; and then in her very pretty voice she would read me a lecture, invite me to dinner, and give me pralines, jelly, eau de Cologne, and eau benite - She was a beautiful woman of her age, which might be fifty, or less, and her fair countenance, was most truly soft and benevolent. I always told her she was beautiful, but she really did not seem to know what beauty meant; a woman so accomplished, yet so pure and completely innocent, I should have believed was not inhuman nature, butfor my acquaintance with Madame Cousin, which was the name the lady Abbess bore.

Her brother, the handsome confessor, used to expound the Bible, and explain the catholic religion: this was not at all dry to me, but a matter of deep interest.

### Page xvii

"Hors de la religion catholique point de salue*" said the good priest, and I had no idea of being cut out of my "salue,” in his sort of way.

After all my vain puzzling at home, I was delighted to find a patient, willing, handsome priest, who was never tired of reasoning with me on the very subject which had been tormenting me ever since I was four years of age.

The priest did not like me to make him laugh on serious subjects, au reste, he gave me carte blanche to state all my objections straight forward as they occurred to me, in doing which, I sometimes placed his creed in a ludicrous light, without really meaning it, because I naturally seize upon the ludicrous points of any subject with great quickness - 'tis my forte or calling.

This our priest pitied and forgave whenever his own gravity of countenance was not disturbed by it, but he was no dense stupid bigot, and wit amused him malgre lui.

"You have the talent to make me laugh," said he, "but I forbid you to exert that talent when we discourse on matter of religion."

"Et moimon cher Peret je vous defends.† At least I must request that you do not place St. Peter before my mind's eye in such a ludicrous light, or St. Paul either."

"You go too far."

"Eh bien! Voulez vous me pardonner mon Père?‡"

"Je ne sais pas!"

"I don't know."

"But I'll never laugh again as long as I live, I tell you. I have been mistaken Father, for I had thought that the good and true religion was merry and gay , and far from disregarding these two gentlemen, I esteem them greatly, and should do more so, if you could only assure me that they were less dirty fellows than the poor Jews of this present day."

"Mais je ne rirai plus de ma vie je vous dis - c'st que je me suis trompee voyez vous mon cher Pere car j'ai cru que la bonne et veritable religion fut gaie, et bien loin de mepriser ces deux messiers la, je les estime fortement et surtout si vous pouvez m'assurer qu'ils etoient un peu moins sales que les pauvres juifs d' aujourdhui."

"Vous etes mechante," said the priest, who had taken me into his beautiful little library, adorned with fine paintings and scarlet and damask draperies.

"Maman, ma petite maman viens donc vite? Viens ici, vite! vite!" I exclaimed, calling out to the Abbess who sat reading in the adjoining room, which was her study, "Pourquoi Maman m'as tu enfermee avec ce beau pretre qui deja s'oublie et chmmence a me dire ces sottisses?[1]"

La petite Maman, as we all called the lady Abbess hastened to join us with a face of alarm.

"Voila qui est trop farce.[2]" said the priest, laughing outright.

"Suis-je mechante donc?[3]" I asked.

"Du moins vous avez bonne physionomie,[4]" he replied, still laughing.

"Embrasse moi donc mon Pere[5]," said I.

"Savez vous que ce sera pour la premiere fois.[6]” observed the handsome priest, half inclined to blush, as he

pressed his virgin lips on my cheek, now that this harmless liberty was sanctioned by the presence of his sister. The lady Abbess was kind enough to exert herself in vain, to prepare me for one of the classes by private lessons, but I was too " distrait," and could not help it. All I did in the convent was to reflect much, study music a little, and religion a good deal -and then I learnt the rule of three, in the hopes of giving my poor father an agreeable surprise and verbs "avoire" and "être," for which I received a shilling, and our daily little prayer, for which I received nothing.

"Je vous salue, Marie pleine de grace ! Le seigneur est avec vous et Jesus le fruit de vos entrailles est benit! Sanite Marie! Mere de Dieu! Priez pour" nous pauvres pecheurs maintenant et a l'heure de "notre mort[1]."

En voila assez du convent![2]

After two years residence, during all which time I stoutly resited and adjured the holy Roman Catholic religion, I returned to a very uncomfortable home.

My sisters Amy and Fanny had both ran off; - One with Mr. Trench, the other with Mr. Woodcock. Paragon and Diana lived still in all their purity, but they were both very cross to me, which I felt the more from having been made so much of in Rouen, not only by the Abbess and her brother, who both shed tears on taking leave of me, but also by many of the parents and connections of my school-fellows, who had been kind enough to invite me to their houses.

I entreated my dear mother to look out for some

situation for me, and she procured me that of music mistress, or rather, to superintend the young ladies studies in music, at a certain elegant boarding sehcol near Bayswater.

I only wish I could recollect the school mistress's name for I have good and sufficient reason to complain of her very illiberal and unfeeling conduct towards me. She was at that time rather a pretty delicate woman, and always wore white as did her scholars. Mine was a fatiguing duty, for I was required to my chair, by the side of a pianoforte, in the music room, from nine till three every day, while the whole school in turn, practised their dull lessons out of tune and out
of time.

Though my head was often severely affected by this eternal unharmonious jingling in my ears, I endure it without a single complaint, and I defy them to point out any poor devil of a music mistress, who was ever more steady to her post, or attentive to her pupils. The Englishs teacher was a little fat brandy-faced vulgar looking woman, to whom the young ladies never shewed the slightest respect. To make amends, they were all frightened to death at the least sound of the little black French teacher's voice, who ruled them with a rod of iron. I, who had lived long enough in France, among French ladies to be a tolerable judge of French manners, could not for the life of me help expressing my surprise one day to the English teacher, that the mistress should have placed a woman of the very lowest order, about young ladies of fashion.

The English woman thought I had misjudged the French teacher, but no one could have been mistaken in her, who like myself, had lived in good high bred French society. How this woman had picked up a little French grammer, I cannot guess, for her habits and expressions were the lowest and most common that can well be imagined. Policy is not my forte, I hate it, so it was easy for the French woman to read my heart,

### Page xxi

and preceive that I appreciated her a sa juste valeur,[1] and held her in notable contempt, therefore she hated me with her whole heart and soul, and easily contrived to render me perfectly wretched.

One night, when I had been at this academy about three months, a young lady who slept in the bed next to mine, was taken ill, and the French teacher entered our room just as I had stepped out of bed en chemise, to offer my assistance. My full bosom was completely uncovered. The French woman fixed her penetrating eyes on it, with the severe scrutiny of a judge on the bench. I hastened to cover it in much confusion.

"Don't cover your bosom." said the fury in French, "pray don't cover it, I have long been curious to see your bosom, in order to ascertain what I strongly suspected: that is not the bosom of virgin, *vous êtes fille*," said she, laying the deepest stress on the world *fille*, and screaming with revengeful passion - "vous êtes une fille qui a bien fait ses farces en France; je parierai ma tete que vous êtes une fille!! Et j'en dirai autant à madame."

The deep wound this wretch inflicted, the shame, indignation, and bitterness of feeling, she on that occasion excited in me, no time can erase from mymemory. I was, God knows, innocent in thought and word, and my heart as pure, as was person from the touch of man; yet, there I stood accused and condemned in the presence of the whole school, by the lowest order of French reptiles, on no other ground than the fulness of my bosom, which was the more remarkable, because of my very slender waist.

To any plausible thought false accusation I had promptly, and perhaps, wittily replied, but I had enough of the dignity of woman about me, to offer no refutation here. I remained perfectly silent, trembling all over, with my heart beating and my cheek glowing, while my

mouth became parched and feverish from the violence of my agitation. One of the young ladies, in pity, handed me a glass of water. I passed a wretched night after the French fury had left me, which was not till she had made herself hoarser than usual by every insulting expression, and by which she vainly expected to provoke me to reply. Early in the morning I requested an interview with the fine lady of the house.

"I have been cruelly insulted," said I to her in a slow trembling voice. She interrupted me to say she knew all; that her French teacher was an accomplished woman, and she was persuaded had not said any thing worse of me than I richly deserved.

Bursting with pride and anger, I flew up stairs to my room, where having hastily put my clothes in my trunk I descended into the road by a back entrance from the garden, and returned to my parents to be harshly treated by my father, to whom I could not find courage to explain my reasons for running away from the school where my mother had placed me, and I merely assigned as a reason that I found it impossible to aggree with the French teacher.

Ah! Dear, kind, gentle Abbess of St. Ursuline! Little did you dream that your poor little favorite, who had slept in your arms, listened to your pure innocent conversation and been loved by you as your own child, would soon be insulted and suspected of such degradation of vice as we neither of us rightly understand, and mistaken for one belonging to a race of wretched outcasts whom we had scarcely even once encountered in the course of our lives.

Though deeply wounded, I was not disheartened, and hoping to be more fortunate for the time to come, I determined to seek out for another situation. I had, indeed, no choice, for my father assured me drily and harshly, that being nearly fourteen years of age, I must earn my livelihood, instead of eating the bread of my

### Page xxiii

young brothers and sisters. Heaven knows, I ate but little of their bread, being subject to violent head aches, faintness, and pains in the side.

Dear sisters in affliction! Ye set of mahogany coloured governesses and teachers in seminaries, martyrs to the rising generation, whose ideas must be taught to shoot amongst us though we die of it, from my heart I pity you, particularly if you have exercised your functions in the north of England, and happen to be *tantsoit peu poitrinaire*.[*]

A lady, in Bedford Square, who had received a commission from Miss Ketridge of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, to engage a teacher and music mistress under one, for her pupils at Ketridge House, was pleased to express herself "prepossessed with my appearance," so I was hired. I felt my spirits sink very low on taking leave of my dear mother, to go to this freezing atmosphere. Cold weather disagreed with me. I was in low miserable health, and I shuddered at the recollection of the unmerited insults I had received from the French teacher at Bayswater.

However, as there was no remedy, I armed myself with courage, and determined to do my best. I travelled two nights in the mail with the late Tom Sheridan, who was on his road, I think, to join Lord Moira in Edinburgh.

He was very attentive and respectful, and begged me to allow him to correspond with me. I told him if I had not wished to act rightly, I should not have gone to
Newcastle, as I found no lack of admirers in London, who wished to get me under their protection.

"But I want to write you a brotherly letter, and give you good advice," said Tom Sheridan. "Well, write to me once at all events," I replied, adding with my usual comical sort of frankness; "I do want a love letter so very bad to send to Fanny, and read to her over

### Page xxiv

"and over again, to pay her for tiring me so with her cousin's effusion, till I was forced to put it into the meat pye." Tom Sheridan laughed violently, and asked me if I had never yet received a love letter.

"Oh yes, a good many," said I, "only they were from quite strangers, and I never opened them but returned them untouched."

"By way of shewing yourself over virtuous," asked Tom Sheridan.

"No, but I am proud. My school fellows, in the convent, would have felt deeply insulted, if strangers would have addressed love letters to them slyly, and however unfortunate may be my situation, my school fellows loved me as their friend and sister, and I at least may emulate them."

"Well, but I am no stranger," said Tom Sheridan, and he promised to write me such a letter, as would not offend my pride.

It was midnight when I arrived at this northern academy for young ladies, the freezing tall bonny mistress of which, was a maiden lady, for any thing I know to the contrary, aged fifty, and she called herself Miss Ketridge. It was on a Saturday night, and I was ushered, by a bare-footed nymph through a wet kitchen, which was being mopped clean for the following Sunday, into a large dismal parlour, where I was not welcomed the least in the world, but formally desired to take a seat at the supper table.

This being the very first time I had travelled by night in a public coach, I was completely overcome with fatigue, and unable to partake either of Miss Ketridge's
small beer, which was very small indeed, or of her uninteresting little Dutch cheese. A fat smiling young lady in a Scotch plad dress, sat on the left ofmine hos-
tess, stitching away at anew shirt. Miss Ketridge presented her to me as Miss Macdougal, the English teacher, and desired her to put bye her work and eat her supper, and then accompany me to my bed room.

### Page xxv

"You will not be sorry to retire Miss Du Bochet," was one of Miss Ketridge's hospitable remarks, drawing up her long throat which was uncovered, and screwing up her lips which were like two bits of dry leather. "I will point out to you, Miss Du Bochet , " continued
the lady , "your various duties to-morrow morning when you will be refreshed."

I bowed, or rather nodded; "for it was all nodding - nid, nid, noddy, noddy," with me ever since I had been seated.

Miss Macdougal's unsavoury meal was soon dispatched, when she arose, and with a smile, proposed to accompany me to my apartment. In less than ten minutes, I was in a profound sleep, after having humbly intreated not to be disturbed too early in the morning; because two nights and days, in such excessive cold, had quite worn me out.

Nevertheless, precisely at six the next morning, Miss Macdougal, in her green plad, stood at the foot of my bed, desiring me to lose no time, as she had trespassed on Miss Ketridge's commands, in order to afford me the indulgence I had begged for.

"If six o'clock is an indulgence at Christmas, after two nights in the mail, pray Miss Macdougal, what is your usual hour of rising?" said I , rubbing my eyes and vainly trying to open them.

"Miss Ketridge expects the teacher to be dressed and ready to attend prayers while the clock is striking the hour of six," replied Miss Macdougal, at the same time, placing a small glimmering lamp, such as only served to make darkness visible, and then she left me to attend on her young pupils, in their dressing room, where I joined her soon as I had contrived to open my eyes and put on my clothes."

"Have you made your bed?" said Miss Macdougal, and answering in the negative, she told me that it was the established custom of Ketridge house, for both
B

### Page xxvi

teachers and scholars to make their beds before they left their apartment.

"Never mind," said I, while my teath chattered in of me head, "any thing to make my blood circulate, for I really fear that your nothern climate will cause my death, but may I not even see a fire, before I turn house maid."

"Oh! dear no," replied Miss Macdougal, shaking her head, and I went back to my room to obey orders, but my fingers were so completely numbed, that I made but a poor business of it. Miss Macdougal entered just as I had finished my bed.

"That won't do," said she, "Oh! How lucky it is, that Miss Ketridge did not see that bed, she is so extremely particular." Patience does wonders; I tried again, and felt satisfied with my improvement.

They went to prayers, and at last I was desired to seat myself at the foot of the breakfast table, opposite to Miss Macdougal.

Oh what a blessed sight was a large fire and something to eat and drink.

I soon dispatched my little roll, and then I begged to have a slice off the large loaf . Miss Ketridge exchanged significant looks with her Scotch teacher. No matter, since my wish was complied with, for that was all I cared about. The bleak northern air, added to the very landable scarcity and scantiness of provision at Ketridge academy, had given me an unusual appetite.

After breakfast, as the clock struck nine, I was commanded to place myself on a high stool in the schoolroom, at a distance from the fire, and listen to the miserable attempts of three gawkey Scotch girls to spell and read French, in rotation. At precisely eleven, Miss Ketridge entered the room, and presented me with a stiff gentleman's shirt to make, hinting at the perfect feasibility of a French teacher being employed several ways at once, like the Pandeans at Vauxhall.

"I am very sorry to say that I do not understand needle work," said I.

### Page xxvii

"Mercy on me," exclaimed the lady," what will become of you! what have your parents to answer for."

"I will try and learn how to make a shirt, madam," said I, "although I never understood that as a French and music mistress, I should be so employed."

"And how do you propose passing your evenings?" enquired the damsel.

"After the young ladies retired to rest I hoped I should have had an hour to myself," I replied.

"Yet Miss Macdougal is satisfied to employ herself in needle work till midnight," observed the school mistress.

To describe the petty torments and hardships I endure, would be difficult; vainly did I, while the children were croaking their vile French in my ears, in their broad Scotch accent, labour to become a model of shirt-making, or to excel in button holes; needle work was not my vocation, and my seat was perched up so far from the fire place, that I became numbed with cold. The scholars were most of them older than myself, although they appeared younger. A set of rawboned illiterate Scotch girls, who had scarcely heard a word of French spoken in their lives, till I came amongst them to make a fashionable accademy out of Miss Ketridge's boarding schoool for grown up dunces.

Once Miss Ketridge and her teacher laid their heads together and formed a plan to shame me out of eating more than the little flat roll. This was done by placing a loaf of six or eight pounds on my plate, and then tittering and laughing at one another, when I came to the table. A stranger, in ill health, and in a raw cold place, I felt for a moment rather forlorn; few very young people can endure ridicule unmoved, however undeserved. I am, however, of a contented disposition.

I had tried to do my duty in this unhospitable mansion, and would not despond, so on second thoughts, I thanked Miss Ketridge for her attention in making me such ample amends for her former scarcity of allow-

### Page xxviii

ance, then observing their sneers and giggling, I shook my head at them, whilst helping myself to a thick slice.

"'Tis a brilliant invitation, ladies," said I, "but you see it won't answer, as I never will be the simpleton to quarrel with my bread and butter."

I cannot describe what I endured on a dancing day, from cold, during that severe winter, dressed up in a muslin gown, and seated stock still in a long room, with eight large windows where the fire was lighted only once a week, and that at the very moment we entered; yet, I armed myself with patience, and remained six months in the north, but health may not be command. By this time I was afflicted with a severe constant cough, and my nose was drawn in, like a person's in a deep decline; in short, I looked so truly miserable and forlorn, sewing away at my hard shirt, that even Miss Ketridge at length was softened, and sent for the apothecary to prescribe something for my increasing cough, but when he mentioned warm milk from the cow and early hours, she advised me to consult him no more, assuring me that too much sleep was very injurious, and that as my real friend, she must beg me to perfect myself in the feminine necessary accomplishment of needle-work.

"Why are there so many gentlemen's shirts about this virgin's abode?" said I to Miss Macdougal one day, and was informed that she was quite a miser, and took in shirts to make.

I grew worse and worse, and was at length forced to take my place in the mail for London. I had received several letters from Tom Sheridan, who advised me to go on the stage. My face was the best stage face for tragedy, after Mrs. Siddons, whom he was polite enough to say I much resembled; and then the tones of my voice, he said, were well adapted for tragedy. He only wished to hear me read Shakespeare, in order to form a more decided opinion of my talents. If he found them equal to his expectations, he promised me all his father's best assistance, to get me well introduced and brought out at Drury-Lane.

### Page xxix

Tom Sheridan's letters were truly friendly, and I felt that I had excited his best and most benevolent feelings in my behalf, because, said he, "if others do not take care of you, I feel sure that you are the last person in the world to take care of yourself."

I feared it would be impossible to get rid of my natural shyness, or find nerve for appearing on the stage; however, such was my fixed abhorrence and dread of schools, that I resolved to try, and after I had been a short time at home, I prevailed on my mother, to permit me to read a passage in Shakespeare to Tom Sheridan, who had returned to London a short time before I left Newcastle.

She had the less scruple in doing so, because his letters were so very kind and brotherly, and we had known Tom Sheridan, with Lord Craven, and his brother Berkely, all our lives, in consequence of their living in sight of our house, and passing it constantly.

Tom Sheridan was quite delighted with my reading Shakespeare, and discovered that I had a turn for low comedy, as well as a beautiful voice for tragedy. But when I managed a sort of costume to play Falstaff, with a pillow shut up in the coachman's large waistcoat he laughed till he absolutely cried, without being able to alter a muscle of my countenance, so much had I identified myself in the character, whilst he read the part of King Henry, and I knew Falstaff, as far as manners went, was always a gentleman, and would not have laughed at his own wit or humour. I could not have done this if I had been the least in love with Tom Sheridan, but as that was not the case, and as I was play mad, I made an effort, and the encouragement I got, at length gave me confidence.

Sheridan afterwards assured me that he had not the smallest doubt of my ultimate success in any thing very tragic and pathetic, or very comic. My mother having such alarge family, would have fain consented, rather than have mepine away in a school, seeing that a sedentary life would never agree with my health, but when it was mentioned to my father, he fell into a violent passion, and declared he would rather see me in my grave. 

My reflections were now melancholy, my prospects a blank. And must I drag on a forlorn existence — so reasoned I at fifteen — and teach children Clementi's lessons, and the verbs "avoir," and "être," from fifteen to fifty years of age, and then to retire withered and still more forlorn, to a work house? And is it meant by nature that I should pass away from this world without having loved and been beloved? Why then does my heart glow with sensibility and tenderness? Why is this ardent desire to love with all my soul and all my strength implanted in my nature? What chance on earth have I of marrying a man of polished refinement? And well I feel the impossibility of attaching myself to any other. Who will scale the walls of any of these high dried academies, to propose marriage to me? The confinement will soon bring on a decline, and then will this pretty person of mine wither in solitude till it is changed to a hideous skeleton! No, I cannot "teach the young idea to shoot,"[1] death even were preferable.

These ideas had been tormenting me for three months, during which time I was almost daily reproached by my father for living in idleness and "eating the bread of my younger sisters and brothers," although I knew he was not so poor as he was stingy, when I once hoped to give him an agreeable surprise, for I loved my father almost romantically, and deep, indeed, was the wound his harshness inflicted. 

There was an ancient Swiss dish which he had once cooked himself, in my presence, as a curiosity, I had watched him with great attention, and one night when he was expected home to supper, I took infinite pains to prepare this dish, and succeeded. His supper was ready at my usual bed time ten o'clock, but I was so afraid it would get cold or spoiled that I sat up till his return, to watch it, and got soundly boxed on the ears, pour commencer. 

Nothing can be done with me by blows, I hate them, and I swore immediately to leave my wretched uncomfortable home, on the following day. My dear mother would forgive me, and visit me. Of that I felt sure, for she knew I should soon die if she forsook me, and for my father, strong indignation, at that moment, hardened my heart against him. I loved no one amongst those who sought to seduce me, but the Cravens were our near neighbours, and old acquaintances, and they were gentlemen. I was less afraid of them than any other men, so I became the mistress of Lord Craven.

## TO THE PUBLIC 

London, January, 1830. 

IT is but fair to state of a man who has been so harshly dealt by, that Mr. Stockdale, as my publisher, conducted himself towards me liberally and honestly. 

At the same time, I must, in justice to myself declare that in the latter part of my Memoirs, independent of much extraneous matter being introduced, under the head of *my* *Memoirs*, which never belonged to them, and for which *I* have been reproached; many expressions have been put into my mouth, which never issued from *my* pen. 

It is, therefore, to prevent a recurrence of the like annoyance, that I am compelled to acquaint the public, that Mr. Stockdale *has* now published nearly the whole part of my Memoirs which *I wrote* and sold to him in M. S. 

Some few *pages* may yet remain in his hands, but I should imagine, indeed, I am almost positive that of *my composition*, he cannot have sufficient to form a single number or part of a volume, such as was at first sold for half a crown. 

The M. S. of the remaining *unpurchased* and consequently *unpublished* parts, about half a dozen in number have not been *out of*, and are still *in* my possession, and without intention, at present, on my part, of being given 
to the public. 

I give this information very reluctantly, as I should be truly sorry, to injure the father of a family, of whom, with the above exception, I have no cause to complain.


## PREFACE
### Page xxxiii

A SKETCH-BOOK or light novel was what an illustrious, and in my opinion, very amiable nobleman strongly recommended me to write, a few years ago, instead of a comedy. A gentlemen belonging to the company of Edinburgh Reviewers[1], whom I consulted as to its merits, favored me with the following reply to my letter:

> Madam,
> I have many apologies to make for not having answered your letter sooner : yet, however, not to miss an opportunity of writing a letter of encouragement, after my former one of criticism; the plan you mention of a Novel or Work, like the Sketch-book, is, I think, very promising, and as far as I can judge, very well adapted to your talents. The risk and annoyance incidental to publications, are always less than that of dramatic adventure, and the profits, in case of success much greater. In case ofpublication, the knowledge that it was written by you, would insure a sale, so that at least people would be forced to payyou before they could abuse; whereas, in bringing out a play, the managers may get all the profit, and the author nothing but the abuse. I don't know that I can say any more or give any serviceable advice. Go on and prosper, and may you find Appollo and Parnassus, to the full as pleasant as Venus and Idalia.

### Page xxxiv
The writer of the above, is a well known whig from principle, a poet by inclination, a dramatist from taste, whose compositions were unfortunately untasted by the
public; an atheist, par excellence, and a very gouty subject, *malgré lui*.

I have, at length, resolved, to present to the public, such a Work as recommended, which, however, is chiefly founded on facts.

Fanchette, the little French repasseuse, who is introduced in the first volume, had resided in Italy with an Italian nobleman, whose real name I have concealed under that of St. Betise, when she hired herself to me, in Paris, as my waiting-woman, in January 1828. Fanchette referred me to her late master and mistress for her character, and it was on that occasion that I first visited the lovely Marchesa, whose noble husband having been banished from Italy by the Pope, at the instigation of her uncle the Cardinal * * * * they had travelled to Paris, and resided in the Rue Neuve des Petis Champs, in the immediate neighbourhood of the
Rue de la Paix.

I was so struck with the beauty of the Marchesa St. Betise, that I prevailed upon my new waiting-woman Fanchette, to relate to me whatever she knew about her late charming mistress. The girl was very intelligent, and spoke Italian fluently.

While travelling tête-à-tête with her in my carriage from Paris to Dieppe, we conversed constantly on the subject of the Marchesa, and the society about her, particularly of her ladyshp's uncle, the Cardinal...

The story of Laura, I believe to be true, but it does not regard the Marchesa St. Betise's uncle. The affair happened in Germany. The Marchesa St. Betise, is, by birth a Spanish woman.

The young Prince Orazio did a few days after the Marquis St Betise had been banished from his castle, which was not situated in Naples, but in another part
of Italy.

### Page xxxv

The summer house, the signal gun, intrigues, duels, &c. have been all so accurately and humourously described to me by Fanchette over and over again, as to leave no doubt on my own mind as to the exact truth of every circumstance; and they were corroborated by a letter of the young Prince's, addressed to his fair mistress, which Fanchette had found sewed up in the hem of the Lady St. Betise's morning dress, had stolen from her. It was written in French, and I took acopy of it, which my readers will find in my Second Volume translated verbatim.

The little Marquis is described with simple truth. Fanchette, I am convinced, did not *broder* or high colour his character. She delighted to describe what she had seen in Italy, and I could not but be amused by her lively animated discourse. Her descriptions were free from either malice or benevolence. Neither of us
were likely to meet with her Italian friends again, and it was now her business to amuse her new mistress, and beguile the time away as we travelled together.

Premeditated falsehood is easily detected, and as Fanchette's descriptionsbore the stampandcharacter of truth in all trifling details, which led naturally to the matter, I give , therefore, the St. Betise anecdotes to the world as facts, with a clear conscience and entire persuasion of their truth.

Alberto is a high coloured sketch of a gentleman's character now in England.

I have concealed the name of the noble mother of Napoleon Bonaparte's natural son, under that of Countess de Polignac. I was not acquainted with her, but I once passed some months in the country, near her chateau, where I heard much good of her, and Napoleon's son dined frequently at my house. She seldom visits Paris now, but in the country keeps up all the splendour and éclat of her rank, which is superior to what I have assigned to her by acts ofbenevolence to the poor, and hospitality to the rich.

Monsieur and Madam St. Sauveur, with their daughter, resided in Lyons in 1798, I have not disguised their names, having taken the account from a french news paper.

I have so far, however, varied the real story, as to make Ligonia the half, instead of the whole brother, and I have made some other trifling alterations which would destroy the interest of the narrative prematurely to anticipate in a preface.

It may be worth relating, as a curious fact, altho' purely a matter of chance, that after murdering his brother, Ligonia entered the Russian service as a private soldier, in which capacity he so often and signally distinguished, himself that he was, promoted to high rank, and in 1814, upon the occupation of Lyons by the Cossacks, he was absolutely billetted in his native town, upon his orphan niece's house!!

Having however changed his name, and being greatly altered by grief and service, he was not after such a lapse of time recognized by any one. Count Drognichieff commanded the regiment of Cossacks in which Ligonia served.

To the curious, or lovers of research, it may be satisfactory to mention that I have disguised the real name of "Ivancheff," which he bore in the Russian service, under that of Ligonia.

Anglo Neapolitans may perhaps, recognise an aquaintance in the Countess Diablo. I believed she is not yet
dead.

The Comtessa Lorenza is alive, but is cured of way-laying lovers in the dark.

Jacques Tracasse is taken from aliving character on the continent, who much amused me.

As the English characters which the Page Eugenio describes in his letters from London, are sketched from nature, they will, of course, resemble those of many persons in high life.

After declaring that mean no offence, I have only to add, that whoever may hit upon a cap to fit him, is welcome to wear it, whether it be adorned with "laurels," or "long ears."

"HONI SOI QUI MAL Y PENSE."

If amongst various others, I have intruded a sketch of my own character drawn with impartial truth, as I am a judge, it is, as I conceive, but a piece of common justice to myself, considering the virulence and disgusting slander which has been published on my subject.

True, I have in my Memoirs exposed many truths, which for the honor of our aristocracy, it had been desirable to have kept secret; but I have traduced no character by such FALSE calumnies as have been practised against myself. I, however, forgive all freely, and would not have introduced the matter here, but by way of apology for the intrusion of my own character amongst Eugenio's sketches of life and manners in London.

My object has been to keep as near to facts as possible, and to draw varied and spirited dramatic scenes, such as are likely to enliven and interest an invalid or a weary traveller, no matter at what Chapter he might open my book. I have endeavoured to avoid all prosy heavy descriptions in a work of this light nature.

"Il fault un peu de tout dans ce bas monde," and there appears to me to be no lack of learned books out already, professing morality, and pressing the reader to "read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest" as much of them as convenient.

My only chance, then, of benefitting mankind, with my humble abilities, is to offer to the sick, the indolent, and unlearned, a work they can understand, and will be at the trouble ofreading, instead of having recourse to some less harmless amusements.

I am aware that objections may be made to this work on the score of the various intrigues it describes. I hope, however, that whoever has read Gil Blas with pleasure, will not affect to be shocked at descriptions, at least as delicate and modest, as any contained in that most popular work.

If I have described the errors and vices incidental to humanity, if I have not painted all my females virtuous, and in Italy too, professing as I do to draw from nature, yet has their dereliction from virtue been invariably punished.

Triumphant vice is no where set forth.

The errors of the Lady St. Betise are the cause of much misery to herself, and disorder to her family.

Laura witnessed as shocking a sight, as could for punishment be inflicted on a mother.

The young Prince Orazio pays dearly for the indulgence of his guilty passion.

Alberto is a frank libertine who deceives no body, and possesses a thousand redeeming qualities, but Gil Blas is a cowardly knave, whose vices and dishonesty are rewarded by riches, and every honor being heaped on his head. I, therefore, humbly hope, my work is the more moral of the two.

As to plot, it is what I fear I have no sort of taste or talent for, and the reader may despise my faint brief attempt in that department, without the possibility of making me think worse of myself than I have always done hitherto.

I shall be more than satisfied, I shall be proud, if in spite of the faults, inconsistencies, and irregularities of all kinds which abound more in my work than almost any other, it yet is found to amuse, by its spirit, its originality, or effect, those who are either too unwell, or too indolent for more serious study; and as we are one and all occasionally placed in some of these predicaments, I humbly hope, that this my first work of imagination, will find favor; if it does, CLARA GAZUL may, perhaps, one day, continue her adventures, but if in these Three Volumes SHE has failed to amuse, you will hear no more of her - Not so the authoress, who will try again and again if life be spared her, because of her faith and belief that she was born to please you, and is bound to fulfill her destination.

To conclude, I shall feel grateful to any Editor or Reviewer who will be at the trouble of freely animadverting on the defects of my Novel, because I have the desire to improve, and I hope to benefit by impartial criticism.

## Chapter I - MY BIRTH AND EDUCATION.
### Page 1
My mother, Dona Euphrasia, was bred to the stage, so was my grandmother. My mother had made her successful debut at Madrid, ten years before I was born,

"On ne connoit pas toujours son pere, c'est un malheur."[1]

I was sent to a distant country to be nursed, and my mother continued her dissipated career. Luckily, I fell into kind hands. My nurse, Agnes, loved me; she was a young French woman, whose infant had been
born dead. When I had attained my fifth year, my

mother sent for me, and being struck with my beauty, began to speculate on the rich harvest it promised to her insatiable avarice.

To be brief, masters were provided for me, and no expense spared to render me an accomplished woman.

My nurse was hired to attend on me. My mother's violent temper and profligate habits, disgusted us both, whilst our affection for each other increased daily.

One night, soon after I had attained my fourteenth year, my nurse called me into her room, when throwing her arms about my neck, she burst into tears.

I soon learned from Agnes, that I was destined a victim of prostitution. She had overheard a conversation between Euphrasia and the rich Senor Don Gonzales, into whose

arms I was shortly to be delivered for a stipulated sum of money.

Our resolution was soon taken; death itself had been preferred by me to the hideous Don Gonzales.

We passed the whole night in arranging our flight, and early next morning beheld us already on the road, journeying towards France, with a small basket of provisions, a few ducats, the property of my nurse, and in the complete costume of two French peasants. We had such a dread of being overtaken, that we pursued our journey with a great swiftness on foot, or any humble conveyance that fell in our way. In less than three
weeks we passed the frontiers, and arrived at Lyons, exhausted and pennyless.

I was a high spirited girl, and too proud of my liberty to despond. Among other accomplishments which I had acquired under my mother's roof, I excelled on the guitar, and my voice was remarkably sweet. Agnes, had

brought my instrument slung across her shoulders. "Take courage, my dear Agnes," said I, "I can sing and play, and we will tell our story to some kind lady, who will pity us."

"Alas! My poor child," said Agnes, "it is for you I grieve who are so delicate, your poor little feet are bleeding, your shoes are worn out, and your clothes are torn. We must sell the guitar, since we have not the means where-with to procure a single meal." 

"I have bread and fruit in my basket," said I, with the buoyant spirit of extreme youth. "Let us seek out some shady retreat near a river, where we can bathe our feet and refresh ourselves."

It was on a delicious evening, in the month of July, quitting the town on the left, a winding lane led us to a most inviting spot, where, having unbound my hair, Agnes began to arrange it in decent folds about my head, while I bathed my feet in a clear brook that murmured amongst the trees.

Our simple toilette concluded, we began to

### Page 5

refresh ourselves with the contents of my basket, and forgot for a moment the forlornness of our situation. Night was advancing when our merriment was inturrupted by the sound of heavy footsteps approached us. Imagine our dismay, when four athletic male figures, with beards and moustachios of a tremendous growth, stood grinning before us, habited in a strange costume, such as we had never before beheld. The language of these wild looking beings was unintelligible, although my nurse had taught me to speak French almost as well as Spanish. The most hideous of them seemed to be expressing his admiration at the beauty of my hair and features, and another forcibly pressed his lips to mine.

I threw myself on my knees in dreadful alarm; Agnes tried to protect me, but was fiercely thrown aside. The savages surrounded me, and appeared to contend and quarrel among themselves. At this moment, a figure of

### Page 6

exquisite manly beauty, suddenly made his appearance from behind some trees.

He addressed our tormentors in a commanding voice and in their own language.

They immediately desisted, and saluted the stranger as soldiers salute their chief.

"You will protect us", said I, in Spanish, throwing myself at the feet of the handsome stranger, and raising my eyes beseechingly to his face.

He answered me in good Spanish, and the melancholy tone of his voice, added to the extraordinary beauty of his countenance, made that deep impression on my sanguine imagination, which no time or absence could efface. The stranger wore the same foreign style of dress or uniform, as that of the men, but of a finer texture. He apologised for the alarm his men had occasioned us, and informed us that his name was Ligonia, that they were a party of Cossacks under his command, and

### Page 7

quartered at Lyons; he then proposed protecting us to our home.

In a very few words, Agnes acquainted Captain Ligonia with the history of my life.

"Poor child," said he, in a tone of compassion, "I will endeavour to procure you some female friend, although, I am, myself, a stranger in this town. In the mean time, let us proceed toward the nearest inn, where I will place you under the care of the hostess, and make myself accountable for your expenses."

Overcome by fatigue, gratitude, and a variety of other sensations, I was nearly sinking at the feet of the stranger, who supported me with great kindness. His expressive face was pale as death, deep melancholy seemed to have stamped its seal for ever, on the finest of all human countenances. His age, I guessed, might be thirty-five, or there abouts, his eyes were sunk, but their fire was not extinguished.

I had never received a lesson on propriety

### Page 8

and knew not how to hide from the handsome stranger, the impression he had made on feelings, warm as my native climate, aided by the deep gratitude which his services so justly inspired.

When Captain Ligonia had succeeded in calming my agitation, and recommended us to the care of our landlady, he took his leave, promising to return on the following morning.

"Thank God! for our good fortune", said Agnes, as soon as we were alone; "we are in luck's way, my child, and though thrown on the wide world, we need not despair, since we are both young and willing to exert ourselves."

We gathered from our friendly hostess, that Captain Ligonia, with his friend the Count Drognichief, lived with a rich widow-lady, whose name was de Fleury, and that people talked of a match between Mademoiselle Fleury, and the young Russian Count.

### Page 9
We enquired if Captain Ligonia was a Russian by birth?

"No one knows," replied our hostess, "as the Captain speaks so many languages in perfection."

"He is, indeed," she continued, "a most accomplished gentlemen, highly esteemed by all who know him, rich or poor, yet is he ever a prey to the most desponding melancholy."

"But you are fatigued; my children," said she, observing that Agnes' head was nodding, then leading us to our comfortable apartment, she bade us good night, and we fell asleep in each other's arms.

### Page 10

THE next morning the gay carriage of the rich widow, drove up to the door of the inn, from whence alighted Madame de Fleury, and her daughter, the dashing,
graceful Mademoiselle Rosa.

"Oh! Qu'elle est jolie ! Qu'elle est belle!"[*] exclaimed both at once.

"How old are you, child? Are you really a Spanish girl born and bred?" and thus they continued to question me, till at length, having obtained my whole history from Agnes, Madame de Fleury, invited us to step into her carriage. We were set down at her beautiful residence, situated half a league from Lyons.

[*] Ah! How pretty she is! How beautiful!! - ED.

### Page 11

After Madame de Fleury had recommended Agnes to the care of her first waiting woman, Berthram, she invited me into the drawing room. I hesitated at first to enter in my simple dress, or rather disguise, but Raso seized my hand, and presenting me to the young Russian Count, who sat reading on a sopha, soon made him acquainted with my romantic adventures.

After some indifferent conversation, Madame de Fleury spoke to me as follows:

"I have under my protection, the niece of a dear friend. The poor young creature is deranged, but she has her intervals of reason, and is at all times perfectly harmless. Her physician has lately recommended me to seek out a lively young person to attend her as her companion, believing that she is disposed to the study of music."

"Does the young lady inhabit this house?" I asked.

Madame de Fleury pointed to a small, neat white building, at the bottom of her large

### Page 12

garden, and replied, "Mademoiselle St. Sauveur, and her two nurses, have for some time occupied that summer house," and she then promised to introduce me to the poor invalid on the first opportunity.

Captain Ligoniamade his appearance just before dinner was announced, he warmly expressed his satisfaction at finding me under the protection of Madame de Fleury, and conversed with much kindness on various subjects. He was the most sensible man I had ever met with; every body seemed to hang on his words, and delight in his conversation.

Madame de Fleury, as soon as we had dined, asked him if he would like to hear his little protegee sing a song, and on his expressing the pleasure he should experience at witnessing my performance, I was seized with a fit of trembling.

Love, all powerful love, however, soon furnished me with the tact of a more advanced age. The plaintive air I chose, was in unison with the melancholy tone of Ligonia's mind. I saw him brush a tear from his pale cheek, at sight of which, my voice died away in notes of such sofness that all were touched by it; then observing the effort that Ligonia made to recover his serenity, I struck up a merry madrigol, for which spirited performance, I had been much admired in my native country. "Bravo! Bravo!" was reiterated from every one in the room, and Captain Ligonia for an instant seemed to forget his deep melancholy, to smile at my efforts to amuse him.

It was late when I was permitted to retire with my nurse Agnes, to whom I related the proposal that had been made to me by Madame de Fleury to offer myself as companion to the unhappy young lady who inhabited the white building in the garden.

We soon fell fast asleep, and did not awake until Bertram, Madame de Fleury's woman, tapped at our door. She came by her ladies' desire to accompany me to the dress makers, and

### Page 13

procure for me a fashionable change of ready-made clothes that I might appear like a young lady of education.

Passing through the church-yard on our way to the dress-makers, we saw Captain Ligonia; he was examining the magnificent tomb which had been, as I was afterwards told, erected to the memory of Monsieur and Madame St. Sauveur, the parents of the poor deranged young lady Isabelle.

This tomb was said to be a master-piece of sculptural beauty, and attracted the admiration of all foreigners. As we approached it, I was struck with the deadly paleness of Captain Ligonia's face; he merely bowed to us and hurried away.

I was soon equipped in a neat white muslin dress, and large silk morning bonnet; Mrs. Bertram chose for my evening costume, a black satin dress with tight bodice, after the spanish fashion, which set off my delicate waist to the

### Page 14

greatest advantage; although scarcely fifteen years of age, I was tall, and though slender, was so far formed as to have been mistaken for eighteen, judging me only by my person, whilst my face was that of an intelligent child.

My features were regular, but my eyes were my chief beauty, than which none could be more expressive of strong sense and arch humour: their brightness was tempered by the sensibility that glowed from my heart.

Few loved truth and abhorred deception of every species more than myself, who had been so greatly disgusted with my mother's habit of hypocrisy.

Of religion I had heard seldom tell, except when my nurse had taught me to pronounce a short prayer on my knees, night and morning.

My reading had been chiefly confined to a few Spanish romances, yet I was not entirely unacquainted with French literature.

The French language delighted me, and I

### Page 15

spoke it like my mother tongue. But I will not dwell on my good or bad qualities, since my actions will best speak for me, and I beg pardon for this digression.


## Chapter III - I AM ENGAGED AS THE COMPANION OF A YOUNG LADY OF UNSOUND MIND; SOME ACCOUNT OF CAPTAIN LIGONIA.
### Page 17

HAVING purchased all the necessary little requisites to complete my morning and evening costume, and render it worthy the society of Madame de Fleury, we retraced our steps homewards; I found Mademoiselle Rosa in her dressing-room, she had just returned from riding with the young Count, who (as I soon learnt) had proposed, and been accepted as her future husband.

Come here and let me look at you, said Rosa, and having examined me at all points, she grew jealous, and confessed as much: an heiress is apt to be frank.

Madame de Fleury, in the course of that day, introduced me to Doctor Lambert, who was the

### Page 18

poor deranged young lady's physician; and he addressed me in about these terms.

"Hearing Mademoiselle that you are willing to offer your service to this afflicted and interesting young lady, I beg permission to acquaint you with a few particulars of her case, which happened in Italy.

"The parents of Mademoiselle St. Sauveur were my best friends. The death of Monsieur St. Sauveur was a shock which caused Madame St. Sauveur to be seized with the pangs of premature labour, and she died three hours after her child saw the light, but not until she had intreated me to watch over the poor orphan's health and happiness. Madame de Fleury, as her last surviving connexion, was chosen guardian of the young lady's fortune.

"No symptoms of insanity had been remarked in Isabelle, until she had attained her tenth year. The poor thing, now believes herself skilled in foretelling events; but I still hope to restore this lovely, and afflicted young lady to society.

### Page 19

"If I can only divert her mind, or fix it to some kind of study. I have said enough to you Miss Clara, and will now introduce you into her closet."

I was accordingly conducted into a small apartment adjoining Isabelle's sitting-room; At the first sound of my voice and guitar, Isabelle flew to the closet. She wore a simple white robe fastened round the waist by a ribbon. Her light brown hair fell below her girdle. Her cheeks were pale, and the unnatural fire of madness glowed in her eyes. She examined me with interest, stood at some distance from me, in the attitude of listening, with one of her delicate fairy fingers held up; I struck a few chords and murmured the first stanza of a Spanish hymn. Isabelle listened with rapture.

I ceased suddenly, and gently slung my guitar across her shoulders; she eagerly examined it, struck the chords with her fingers, and then returned it me in disguest at the unharmonious sounds she had produced; knelt down at my feet, and fixed her eyes beseechingly on my face. I raised her,

### Page 20

nodded assent, and tried the effect of a livelier air, she appeared to understand the very soul of music.

"We will live together Isabelle," said I, laying down my instrument, "we will sing together, and I will be your
companion."

"Your destiny does not lie with mine," said poor Isabelle, there is a fatality against it, she continued, "something tells me that I shall one day destroy your peace of mind; I have seen you in my dreams, but I have odd thoughts and fancies. There are times when, as now, I recollect all the incoherent things I have said and done, and then I weep, oh! 'tis shocking to know that we have seen in our minds eye, what in fact is no where else visible; to be aware that one is watched and chained up like a wild beast, nay more," continued Isabelle looking wildly about her, and pressing her hand on her forehead, "to feel that confusion here, which renders such bondage necessary."

"Oh, how shocking!" I exclaimed in the tone of genuine pity.

### Page 21

"I have seen a murderous hand raised against my life; I have seen blood flow, and the earth bestrewed with mangled human frames!! ... I have seen all this, and know it was but the vision of a disordered mind."

"They will pass away as dreams," said I, putting my arms round poor Isabelle's neck and kissing her, "these are fearful fancies, but we will charm them away with music."

"Do you not fear me then?" she asked.

"And why so my sweet delicate sister," I replied, "even though some shocking phantoms do disturb your mind? You shall learn of me to touch the light guitar, and we
will live together."

I passed the whole of the day with Isabelle, and at parting delighted her by my promise to return to her the next morning.

I found my nurse Agnes in high spirits. Albert, the Count Drognichieff's gentleman, had been very particular in his attentions to her; and she believed him to be an excellent young man.

### Page 22

I eagerly changed the subject, to enquire when she had seen Captian Ligonia?

"Poor dear gentleman," said Agnes, "I have just been talking about him to Monsieur Albert."

"And what said Monsieur Albert?" I asked eagerly.

The substance of what Agnes had gathered from the Count's Servant Albert, was simply this; that about fourteen years back, when the Count was a mere child, Ligonia had entered the regiment of cossacks, to which his father belonged as a private soldier, where, by his bravery and talents, he had immediately distinguished himself, and was soon promoted to the rank of captain; that higher honors had been tendered to him which he had declined. He spoke the Russian language without foreign accent, but as he had perfected himself in so many others, no one knew for certain from whence he came; that his grace and beauty had captivated the Count's sister; that his father who owed his life to the courage and generosity of Ligonia,

### Page 23

had desired to promote the match, provided he would have explained who and what he was, which Ligonia had refused to do, declaring that he should never marry under any possible circumstance; that he was adored by every soldier in the regiment to which he had attached himself, for his noble courage, charity and benevolence; that he seemed to be from the first independent in his circumstances, but so deeply oppressed with melancholy, as to endure existence only that he might lighten the hardships of the poor soldiers he commanded.

The deep interest I had before felt for Ligonia was increased to enthusiasm, by Agnes's account of his virtues and courage; and I was vexed to find that I could no longer keep her awake, to delight me with every trifling particular which she had gathered from her new admirer Albert.

##  Chapter IV - A SENTIMENTAL SCENE WITH A COLD LOVER - I RECEIVE A DANGEROUS WOUND FROM THE HAND OF A LADY - CAPTAIN LIGONIA RETURNS INTO RUSSIA - MARRIAGE OF MADEMOISELLE FLEURY - I ACCOMPANY HER TO NAPLES - SOME ACCOUNT OF MY TRAVELLING COMPANION
### Page 24

BUT few events occurred during the next four or five weeks: my performance on the guitar, had, by this time, got me in vogue at Lyons, where nothing was talked of but the Spanish girl and her guitar; and everybody's balls or assemblies were considered not worth attending, unless Madame Fleury would bring her protegee to play one little song, and accompany it with her beautiful voice.

From the first day of my attendants on Isabelle, her health was said to improve. I was 

### Page 25

her companion and music mistress, and her progress was rapid.

I saw Captain Ligonia, daily, and melancholy as he was, I could not help flattering myself that he liked my society. Those were indeed delightful moments to me, who loved for the first time, with all the impassioned ardour that my nature was capable of.

I was roused from my happy dream by the unwelcome news that Captain Ligonia proposed shortly returning to Russia, in consequence of the breaking up of the army of occupation that year (1818).

On his naming this resolution to me, I burst into tears. We were alone; Ligonia soothed me in terms of the gentlest pity; he could not be blind to the sentiments he had inspired, and he was too frank to affect ignorance on the subject.

"Clara," said he, feelingly, "you see before you an unhappy man, whose heart is dead to love, and whose mind is subdued by a weight of

### Page 26

anguish which renders existence a burthen to him; it has not, however, made me so callous, but that I can still desire to promote the welfare of one so young, so lovely, and so deserted."

As I listened to Ligonia's discourse, my tears fell unheeded down my cheeks.

"I would fain be as a parent or a brother to you Clara, continued he, pressing my hand, and looking at me with tenderness, but my mind is so disturbed. I cannot direct you; yet, I do believe, you love me, Clara, and your affection may be proved towards me in a way to afford me much comfort. Attend to the little counsel I can offer you; subdue your passions; acquire the command of them as you would save yourself from crime and destruction. We may meet again, Clara. Let me find you a respected, useful member of society."

"And will you smile kindly on me, if you hear, that unaided by a single friend, I shall have subdued my passions, and learnt to merit the esteem of the wise and the good?"

### Page 27

"Alas! Clara, save in bitterness of spirit, I shall never, I fear, smile again."

"Oh! What hope will support me then?" said I, sobbing aloud: "Who, in this dreary world, where I am a stranger, shall speak comfort to me?"

"Vainly would you come to me for comfort, poor Clara," said Ligonia, while his beautiful countenance, bore the fixed character of despair.

"I will be all you wish," continued I. "If I live and preserve my senses, I will never love you less than at this moment."

"And suppose you were to discover that your affections had been fixed on a man whose vices were ...."

"I can suppose no vice," I could not pardon in you Ligonia, I interrupted.

Clara, you have soothed some of my bitterest feelings, and rendered me for a moment less wretched: we may meet, perhaps, when you least expect it. Of one
thing, be certain,

### Page 28

that I shall not cease to interest myself for your happiness. Let me hope that my advice has been of service to one of my fellow-creatures."

Ligonia refused to be more communicative, as to what chance I had of ever meeting him again. When he was about to take leave of me, I wept bitterly.

"May God bless you, Clara! Pray for me, poor Clara," said he, and he was going; a phantom obstructed his path! Isabelle stood before him, pale as a corpse; her attitude was menacing, her eyes darted fire, and her hair was dishevelled. This sudden apparition seemed to appal the very soul of Ligonia, who uttered a deep groan. On a sudden, Isabelle snatched up a pruning knife which the gardiner had accidentally left in her path, and aimed it, with the quickness of thought, at the breast of Ligonia, whose face was covered with his hands, as
if to shut out from his sight some terrific object.

I sprang forward, and throwing myself on Ligonia's bosom, received the intended death wound

### Page 29

for him in my shoulder. At sight of the blood, which flowed from the wound, Isabelle's loud screams brought both servants and neighbours to my assistance. Let the reader judge of their surprise and consternation at the scene that presented itself.

Ligonia was on his knees, his features covered with a deadly paleness, was employed in endeavouring to stop with his handkerchief the blood which flowed from my wound.

As I shortly afterwards fell into a deep swood, I cannot describe what followed.

On my coming to my senses, I found myself in bed, Agnes and the physician were watching by my side. For several days, I was not permitted to speak: my wound was dangerous, but the excellence of my constitution aided my recovery.

As soon as I was permitted to converse, I gathered the following particulars from Agnes. The doctor had forgotten to fasten the door of Isabelle's apartment, who
finding herself at liberty, had

### Page 30

wandered towards that part of the garden where we stood. No one could account for those symptoms of horror and abhorrence which she evinced at the sight of Ligonia. Conjectures were fruitless, since Ligonia had served in Russia nearly as long as Isabelle had been born. The attempt she had made on his life could, therefore, only be attributed to the sudden freak of a maniac.

Poor Isabelle was consequently more closely watched than usual. On being questioned why she attempted such a crime, she had shewn so much agitation, and spoken so wildly, that the physician had thought it prudent, to change the subject, and her attendants were forbidden to recur to it.

Ligonia, who was still an inmate of Madame de Fleury, as soon as I was permitted to converse, took an affectionate leave of me.

"Alas!" said he at parting, "could one fatal hour be blotted from time, we might enjoy more happiness

### Page 31

than usually falls to the lot of man; but it cannot .... must not be."

"Ligonia," said I, "your will and pleasure be ever sacred to me, when that sweet countenance which I now gaze on shall be seen no more, when immense space shall divide us, and when I hear of you no longer, methinks I shall have ceased to exist for ought, save stern duty and severe privation. I ask no promises, I will accept no pity, and I claim no merit, that I threw myself between you and danger, for it was the act of involuntary impulse. If ever my affection can comfort you, you will seek me; in the mean time be free. It shall be my ambition to deserve your esteem, with that of all good men, and every evening while the sun is setting, I will fervently pray to the Father of all good to give you comfort."

Ligonia clasped me to his heart in a short but fervent embrace.

"Be assured," said he, "that the heart that turns 

### Page 32

from you Clara, shall never enjoy woman's love," and he disappeared.

The physician found my pulse high. My relapse was very serious; for eight days, my life was despaired of.

When I recovered, I learned that Ligonia was on his road to Russia, having left Lyons immediately after our last interview, but first he had deposited a purse of gold with Agnes for my use.

Shortly after the departure of Ligonia, Rosa informed me that the young Count Drognichieff had proposed to her, and been excepted, that an early day was fixed for their marriage; immediately after which, they had determined to proceed to Naples.

Rosa invited me to accompany her, which invitation I joyfully accepted, and promised to hold myself in readiness.

In the mean time I received a visit from Doctor Lambert, who came to take his leave of me, being about to accompany Mademoiselle St. Sauveur to England.

Since the attempt she had made in her frenzy on the life of Ligonia, her

### Page 33

mind had conjured up some horrible images respecting him. All her medical attendants had therefore recommended change of scene to the poor invalid, who would leave Lyons for London on that very evening, after which they proposed passing a few months in Italy. The Doctor having shook me cordially by the hand, and expressed his hopes of meeting me in Naples, took his departure.

In another month the nuptials of Count Drognichieff and Rosa were celebrated at Lyons, and the next day we were all three journeying on our road to Naples, accompanied by Agnes and her new lover Albert, (the Count's servant) Rosa's femme de chambre Pauline, and three male domestics. The bride and bridegroom travelled tête-à-tête in their travelling chariot, the large family coach was loaded chiefly with baggage, and the inside occupied by myself, Agnes, Pauline, and a little repasseuse whom the Count had engaged in Paris, at the recommendation of a great countess, not for himself

### Page 34

but for the service of a Neapolitan marquis whose name was St, Betise, and she assured the Count "que la petite repasseuse dont il vouloit bien se charger seroit un vrai trésor pour son cher ami a Naples, M. le Marquis de St. Betise; vu, qu'il tenoit a avoir ses chemises plissees dans la plus haute perfection.[*]"

Rosa and the Count would have had me travel with them, but besides the scruples I felt to interfere with their tête-à-tête, I experienced, in my present melancholy tone of mind, a strong antipathy to the idea of witnessing two happy lovers during their honey-moon.

The Countess, however, never treated me as an inferior, but insisted on my dining at her own table.

Pauline, her dashing waiting woman, turned up her nose at my poor simple nurse Agnes;

---
[*] That the little laundress, of which he was so polite as to take charge, would turn out quite an acquisition to his friend at Naples, the Marquis of St. Betise; and most essentially so, as he was so particular in having his shirt frills got up, and plaited in the highest very highest perfection.

Perhaps some degree of jealousy existed between them ; I suspected
that Albert was the prize for which they contended. The
little French repasseuse possessed more ready wit than
modesty ; she wore a smart green silk apron, adorned
with full trimmed pockets, and a cap ornamented with
rose coloured ribbons, a little rouge, and a great deal of
sandy hair ; her pretensions to beauty were very mo-
derate, indeed, I was greatly surprised at the choice of
the Count's friends in Paris, of this female who appear-
ed so deficient in every amiable quality.

## Chapter V - SERENADING AND SERENADERS - JEALOUSY IN LOW LIFE - HONOR DEFINED BY A FRENCH COOK SHEWING WHAT A HOLD VANITY HAS ON THE PASSIONS OF MAN - A HOAX

As we passed through Italy, everybody exclaimed at
the dirt and poverty which was mingled with splendour
so as to completely destroy its effects .
But I, as a Spaniard, saw nothing to astonish me in a
fine castle loaded with rich furniture, paintings, and
precious stones, while the lower stories were appropria-
ted for filthy stalls where squalid penurs reigned, with-
out regard to order or decency.
The twanging of innumerable guitars, was as fre-
quently heard in this country of an evening as in my
own, and the Italians are better musicians but the high-
er romantic spirit of serenading exists in Spain, or may
be I am partial in saying so much.
In Italy, every barber, as a means of adding some
touch of refinement to the expression of his coarse de-
sires, has recourse to a guitar, on which he contrives
fromhis good ear to accompany his voice. The same
love rigmarole, to the same air is twanged all over the
towns atmidnight ; the number of guitars being regu-
lated by the fortune of the serenader, or by the degree
of respect and love which the object has inspired.
I have heard fifty or sixty guitars at a time, twanging
merrily under my window, after I had returned from vis-
iting one of the theatres with the Count and Rosa ; nay
Fauline too was serenaded by three musicians one night
at Bologna. To shew what a hold vanity has on the
passions ofman, Albert was just growing tired ofPau-
line, and henow conceived she mustbe an angel. Pau-
line onher part, elated with what she pretended was
60 CLARA GAZUL .
proofpositive of the wonderful effect of her charms, in
her turn began to treat Albert with high disdain. Albert
had served three years with his young master in Russia,
he had certainly been once, half in love with Pauline.
Reflecting on these weighty subjects, he began to fan-
cy himselfjealous, and to think about his honour, not
that he quite understood what the word meant.
He would fain have consulted some military hero on
the subject, but being ignorant of their language, he ad-
dressed himselfto Pedro the French cook.
Pedro was a merry wag who had formerly kept a
gambling house in Paris, until he had been forced to
emigrate for the simple circumstance, of having at a
game ofwhist, when a large sum of money was at stake,.
kept all the honors to himself.
Honor, said the Frenchman as soon as Albert had
sharpened his wit by a cup of wine, " honor is ofvarious
sorts and kinds ; the honor of a man-cook requires that
he should send to table adelicious repast, a tailor's honor
is in his measure, for if he mismeasures, he is dishonored ;
the honor of a justice of peace rests in his prudence,
and he may commit any body but himself ; the honor
of a prime minister is to keep down the opposition ; and
the honor of an Italian actress dwells, as you well
know, with the number and high rank of her lovers.
But speak to me ofmilitary honor ! said Albert im-
patiently. Military honor consists in never flinching from the
bottle said Pedro, filling both their glasses.
True, replied Albert, after swallowing a bumper, but
onthat point I have ever conformed religiously to the
rules prescribed ; but suppose a man tries to seduce
my mistress , what says honor to that ?
Speak you of Italian honor ?
I speak of military honor.
Yes! but 'tis widely different in Italy and in France :
which will you have ?
Either is good enough for me ; give me the most
simple .
CLARA GAZUL. 61
Inthis country then it is the custom to stab the offen-
der in the dark !
ARome comme a Rome, said Albert , taking up his
hat, his mind bent on deeds of blood.
It was striking eleven o'clock when Albert left the
French cook, who had received him in his bed room.
As he traversed the corridors in his way towards the
kitchen, he met Agnes, who told him that supper was
ready. Albert pushed her on one side with such rude-
ness, that the pooryoung woman burst into tears. Al-
bert relented, he could have given her his heart and
best affections, whom he esteemed for her gentle virtue
ifany body would have but given her a serenade. In
themean time, but little glory was attached to a con-
quest which no one coveted or contended for, so having
begged her pardon, and excused himself from joining
her at supper, he hastened towards his own bed room,
where he armed himself with his travelling dagger and
small pair of pocket pistols, and then hurried into the
street .
Here he began to parade up and down under Pau-
line's window.
His courage, for the first quarter of an hour, was
firm and terrible ; the fumes of the wine he had just
swallowed, had worked him into a jealous phrensy, and
he grasped his dagger with a savage gripe. Towards
midnight he began to reflect seriously on what he was
about. Suddenly he heard the twang of several guitars.
The night was dark, and Albert advanced unperceiv-
ednearly close behind the musicians. They were three
in number, as before, and appeared to be mere lads ;
they sang a pretty amorous ditty, which they accompa-
nied with some skill.
Villains ! cried Albert, who could contain himself no
longer -Rogues ! Thieves ! away with you, or I will
send a brace ofpistol bullets through your empty heads
anyou dont leave off your twanging ; saying which, he
seized hold of the youths by the collar , one after the
62 CLARA GAZUL .
other, and flung them to the earth with the greatest pos-
sible ease.
Murder ! murder ! rape ! murder ! screamed out the
poor musicians, as they each measured their length on
theground. However, it was soon evident, that two out of the
three had escaped death from the dread hands of the ter-
rible Albert, since they were no sooner down than up
again, and scampering towards the kitchen, as though
old nick had been in pursuit of them. But the last of
these three amorous heroes happened to be less fortu-
nate, If one might judge from the noise he made, and
from his continuing on the earth, just where Albert had
tossed him.
Wretch ! you have broken all my bones, screamed
out the prostrate youth, in good French.
The Count, Rosa, and myself, accompanied by the
hostler and the maitre d'hotel, attracted and alarmed by
this midnight disturbance, hastened to the outer gate.
We arrived just in time to witness a most ridiculous
scene .
Albert had picked up the wounded hero, and
was carrying him towards the kitchen. He was mask-
ed, and beingplaced on the dresser, persisted in declar.
ingthat his bones were all broken.
Surely, said the Count, this youth has got on my sur-
tout ! and holy Virgin ! exclaimed Albert, these are
your Lordship's overalls. We have caught a thief ! -
Here Pedro ! Pedro ! send for an officer ! -Take the
rogue into safe custody, bawled out the maitre d'hotel.
Spare me ! Pardon me ! Pardon ! said the phantom,
suddenly rising from the dresser, and tearing off his
mask, he fell prostrate at the feet of the Countess.
It was Pauline, as large as life, who had been serena-
ding herself ; grown desperate at the change in Albert's
manners since he had become acquainted with Agnes,
she had imagined this stratagem to rouse the jealousy
of her ci- devant lover, and induced the little repasseuse,
with the kitchen maid, to accompanyher, after leaving

alight in her bed room, and putting the key in her pock-
et .
Bursts of laughter now resounded from all quarters ;
the Countess pitying the extreem distress of her woman,
Pauline, refrained from reproaching her ; Agnes, instead
oftriumphing in the disgrace of her rival, feeling her gen-
tle heart melted with pity, offered to lead Pauline out of
the room.
Bruised and crest- fallen, the poor self -serenader, was
easily prevailed upon to go and hide her diminished
head.

IN WHICH FANCHETTE THE LITTLE FRENCH REPAS-
SEUSE RELATES HER ADVENTURES.
We continued our journey towards Naples, by short
stages. One day when we had exhausted many subjects of
conversation, and had been silent, for some time, the
little indefatigable repasseuse, whose name was Fan-
chette, proposed that each should relate the adventures
of her life.
My story was soon told ; Pauline's had little interest
in it, but the French woman's account of herself, begin
more lively, I will endeavour to give it my readers in her
own words.
" My mother was a repasseuse, and I was bread up
to her trade . Having at the age of nineteen, become
intimate with a very profligate set of girls ; my mother,
under the idea of separating me from the connection I
had formed, procured me a place offemme de chamber,
to Madam la Marquise de la Croix, who was so cele-
brated in Paris, for her beauty and whimsical disposition.
The Marquise her husband, was a stiff formal pair de
France, about forty years of age. His beautiful wife
was only fifteen, when I entered her service. All the
men were in love with her, but though she was the gay-
est of the gay, and dressed herself in the most extrava-
gant eccentric and coquetish manner, yet was her virtue
never suspected. We led a merry life at the Marquis
de la Croix's, and drank champagne constantly at the
second table. Heaven defended me from an ugly mis-
tress, who is sure to understand domestic duties, and
regulate the expenses and table of her servents, whilst a
beauty is absorded in the delights of making and pre
CLARA GAZUL. 65
serving conquests. The Marquis thought only of his
lovely wife, when he was not more deeply engaged with
his senatorial duties .
" Though my mistress was indifferent to all her other
noble conquests, yet I could not help fancying that she
distinguished her cousin, whom she called Alfred, with
peculiar attention. Alfred, was a novice in the gay world
amere student, hot from the university, all passion and
sensibility. He was a sweet pretty youth to look at, with
a dimple in his cheek like a woman's. I was told that
he was clever and accomplished too, and I remarked,
he sang like a nightingale, and his breath was as sweet
as a rose.
It was easy for every one to observe, how he loved
his cousin, but I believe the idea of possessing her, never
once entered his young head, when the anecdote I am
about to relate to you took place. But first, I must ac-
quaint you that though the Marquis and his wife loved
each other dearly, yet they quarrelled like dog and cat,
often for the most absurd trifles , and they would kiss and
make it up, as other married people do. The Marquis
would then ransack all the jeweler's shops in the Palais-
Royal, for some new fanciful bauble to present to his
pretty pet-wife, who used to vex aud tease him so much
occasionally, and particularly when she taught her par-
rot to call him odd names, such as, vieux emplatre-
fane -passe-blase-ci-devant jeune-homme,* &c.
On one of these occasions, the Marquis so complete-
ly lost his temper and his manners, as literally to have
laid his childish wife across his knees, and actually
whipped her smartly with a rod, as though she had been
an infant.
My mistress was, generally speaking, as sweet in
temper, as she was lovely, and though in a tremendious
passion at the moment, soon forgave her husband for
the unwarrantable liberty he had taken with her.
* Youdrone of a fellow !-you dried up -done up -worn out

66 CLARA GAZUL.
Unhappily for the Marquis, he was of a fidgetty tire-
some temper, and knew not how to be quiet when he
was well off . Not content with having whipped his
beautiful wife , he had the folly to boast of it in her pre-
sence, and before at the least twenty visitors .
" Re-
gardez moicette belle sauvage, cette beaute fere, said he,
half in kinddess, half ironically ! Qui croiroit qu'elle a
ete fouettee mais bien fouettee fouettee com-
...
....
me il faut* ! "
The young countess's cheek glowed deep scarlet.
Sherushed out of the room, flew up stairs to join hercou-
sin, who residedin the house, invited him to her boudoir,
and when she returned to the saloon, where she left the
astonished company, she addressed them as follows , in
a loud voice : " Messieurs et mesdames j'ai l'honneur
de vous annoncer que vons voyez la, devant vos yeux
monsieur le Marquis de la Croix, que vient a l'instant
d'être coiffe-mais bien coiffe-coiffe comme il faut !!
-Demandez a mon cousin. " †-Every body opened
their eyes, but were tongue- tied with astonishment.
The marquis knew the world, and affected to consider
this story as a joke ; in short, up to this day, he has nev-
er acknowledged that he believed one word of it, al-
though I am persuaded that no man knew the character
of his wife better than the Marquis. However that may
be, they have lived upon such excellent terms, that my
master has never once had recourse to birching his lady
from that hour; neither do I, in myconscience, believe,
that the beau cousin, was ever again permitted to be-
come an instrument of revenge to the Marchioness de

la Croix*. The Marquis had an ugly knack of put-
ting his ear to the key hole of the servant's office, in
order to listen to our discourse.
One night, after the Marchioness had been thus re-
venged on him, he heard me relate the circumstance of
my having been an eye- witness of the tête-à-tête be-
tween the Marchioness and her cousin, from the key
hole of the room adjoining her boudoir, when instead of
pardoning me for such curiosity, as he was, himself , in
the habit of gratifying by the like means, even on much
less interesting occasions, he, without further ceremony,
turned me out of doors .

## Chapter VII.
CONTINUATION OF FANCHETTE'S ADVENTURES .
My talents, as a repasseuse, however, soon procured
me a good post with a prude of the name of de Vallier,
who resided with her husband at her chateau near Ver-
sailles.
This lady was a strict catholic, and led us a very dull
life, making us attend mass, twice a day, and fast the
whole of lent.
Madame de Vallier was not half so beautiful as my
late mistress, although possessed of some charms ; she
was a weak, vain, amorous woman, and I soon contri-
ved to flatter her weak side, till I obtained her confi-
dence. Listen, said she, one day to me, as I sat by her
bed- side, at work, while she sipped her chocolate. I have
a good opinion of you, and believe you trust worthy.
I expressed my gratitude, and my anxiety to deserve
her flattering predilection in my favor.
As a reward for your fidelity, take this purse, contin-
ued my mistress, presenting me with one that was toler-
ably well lined .
After much preamble , and many attempts to blush,
she acknowledged that she adored ayoung military
hero, by name De Julien, who was the constant visitor
of her husband.
Madame de Vallier proceeded with her confession,
in about these words : -" Although my lover returns
mypassion, we have found it impossible to gratify our
wishes, owing to my husband's indefatigable zeal in
watching our very looks, andhis obstinate perseverance
inaccompanying me wherever I go. Cependant ce
que femme veut, Dieu veut* ; and I have hit upon a

CLARA GAZUL. 69
planthat with your assistance cannot fail. Remember
your fidelity shall be well rewarded, whilst the least in-
discretion on your part, will cause your immediate dis-
missal. "
Having made the warmest professions of good faith
and honor, the lady proceeded to explain her intentions,
as follows :
" De Julien dines here to day ; at ten, in the evening,
he will take his leave, our footman, Ambrose, remains
absent till to-morrow night. When your hear De Ju-
lien descend the stairs, open the gate, and affect to let
him out. Having shut it again with a loud noise, you
have only to lead De Julien, into your small sitting
room down stairs. Take care to place lights , and
whatever may be necessary, before hand."
Willingly, Madam.
"You will then, " continued my mistress, " go to your
bed, and I command you on no account to leave it till
the morning, not though I should ring my bell for an
hour together."
The heavy purse I still held in myhand had put me in
such excellent temper, that I vehemently protested and
promised my mistress that all her wishes should be
blindly obeyed.
Alas, continued my mistress, with uplifted eyes, how
arbitary is the passion of love ! How impssible to over-
come !
Then do not attempt impossibilites, Madam, said I.
I have before hand made up my mindto do heavy pen-
ance for this sin, said my mistress, and left me.
Every thing succeeded to our wishes , and De Julien
being safely lodged in my sitting room, my mistress and
master shortly afterwards went to bed. I soon follow-
ed their example.
At midnight I was awoke out of my sleep by a vio-
lent ringing of my mistress's bell, which tingled loudly
and without intermission for nealy three quarters of an
hour, after which, all was still as death.
70 CLARA GAZUL.
My mistress went out early the next day to confess,
but did not once allude to the circumstance of the night
before. No suspicion whatever was entertained by the
tender husband , and all went on smooth, for more than
aweek. But it happened that De Julien had a friend
who was quartered at Versailles, whom he loved as a
brother. The discretion of a Frenchman in love affairs,
is not always to be depended upon. De Julien's in-
trigue with Madame de Vallier, was too piquante ; the
story of the bell too amusing to be buried in his own
breast, so under promise of strict secrecy, he related it
to his friend, taking care, however, to conceal the name
of the lady. His friend repeated it to almost every of-
ficer in the Regiment, and thus it got round to Jacques
Tracasse, the barber of the adjoining village, near our
chateau , a tooth- drawer, and merry fellow to boot, pos-
sessing an infalliable remedy for the lumbago, and an-
other for dyeing hair.
The said Jacques Tracasse was well known to all the
good families about Versailles, many of whom preferred
sending to him at his village, which was at some dis-
tance, to employing any one of the town, partly on ac-
count of his excellent talents , as a hair dresser, but
chiefly because of his lively humour. He was, in fact,
a most amusing gossip, and it became the fashion to
send for Jacques Tracasse, as an occasional remedy for
the spleen, as the English people call it.
But to proceed with my story ; the French are a fic-
kle race, and De Julien having succeeded in a tete-a-
tete with his mistress, as I have described, neverthought
of trying to obtain a second, on the contrary, in a few
days afterwards , he procured six months leave of ab-
sence, and departed for a distant country.
This insulting conduct, so engaged my mistress, that
her former passion was converted into hatred , and she
called down vengeance and many imprecations upon
De Julien's head, vowing she would renounce the whole
sex.
GLARA GAZUL. 71
Soon afterwards she sent for two female relations to
come and reside with her, but cruel and false as may
be those vile men, there is, it should seem, no such thing
as dispensing with them. My mistress and her two fe-
male friends did nothing but yawn from morning till
night, or they would sit fortune-telling, and promising a
brace of new lovers to each other at every cut of the
cards.
My mistress's husband was a merchant, whose affairs
detained him continually at Paris. When at home, he
acted the husband to perfection, just as I have seen that
character performed at every place where I have lived.
I don't mean to say that there are no light and dark
shades, and that all husbands are exactly alike, because
some I have seen, who in society seem perfect models,
ever calling their wives " my dear," or," mysweet one, "
giving them the warmest seat by the fire, and speaking
of them to their friends, with the highest respect ; whilst
others more frank and natural, will call their wife a fool
before all the world, and ever keep the warmest seat by
the fire, to the astonishment of all the well- bred part of
the company . This latter class, I must say, have gen-
erally been in private, the best husband, and some of
these have, in their hearts, really loved their wives next
and second only to themselves ; but bad are the best.
All husbands consider their wives as patient tools, des-
tined to bear more harsh usage, and insulting taunting
remarks, than the lowest meniel would endure for an
hour ; being bound in honor and decency to stand by
them in their poverty and gaunt misery, not ajot the less
firmly, when they have brought it on by their
owncareless extravagance or profligacy. True, most hus-
bands will stand by their wives, fight, nay, die for their
wives, should they be suddenly in danger of violence or
ill usage, but these occasions are rare, and in the mean
time the wife is daily neglected and ill used, because,
bear it she must , and forgive it she must, since she is
fastened for life to him, and to force her chains is but to

incur disgrace, and have the finger ofscorn pointed at
her, orbe reduced to the hard case ofperpetual celibacy.
But I am straying from my story.
One Sunday afternoon my master being in a livelier
humour than usual, his wife proposed sending for Jac-
ques Tracasse, to amuse her two female friends, who
hadnever seen him. We will pretend to have the lum-
bago, or to want some of his box-combs, of which he
talks so much said my mistress ; my master was de-
lighted with the idea, and Tracasse being sent for, soon
made his appearance.
Figure to yourself a draper, sturdy built little man,
about five and forty years of age, scarcely five feet high
with a little periwig on his pate, covered with stale po-
matum, and a small cocked hat placed erect over all,
his face round, his eyes bright and twinkling, his nose
red and snubby, with a comic expression of the mouth,
small even black teeth, a dingy skin, and whiskers of
no given or acknowledged colour, but dusty reddish, or
red dusted with brown powder.
The costume of Jacques Tracasse, had been, as I
was told, uniformly the same for the last fifteen years .
A short coat of light stone blue, fashioned somewhat
like un habit de chasse, nankeen knee breeches, with
pearl flat buttons, blue cotton stockings, shoes up to his
instep, and large buckles ; a neat plaited frill to his
shirt, and a small stiff black cravat, which looked as if it
half choaked him under which he was perpetually dig-
ging his two fore fingers, in the vain attempt of giving
more breathing room, without disturbing the fatal knot,
which looked, as if, it had not been united for half a
century. Add to this sketch, an old neatly darned white
quilted- waist coat, and one- third of a Swiss check snuff-
pocket handkerchief , which was to be seen at all times
dangling out of his coat pocket, and Jacques Tracasse
stands before you.
On entering the room he just lifted his little cocked
hat , two inches from his head, while shrugging up his

shoulders, he bowed; and then replacing itwith its usu-
al starch precision, said " votre serviteur tres humble, "

I can't fancy how it happened, that Cæsar was such a
devil of a fellow ! Will you hear the news, fair ladies , or
shall I dress your hair ?
The news, the news, Tracasse, give us news, for
we are moped to death, said my mistress.
Oh ! I hate scandal, said my master, yawning, then
added, but Tracasse, you are quitea character, how long
have you lived in this neighbourhood ? do sit down man
in that chair, and give some account of yourself ! Its
done in the twinkling of an eye, said Tracasse, tapping
his large snuffbox.
Commencons par le petit verre, said my master, offer-
ing the barber a glass of curious liqueur, who having
swallowed it, smacked his lips, and pitched his finger
under his cravat with a wry face, he hemmed to clear
his voice, and then delivered himself as follows :
I was born in the Pays de Vaud, my father, a respec-
table Swiss gentleman, wanted to make a merchant of

Lausanne, but I felt such a strong predilection for the
stage, and such ahatred to the business of a clerk, that
I resolved to run away to Paris. Having performed
this journey on foot, I presented myself to some of my
father's relations, who, after scolding me for my diso-
bedience, pitied myyouth, and gave me a small sum of
moneyto begin the world with. This put meinhigh spirit.
Having hired a back garret in the Rue St. Jacques,
I passed whole days in studying for the stage, stamping
raving, dying, and singing, by the hour together. At
last, my neighbour, in the front garret, who was an au-
thor, threatened to complain to our landlord of the noise
I made. I called him a grovelling minded wretch, who
wanted to clip the wings of my soaring genius, and ask-
edhim howhe dared interrupt ayouth like me, in his
studies.
At least, said the poor devil, since you prevent me
from working by day light , give me a few candles, that
Imay continue my book while you sleep.
Ipushed him out of my room by the shoulders .
The next day, the gentleman who lodged under me,
gave notice to quit, on account of my stamping my foot
so vehemently exactly over his head, while exercising
myself in a deep tragedy. My landlord, to preserve a
more prof itable lodger, turned me into the street. I
proceeded, but little dismay, at this accident, towards a
a small country town, and presented myselfto the mana-
ger.
Having a fine voice, they egaged me at thirty sous a
night.
Igot on better than I expected; and improved daily,
but grew very thin on my poor stipend of thirty sous
per night, out of which I had to deduct my wig's , gloves,
and various articles of dress . However, I looked for-
ward to better times.
In three months, my salary was increased, and
before the end of the year, I obtained an engagement at
Calais, at twenty franks aweek.
CLARA GAZUL. 75
To shew you what trifles stamp our future destinies,
one night when I played the first part in a popular tra-
gedy, in which I was required to kneel down and offer
up a prayer to Heaven, I began, bytaking of my hat.
Here a heavy disaster befel me, mywig being too large
for my head, came flying offat the same time and in my
zeal, I dashed it exactly in the face of the youth who
was performing with me. He was a shy nervous young
man, who had that night appeared on the stage for the
first time ; my wig flapping right in his face, frightened
him to such a degree, that he was disqualified for the
rest of the evening, while no one missed it from my
head, owing to my own excellent hair, and to the row of
extra curls which were separately attached to my collar.
But though I got off with éclat, yet as it wasat the
expence of one of our company, I fell into a violent pas-
sion with the barber, of whom I had hired my wig, for
having so shamefully misfitted me. Ever after, dread-
ing the like accident , I used to patch and alter my wigs
myself , until I acquired a taste for periwing-making,
which I improved under the able tuition of Charles Bap-
tiste, who was bread to the trade, and at length I be-
came a proficient it the art.
In the course of ten years that I played my part in
the drama, I earned more by occasionally fabricating a
wig, for the trade, than ever I gained by the stage, spite
of my superior abilities .
The ingratitude and meanness of managers, at length
disgusted me with a profession, I had in the beginning,
thought so highly of , so having obtained the good will of
my little shop, by the interest of some friends, Ijoyfully
established myself in this village, where I have reigned
as first rate hair dresser, without a rival, for the last fif-
teen years . Old Juliette has been my cook, friend and
steady companion ; her tender care of me, I am just
thinking about rewarding by marriage.
My mistress thanked the barber, for the trouble he
hadtaken. Several glasses ofexcellent wine whichmy

master presented to Jacques Tracasse, so enlived the
goodman , that he grew irresistibly entertaining.
After relating various little anecdotes of the inhabit-
ants of Versailles, he continued thus : but ladies, my
best story is to come, only, in the name of Heaven, don't
betray me -its a secret the very best joke ! Oh ! its
delicious !!
Give it us then, quickly, you provoking man, exclaim-
ed my mistress, impatiently.
Youmust know then, said the barber rubbing his hands
gleefully, you must know that. ....
Oh ! how you will
laugh ! -I had it from the very best authority ! -You
must excuse names ! but as to facts , sweet ladies, you
may take Jacques Tracasse's word for them. A lady
of Varsailles, of high birth and character, fell desperately
in love with an officer, about a fortnight ago. He was
aFrenchman ! I need not add, that he was at her ser-
vice. The difficulty was this ; her stupid jealous hus-
band never left her for an instant. No matter, she re-
solved to gratify her passion ...... Listen ladies 'tis
the merriest farce ! would make an excellent dramatic
piece. The lady's waiting woman concealed her lover
in acloset down stairs, after he had been dining at the
house. The husband and his wife, having retired to-
gether to bed, the husband, as often happens, soon fell
asleep. Suddenly, the barber continued, riggling his
chair towards the ladies, and winking his merry eyes,
suddenly the wife made believe to be seized with a vio-
lent pain about the lower stomach ; imaginez vous.
The husband, who awoke from the noise of her continu-
al groans, expressed much anxiety.
It is nothing , my dear , said the tender spouse, .....
but... Iwish to retire, I must go down stairs !
Shall I accompany you ? enquired the husband.
Nomylove, not for the world ; .....but I am dred-
fully afraid of ghosts, will you oblige me by laying hold
of the bell, and ringing it all the while I am absent, that
Imayknowyou are awake. The bell will be company
CLARA GAZUL. 77
for me, at this solemn hour of the night, so don't refuse
me my sweet, since I am so very ill.
The husband agreed. Down went the wife, and in
a second, was in the arms of her lover.
Tingle, tingle, tingle, tingle, went the bell for nearly
three quarter's of an hour, while the happy lovers, se-
cure of the good husband's " whereabouts"-Hem-
translation from Shakepeare's play of Macbeth -enjoy-
ed each other's society, without fear or constraint. Ha!
ha ! ha ! cette invention ! les dames sont uniques pour
inventer, les scenes dramatiques.
Jacques Tracasse, was so taken up with his own
story, that he did not observe the impression it made on
his auditors, till the husband strided past him towards
the street door, and left the house ; at the same instant,
that my mistress fell back on the sofa in a fainting fit.
The dismayed barber, when it was too late, guessed
the truth, and lamented the mischief he had innocently
committed. He bustled up and down, fanned my mis-
tress's face, with his little three cornered hat, whiped
thedrops from his own with his Swiss pocket handker-
chief declared it was a scene for the drama, up coup de
Theatre : and then departed, with uplifted eyes, mut-
teringwondrous ! curious ! who would have thought it ?
For my part, as I was morrally certain, that my mas-
ter would dismiss me for the part I had acted, I began
quietly to pack up my clothes as soon as my mistress
came out of her swoon, and having demanded the pay-
ment of mywages, Ileft Versailles, on that very evening.
Mymaster, as I have since heard, never returned to
his home, but had regular articles of separation drawn
out, which procured for my mistress full liberty of action
without the noise of bells in her ears.
At this moment the loud snoaring ofPauline, who had
fallen asleep in the corner of the carriage, so offended
the little repasseus that she vowed she would waste no
more time in relating pleasant adventures to persons
whohad not the good taste orthe good breeding to lis-
ten to them.

WE ARRIVE AT NAPLES-MY CONQUESTS -JEALOSY IN
HIGH LIFE-NEW FRIENDS.
In a few days after Fanchette had related these ad-
ventures, we arrived at Naples, and as soon as we were
comfortably settled, in an elegant hotel, which the count
hiredby the month, he sent his letter of introduction to
the Marquis St. Betise by the little repassuse.
The next day while Rosa and myself were singing a
duet together, the Marquis was announced. Alittle dry
yellow looking man with fine eyes, of abought eight and
thirty. He was all over diamonds, perfume, and emer-
alds ; the rings on his fingers dazzled us ; his massive
* gold snuff box, was curiously wrought ; his cambric
shirt beautifuly embroidered, and fastened down the
breast with a row of diamond button's. His whole ap-
pearance was that of an Italian nobleman.
Havingsaluted us with studied grace, and expressed
himself charmed to make our acquaintance, and grate-
ful for the vast kindness we had done him in bringing
over such an excellent repasseuse qui plisoit à ravir*,
said the Marquis, kissing the tips of his delicate fingers .
He then hesitated begged mille et mille par-
dons ..... but he had heard such sounds ! -Was it
really a simple guitar that he heard ? (and he cast an
eager glance towards my instrument , which lay on the
table.)
" You are very musical Monsieur le Marquis, " said
the Count, " and will probably like to hear Mademoi-
selle Clara's performance."
" Monsieur le Marquis, " said he, " should be ravi on
ne peut plus. "
Itook up my instrument, and bowing to the Marquis,
began to play a solo in my best style.

The Marquis's demonstrations of delight were so ri-
diculously exagerated, that I with difficulty refrained
from laughing, Bravo ! Bravo! c'est ca. -Oh, deli-
cieuse, Tantini is a fool to you-Oh, Tantini may be
hanged .
" Figurez vous Mademoiselle," said the Marquis , as
soon as I had finished my song, " Figurez vous que je

de moi habituellement et partout. -Sur ma parole d'hon-

strangers , and have not the advantage ofknowing Tan-
tini, I will bring him to you si cela peut vous faire plasir,

woman, and will be charmed with her acquaintance. "
After having chatted an hour and fixed a day, for our
dining at his castello, the Marquis took his leave of us.
The Count having brought various introductory let-
ters, we shortly afterwards received cards from all the
best families in Naples, and in the course of two months,
I made several conquests.
The Signor Roderigo, a rich superannuatednobleman,
was struck through his spectacles , one night, on seeing
me dance a Spanish castagnette dance at the house of
the Marchioness St. Betise ; and here I must mention
the great beauty of my charming countrywoman the la-
dy St. Betise, whose apparent modesty and dignified
reserve inspired me with the highest respect forher
virtue.
She recieved me with distinguished politeness, and
after we had been acquainted a few weeks, often hinted
to me how happy she should feel if I would become her
inmate.
It was in this hospitable mansion, as I have before
said, that I touched the heart of the Signor Roderigo,

tlemanof the name ofDelford, to whomI frankly rela-
ted my adventures, without concealing mypassion for
Ligonia . From being the most ardent lover, he became my
sincere friend, and I parted from him with regret : some
months afterwards, when his health (which had required
Italian skies and air to restore) permitted him to return
to England. One evening as I sat chattering with my
old superannuated admirer, the Signor Roderigo, with-
out observing that the Countess had left us tête-à-tête,
was seized with a fit of heroics, and dropping on his
knees, began a rapturous declaration in the midst of
which, he was surprized by the entrance of the lovely
Marchesa St. Betise, accompanied by her uncle the
Cardinal Poco-puranti.
I blushed deeply, but I could not help laughing.
The Cardinal Poco-puranti's character stood high as
aprelate in Italy, spite of and in defiance of a certain
sly expression which lurked in his eye, and reminded me
of a cautious voluptuary.
His sudden appearance had such a violent effect on
myantique lover, that he fell prostrate backwards. The
beautiful Marchesa assisted me to place my noble con-
quest on his legs again, who, now with shrugs and bows
innumerable, paid his respects to the Cardinal and his
niece.
His Eminence condescended to put many questions
tome on the subject of my religious belief . "Alas !
poor child," said he, after I had frankly explained to him
all I had been taught, " you walk in darkness ; but, my
niece has interested me in your behalf . "
I was eager to change the subject, because I had
lately been induced by the instructions of my young
English admirer, to entertain a strong predilection in fa-
vor of the protestantbelief . Rosa soonjoined us, when
the conversation took a general turn.
" Thank Heavens ! they are gone," said Rosa, as
soon as the Cardinal and his niece had taken their des
CLARA GAZUL. 81
parture , adding , " I have taken such a disgust to that
Cardinal , that I never was in such ahumour to quarrel
withbigots. Listen to me Clara, " she continued, " you
have met the Countess Lorenza, that pious lookingwid-
ow, who always wears black and attends mass three
times aday . "
I have seen her at the Marchesa de St. Betise, I re-
plied .
" The same, " said the Countess ; "last night she
continued, " as I sat watching at my window for the re-
turn of my husband, who dined with one of the minis-
ters, I observed a figure coming along the street, which
I believed to be the Count. As it past the castello of
the Countess de Lorenza, which is to be seen from my
window on amoonlight night, a short figure issued from
the portico in a hood and cloak ; I guessed it to be that
of a female ; it seemed to arrest the steps of the tall fig-
ure by laying hold of his cloak , and having spoken in
his ear , I thought it slipped a letter into his hand.
" It was the Count!
" I was almost speechless when he entered the room
from agitation. " "What can be the matter with you?" said he.
"Having explained what I had seen, I insisted on his
showing me the letter, which was at length reluctantly
handed to me ; I will read you the contents.
The letter ran thus : -
"Charming stranger , -I can no longer resist the pas-
sion with which you have inspired me ; the bearer will
meet you to-morrow evening at nine o'clock, and con-
duct you by the small grey lattice entrance along the
garden to my secret chamber, where I will receive you
intotal darkness, you shall not once hear the sound of
my voice ; for know, too charming stranger, that I val-
ue reputation more than life. The bearer of this note
is completely in mypower, nor shall you ever be able
to prove mydishonor to the world. Be punctual, and
the mystery shall but add rest to our stolen happiness."

"Canthis epistle be writtenby the Signora Lorenza?
Ienquired in the greatest astonishment. "
" It is the hand-writing no doubt of her minion, the
duenna, " replied Rosa, " adding that she was deter-
mined to play her a trick. " The Count, continued she,
" is to dine with the Marquis de St. Betise, I will plead
indisposition as an excuse for remaining at home, I am
tall , and in my husband's clothes, wrapped up in his
largemantle, I caneasily pass myselfon the old duenna. "
Rosa's plan succeeded ; the Count left her at liberty,
and in about an hour after, Rosa in the disguise of her
husband had followed love's messenger to the dark
chamber of the longing fair one. She returned in safe-
ty and amused me with the following account.- " The
old duenna," said Rosa, " desired me to take off my
shoes, that we might pace along the corroder with noise-
less steps. When we arrived at the door, my guide
tapped gently, and we were immediately admitted into
a room so dark, that I required the hand of the duenna
to lead me towards a bed.
" She then whispered in the ear ofsome one who put
forth her hand to welcome me, and drew me gently
towards her.

mine, she was seized with a violent tremor .. ..
then
hastily passing the back of her hand over my face, vain-
ly searching for either my beard or mustache, she seem-
ed ready to give up the ghost, feeling certain that she
was betrayed.
She touched a silver bell which was immediately an-
swered by her watchful duenna.
" Leave the room villain, whoever you are," said
the Signora, " or I will alarm the house ! "
"Not till you have shewn me your face, chaste fair
one, " said I, at the same time seizing hold of the duen-
na's dark lanthorn, and turning its shade round till it
emitted a bright ray of light.

" The Countess Drognichieff !!!" exclaimed the
prude and then fell into hysterics.
"Whythou purblind, mercury, " said I, betweenbursts
of laughter, addressing myself to the duenna; " thou

hypocrite, thy mistress ! Art thou so recently in her ser-

## Chapter IX.
I LEAVE ROSA AND GO TO LIVE WITH THE FAMILY OF
POCO-PURANTI -A DINNER-PARTY-THE COUNTESS
DIABLO-A FAUX- PAS SUSPECTED IN HIGH LIFE .
DURING the rest of the winter which I passed with
the Countess Drognichieff , nothing very remarkable oc-
curred.
The nuptials of my nurse Agnes and Albert were fix-
ed for the following month, which circumstance so en-
raged Rosa's woman Pauline, that she abruptly quitted
her service.
I proposed that Agnes should supply the place of
Pauline about the person of Rosa, who determined to
return to Lyons for her accouchement.
Suspecting that lady of a general disposition to jeal-
ousy, I resolved for the sake of her peace of mind to de-
cline accompanying her, as I guessed she dreaded the
frequent tetes-a-tete which might occur with the Count
andmyselfduring her confinement.
Rosa but faintly attempted to dissuade me, and find-
ing me resolute, “ It happens very lucky, " said she,
"since you are determined to remain in Italy , that I
know of a family, of the highest respectability who de-
sires you to become their inmate.
" The Cardinal Poco-puranti resides with his maiden
sister, in the most splendid palace in all Naples. The
Cardinal is lately appointed by her deceased parent,
guardian to anoble young lady, the affinanced bride of
aCastilian nobleman, now on his travels."
"Theyounglady , Mademoiselle, Laura, being adis-
tant relation of the Cardinals', was sent to them that she
might be prepared for her communion. The Cardinal's
sister, theSignora Poco-puranti, seeks an amiable young
1
CLARA GAZUL. 86
ladyas companion for Laura ,during her residence with
them. "
I made no objections to this proposal, although I had
taken a sort ofdislike to the expression of the Cardinal's
features. Accordingly the next day, we waited on the
Marchesa St. Betise who presented me to her aunt, the
good-natured Signora Poco-puranti, as a young person
highly recommmended, and desirous of offering myself
to be the companion of their ward, Mademoiselle Lau-
ra.
The Signora immediately engaged me. Having in-
vited us into the next room, and presented me to her
pretty ward, who sat playing on her harp, that young la-
dy appeared so elated at the idea ofhaving a companion
of her own age, and expressed so much impatience to
see me regularly installed, that Rosa, to oblige the Sig-
nora Poco-puranti, suffered me to remain from that
hour; promising to send my clothes by Agnes, and to
visit me as long as she should remain in Naples ; she
soon aftewards took her leave.
The Signora Poco-puranti having left me alone with
Laura, we were soon on the most intimate footing.
"How delightful to have a young companion, " said
she, " after having for months been living with these
pious people. What do you think of the Cardinal,
Miss Clara ?"
I unwillingly admitted that his Eminence was hand-
some.
The person of the Cardinal Poco-puranti was never-
theless among the finest order offine forms ; Of ma-
jestic height, with full chest , and if his ebon- point had
began slightly to encroach on the perfect symmetry for
which in his younger days he had been so justly admir-
ed , yet his ancles, feet, and hands would still have furn-
ished fine models for the sculptor's art. His forehead
was high , his skin florid, his nose roman, and if in his
pale blue eye there lurked the expression ofsly volup-
tuousness, his mouthhad acharacter about it both dis-
86 CLARA GAZUL.
tinguished and manly, while nothing could exceed the
brilliant beauty of his teeth.
He passed for a man of tolerable sanctity, yet was
he the Cardinal a la mode at Naples, and esteemed
above all things amongst the ladies, with the exception
of a few old devotees who blamed his love of expence
and courtly phrases, whilst they lamented the pious par-
simonious crooked-backed little Cardinal whom he had
succeeded. But these grumbling souls were few in
number, and bore no comparison to the admirers of
Cardinal Poco-puranti. His Eminence possessed a
certain eloquence both of voice and manner, which was
particularly popular and persuasive.
He was a man ofsound learning too, gentle and easy
in his temper, and he threw his money right and left
among the lazaronies with princely magnificence. Who
would be severe on the qualities of the heart, or exam-
ine too closely into the motive or ruling principles of
such an amiable individual as the gay Cardinal Poco-
puranti ?
I enquired his age ?
Laura guessed it might be five and thirty, or more ;
she spoke of her intended marriage with the Castilian
nobleman with the greatest possible indifference. The
match, she said, had been arranged by her parents as
soon as she was born. Our conversation was interrupt-
ed by the sound of the large dinner-bell, when amagni-
ficent banquet was served up in a beautiful saloon, the
floor of which was inlaid with pure mosaic stone.
The company assembled atdinner , consisted ofRosa
and her husband, the Marquis and Marchioness of St.
Betise, and the Marquis's aunt , the gay old Contessa
Diablo, who was excellent company and made us all
laugh with accounts of her former beauty and conquests.
At this period , painted up to the eyes, her cheeks
covered with black patches, her costume in the fashion
of times long gone bye, her robe of red satin that stood
alone , slashedwith black , and trimmed with point lace ,
CLARA GAZUL. 87
her extraordinary head-dress, her enormous fan, on
which was curiously wrought the figure of Tasso the
poet, in red velvet slashed breeches, kneeling at the
feet of a damsel as stiff as himself , who was crowning
him with awreath of laurels, I say, the old Contessa
Diablo with her patches, lappets, fan , and mittens, was
the most grotesque figure in nature. The Cardinal
saying grace, and the Cardinal during dinner was two
persons. Nothing could be more solemn and impressive than
his tone and manner of calling down a blessing on our
repast, but that ceremony over, the Cardinal was almost
abon vivant; he was certainly an epicure. His great
tact, it seemed to me was, in choosing at all times for
his subject of conversation, something that should be in-
telligible and amusing, not only to the persons to whom
he particularly addressed himself , but also to each and
every individual at his table. And it was curious to ob-
serve how ncar, how very near his Eminence would
sometimes touch on subjects irrelevant, too light, and
too profligate for his pretended sanctity; and yet had
he the tact to wave them in good time,just when he had
roused and excited an interest in the breast of such fair
ladies as liked notthe too rigid morals ofhandsome men.
The freedom of the Contessa Diablo's discourse oft-
en occasioned Laura and myself to blush , while the
modesty of the lovely Marchesa St. Betise, appeared
to suffer even more than ours . She begged and im-
plored, with tears in her beautiful eyes, that the Contes-
sa, her aunt, would change her subject, but the incorri-
gible merry old lady scorned restraint.
"Never tell me never tell me, " said she, in answer
to her niece's expostulations, "there was more candour
in my time. I was a pretty blossom like yourselfonce,
and as pure as snow, up to the hour when the divine
Signor Roderigo, saved my life, at the risk of his own,
by plunging into a muddy pond, where I had fallen,
without taking time to throw off his embroidered cloak
ofpaleblue satin or his ...."
88 CLARA GAZUL.
"Are you alluding toClara's poor oldshrivelled beau,
or some otherRoderigo pray?" interruptedRosa, laugh-
ing . "Aye! aye! aye! aye! " said the Contessa, " the same,
we shall all of usbe shrivelled in time ; even this bloom-
ing little bird, Clara , who now presumes to despise the
first toucher of my virgin heart. Aye! aye! laugh and
gigle if you will, but there was not in all Naples so
graceful a couple, or one whodanced aminuet or ga-
votte halfso well, as dear Roderigo and myself."
" Nephew St. Betise, send me a glass ofthat musca-
do wine, at your elbow, and let us drink to his health
and longevity. I was neverunfaithful to him but once. "
" Hush! hush ", said the Cardinal, half seriously.
"I earnestly implore you to consider, dear Contessa,
these two very young ladies," alluding to Laura and
myself , " consider the sacred trust reposed in me. I
am ready, " continued the Cardinal, smiling gracefully,
" to wave all claim to such deference and respect as
may be due to my red hat, and episcopal dignity : but
I implore you good Contessa Diablo, consider mypro-
tegees; consider the Marchesa St. Betise my lovely
timid niece. "
"Bah! bah! bah! about your timid niece, " replied
the old lady , shrugging up her shoulders, and regarding
the youngMarchesa with a grotesque expression of
irony . The young Marchesa fixed her modest eyes on the
table cloth, and was silent.
"Well, then," said the polite Cardinal, in his zeal to
preservedecorum, without losing sight of hospitality,
"desist from this light discourse dear Contessa, for my
sake, who ambound by my sacred vow, yet am, alas,
but aman , in the presence of some of the fairest and
noblest dames in Naples. "
" The Cardinal is complaining to me ladies, " said
the Contessa , whose noddle was beginning to warm
withthejuice of the Tuscan grape- "the pious Cardi-
CLARA GAZUL. 89
nal has been complaining to me that his manhood suf-
fers somewhat in our fair presence. "
This remark caused a tear to tremble in the bright
eye of the Marchesa ; Laura and I smiled on each other,
without quite understanding it.
The Marquis de St. Betise, in pity to his timid wife,
changed the conversation to that eternal theme of his
music, and the Signor Tantini.
Methought the cardinal, though polite to all his guests
was more than usually attentive to his young ward, who
appeared delighted when he addressed her.
After dinner, amagnificent suit ofrooms were thrown
open, and the arrival of the celebrated Tantini put the
Marquis St. Betise, into an extacy ofdelight. Tanti-
ni's handsome melancholy countenance, inspired the be-
holders with pity, because of the degrading sacrifice
which had been inflicted onhim in his youth, for the im-
provement of his voice, according to the fashion of italy .
At the entreaty of the Marquis I sang a duet with
Tantini from a popular opera, and was applauded more
than ever I was in Spain. Rosa sang very pleasantly,
the old Contessa gave us her song too, the chorus of
which was something about her regrets for the time
gonebye, her round arm, and swelling bosom.
The Marchesa laid her little hand upon her aunt's lip.
"Enough ! enough ! dear Contessa, " said she be-
seechingly- " Dans majeunesse j'ai fait comme ma
grande tante, et toi, tu peux faire comme moi, "* replied
the old lady, in her niece's ear.
" Chantons ! Chantons !" said the Marquis de St.
Betise.
Laura and myself retired early to rest.
Rosa departed for Lyons shortly after I had taken
up myabode with the lady Poco-puranti, accompanied
by mynurseAgnes.

The kind creature seeing herselfabout to be separa-
ted from me for the first timein her life, was greatly dis-
tressed, but I knew she loved her husband Albert too
dearly to part with him without deep regret, I therefore
insisted, and took leave of her with a heavy heart.
The ladyPoco- puranti ever treated me with kindness.
They lived in a style of princely magnificence, and
were visited by the best society in Naples.
When I had been with them about three months, I
was struck with the change in Laura's manner and ap-
pearance . She became subject to violent nausea of the
stomach, her eyes were continuallyred and swollen, her
appetite felloff , yet her en- bon- point increased. It was
in fact, impossible for me to drive away certain suspi-
cions injurious to her character.
The subject was too delicate to question Laura about
whose reserve towards me became almost haughty, the
momentshe observedcurious anxiety of me countenance.
Of ancient descent, Laura was proud and high minded.
I hoped I was mistaken, for she never left the palace,
or was for an instant alone. With whom, therefore,
could she have formed any criminal intercourse ,

A BLUNDER - A HANDSOME PAGE IN LOVE .
As I sat musing on this subject, the Signora Poco-
puranti's little fancifully equipped page, tapped at my
door, and was desired to enter. He bowed gracefully,
and begged leave to present me with a bouquet which
he had just gathered. " Signora, " said he to me, “ I
heardyou say yesterday ,that you were fond offlowers,
particularly the helitrope, and I have fancied they might
be acceptable."
' The boy's voice was sweet and plaintive, and there
was an expression of melancholy in his handsome face,
which rendered it interesting beyond description.
Eugenio's, for such was the page's name , counte-
nance was congenial with his native sky ; its softness
formed a touching contrast to that characteristic ardor .
which beams passionfrom the bright eyes of aSpaniard.
If ever I read love in the eyes of mortal, this boy was
in love. Here then was the mystery unravelied ? here
was Laura's excuse ; for who could be altogether indif-
ferent to the tender pleadings ofsuch a lovely counte-
nance ?
These ideas passed rapidly through my brain, and be-
fore Eugenio had placed his sweet offering in the rich
vases that ornamented a curious marble slab, which stood
between my window, I had acknowledged his galantry
with sincere thanks.
Eugenio, said I, you are, I am told, a great botanist.
" One must study something, " he replied, with agen-
tlesigh.
Are your parents living Eugenio ?
" Have you not heard Miss Clara that I was found in
abasket, fastened to the gates of this palace, fifteen
years ago, for this is my birth day. "
92 CLARA GAZUL.
Poor Eugenio ! andwhat are your future plans ?
"My future plans ?" said the youth, fixing his soft
darkblue eyes intensely on my face, and then dropped
their black fringes towards the earth. ....
There was
something in his ardent glance that tinged my cheek
with crimson.
" I have formed no projects or plans for the future
latterly ," said Eugenio, " for my mind has been occu-
pied by desires and visions of happiness, which may
never be gratified."
And yet Eugenio, said I, smiling, were one to judge
of the state of your mind and heart, by your dress, one
would suppose you the gayest of the gay. What des-
pondingyouth ever sported such gay colours ? That
blue vest how becomingly is it fastened ; those cambric
sleeves, how white and delicately plaited ; that sash so
elegantly tied, and those dark curls how fragrant with
perfume ! Is this the livery of despair Eugenio ?
"I will stand hereno longer to be laughed at, " retort-
ed the handsome page archly, while seating himself in a
chair, which stood close to mine .... yet did Eugenio
possess more modesty than pages in general, although
not enough to believe that there were many of the other
sex who could look on him with aversion, or be un-
charitably severe on his faults.
"It is the wish of the Lady Poco-puranti, that I dress
with taste and elegance, " said the page, as soon as he
had seated himself..
But, Eugenio, I replied, you were not always so much
inclined to obedience as now, I have been told you are
in love, that is the truth of it ; I can read it in the soft
expression of your eyes -I hear it in the melancholy
tones of yourlute -you tremble, Eugenio, I have guess-
ed right , and you are too handsome to love in vain.

youth, whoblushing deeply, stammered out ingreatcon.

True I am not much older than yourself but I have
seen more of the world, and can read your heart, Euge-
nio, Your love was irresistible in the heart of the un-
fortunate lovely girl, whose affections you have seduced.
" You astonish me, Miss Clara ! No doubt , as you
say, you are but too lovely, but with regard to my hav-
ing seduced your affections -I declare, I ....”
My affections !! -What are you talking about Eu-
genio ? What can you mean ?
"And is it possible, Clara ," said the page, growing
boldby an effort, aided by a glance at the large mirror
which reflected at full length his very graceful person ;
" can it be possible you do not read my heart ? and can
you suspect me of loving another ? "
The boy fixed his bright blue eyes tenderly on my
face .
What, do you really mean to say you are in love with
me pretty Eugenio ? I asked, blushing and laughing.
"My height is five feet eight, " said the youth, with
something of indignation, " said the youth, with some-
thing of indignation, "and young as I am, there will
never be a period of my existence when I shall love
with the same ardour and purity" .... " Clara," he
continued, " I intreat you do not vex me ; I would sa-
crifice a thousand times my life for you ; I have said
my prayers to you, I have loved you as my divinity
from the first hour that I beheld you; both of us are de-
prived of our parents, let us love, and never forsake
each other."
Eugenio, I replied, I have no heart to bestow.
The page's sunny face was now bathed in tears which
he hastily brushed away with one of his bright curls.
"You despise the poorpage then, said he, proudly ;
yet is there good blood in my veins ; my father is a
greatman , I will not disgrace his name or high cour-
age. " You know your father then, Eugenio.

"Byname, as I am informed by my mother youwould
not ask me to betray my parent's, secrets, " continued
Eugenio.
No ! indeed, dear Eugenio, I replied -I would be
as a kind sister to you and love you as mybrother.
" But you love another, Clara !"
One, Eugenio to whom I may never see again. I
then related to the amiable boy, the whole history of my
life. To my great astonishment Eugenio assured me
heknew Ligonia, whose self -devotion to the cause he
undertook, and brilliant qualities he spoke of with en-
thusiastic admiration. We will be the very friends all
ourlives, said I, holding out my hand to the page, who
covered it with ardent kisses .
Some one tapped at the door.

## Chapter XI. PRIVATE THEATRICALS-AN ELOPEMENT.
### Page 96

It was the Marchesa de St. Betise; her modest eyes glanced on the page with shy, but unequivocal admiration.

Her ladyship brought me a ticket for a magnificent masked ball, which she proposed giving the following month, in honor of her husband's birth day; "come down stairs and obtain the permission of the lady Poco-puranti, for yourself and Laura," said the Marchesa.

The Marchioness proposed getting up the performance of that classical piece Telemachus, in which figured, according to the Italian composition, Cupid, Psyche, Bacchus, all the Graces, Muses, Furies, &c. &c.

The piece had already been ably performed at the private theatre of their palazzo, which was beautifully decorated and adorned; since which, Psyche was in a decline; Cupid had taken a trip to England, Bacchus to the Pays de Vaud, the Muses were scattered all over France, jostling each other in every town; in fact, Paris had turned out such common women, that no one cared to patronize them, and Mentor was dead and buried.

To be brief, the old company was dispersed, and the Marchesa expressed her anxiety to form a new one.

The young Prince Orazio, whose beauty and talents rang through Naples, had undertaken the part of Telemachus, as the Marchesa informed us, whilst her ladyship chose that of the nymph Eucharis. I was intreated to play Calypso, and the characters were all cast and arranged by the following evening.

When the Machesa had taken her leave of us, after

appointing anearly day for our first rehearsal at her palazzo, the Signora Poco-puranti called me into her closet , and related to me with tears in her eyes, her suspicions as to Laura's state of health, which exactly cor-
responded with my own.
She implored meto speak to Laura on the subject,
remarking, that the poorgirl would be more inclined to
openher mind to a companion of her own age.
I replied, that I had already vainly endeavoured to
draw Laura into conversation, which might lead to the
subject of her altered health and appearance.
" After all," said the good Signora, " we may be
mistaken ; how is it possible that this child can be preg-
nant ? Who does she see ? Has she been once absent
alone, or shown the slightest preference towards any
one of our male visitors : were it possible to suspect
the page Eugenio of so dishonorable a crime, I would
spurn him from my presence ; but it cannot be, Euge-
nio's heart is pure, his mind is noble, andhe is always
occupied in deep study ."
I assured the Lady Poco- puranti of my belief that
her page was innocent of any crime against the peace
and honor of her ward, and I promised to make one
more attempt to induce that young lady to open her
heart to me.
Vain , however, were all my efforts for that purpose.
Laura confessed that something had destroyed her
peace, and she thought change of scene would be of
service to her ; she had, therefore, she said, written to
her brother to entreat him to take her to his house at
Florence; but she begged me not to question her on
the subject of her grief , as she had determinedto con-
ceal the cause of it for ever in herownbreast. Do not,
continued Laura, touch upon this subject again. Lau-
ra's face was bathed in tears, andher poor heart seem-
edheavily oppressed . Sincerely did I sympathise in
her suffering, andpressing her in my arms, Imingled
mytears with hers.
CLARA GAZUL. 97
The Signora Poco-puranti, on learning the result of
our conversation, rejoiced that her interesting ward
would soon be under the protection of her brother who
was the friend and companion of the Castilian nobleman
to whom Laura was betrothed.
On the day fixed by the Marchesa St. Betise for our
first rehearsal, poor Laura refused to accompany us, on
the plea ofhead-ache.
this
At this rehearsal I met for the first time the handsome
and youthful Prince Orazio, of whom I had heard such
frequent and favorable mention. His Highness having
been invited by the Marchesa to take the part of Tele-
machus, was charmed with the proposal, and evinced
much talent in the course of this rehearsal ; I was also
surprised to observe, how ably the Marchesa St. Betise
performed her part ; hitherto she had not evinced any
extraordinary talent in conversation, yet she seemed
now to possess qualities to make a finished actress ;
above all, she could throw what expression she pleased
into her beautiful features, and was particularly happy
in her delineation of the tender passion displayed by the
nymph Eucharis for Telemachus. With what ardent
glances of love did she regard the young Prince ! How
sweet and tremulous were the tones of her voice when
kneeling before the alter of love, she vowed eternal
truth to her lover.
And then to see the fire that glowed in the eyes of
young Orazio ! How he lingered in her embrace ! How
his eloquent blood mounted to his cheek when his arm
clasped the delicate yielding waist of the lovely Marche-
sa.
Surely, me thought, these are the best actors in Na-
ples ; it is nature itself ! who would not be carried

The audiance assembled to witness this rehearsal,
didme the honor to say many flattering things of my
performance at Calypso.
We dined at the Palazzo of the Marquis St. Betise,
and it was late in the evening when we returned home
delighted with our kind hosts.
Wefound the domestics of the palace ofPoco-puranti
in the greatest confusion and consternation. Miss Lau-
rawas no where to be found ; aletter was lying upon
her dressing-table, sealed and directed to the Lady Po-
co-puranti ; hastily tearing it open she read asfollows.-
" I humbly thank you my dear Lady for the kind at-
"tention you have ever shewn towards me, although it
"has bsen my heaviest misfortune to have ever entered
" yourdoors.
" Feelings, I am not at liberty to describe, rendered

## Chapter XII - A MASQUERADE.
The news beingthus confirmed of Laura's elopement ,
the Cardinal seemed greatly moved, and actually was
seen to shed tears .
It was the general opinion that she had fled with her
seducer, but no one could guess who that seducer could
be. Eugenio, the page, expressed his unfeigned regret
so naturally, that it was impossible to suspect him, at
the tender age of fifteen, of such deep deception.
The Cardinal wrote to Laura's brother at Florence,
to express his deep regret at what had occurred. Cour-
iers were dispatched right and left, but none overtook
Laura. At length the feelings of the Cardinal's family
were much relieved by the receipt of the following letter
from Laura's brother.
" The Count de L F has the honor to in-
"form his Eminence, the Cardinal Poco-puranti, that
" his sister, the Signora Laura, is under his immediate
" protection, also that the Cardinal's family have labour-
"ed under the most extraordinary mistake as to their
"ungrounded suspicions touching the honor and charac-
" ter of his sister, who has entirely recovered from her
" late indisposition.
"The Countde L F."
Neither the Cardinal or his sister appeared to place
implicit faith in this assurance of Laura's brother, touch-
ing the innocence of his sister. Appearances were too
strikingly evident against that unfortunate young lady,
who had endeared herself to all the members of the
Cardinal's family, by the sweetness of her disposition.
100 CLARA GAZUL
Having been engaged by the lady Poco-puranti as
companion to her ward, I now proposed seeking a new
situation, but the kind lady entreated me to continue
with her, until she had in some degree recovered the
shock of the late elopement.
Our frequent rehearsals, however, had not been inter-
rupted by poor Laura's misfortunes, and on the night
appointedfor the masquerade, the streets of Naples were
at an early hour, almost blocked up by strings of ele
gant équipages filled with masked characters, some gro-
tesque, others sentimental.
The Italians are the only people in the world for mas-
querading. The beautiful gardens belonging to the no-
ble palace of St. Betise were illuminated with millions
of variegated lamps ; groups ofmusicians wandered up
and down the groves, and among the trees were heard
the sound of various instruments as they moved along,
flutes, cymbals, clarionettes , tambourines, &c. &c.
The Marquis, who superintended all the bands, was
in his glory, running here and there counting and beating
time every where. There was Euterpe personified by
the gay Marquise de la Croix, ofwhomit will be remem-
bered the little repasseuse related an anecdote. She
presided over a group of lovely nymphs, who were to
execute on twelve harps the Marquis of St. Betise's
new composition, which had cost him three years labour.
It was late in the evening when a set of bells rang
merrily to summon all this gay assembly to the theatre,
to witness our performance of Telemachus. Instead
of an overture , such as is usually performed previous to
an opera, the rising of the curtain discovered the twelve
lovely nymphs with Euterpe as their leader, who ably
struck the chords of their well strung harps to do honor
to the laborious composition of their noble host. The
music had no sooner ceased than the rich scene repre-
sented the shipwreck of Telemachus and Mentor. The
young and graceful Prince Orazio, who played this he-
ro, wore a most splendid dress, and charmed the whole
CLARA GAZUL. 101
of the audience by his beauty and excellent perform-
ance. Never yet had I seen such acting ! so true to
nature, so impassioned !
The Prince's enthusiasm was for the moment sym-
pathetic. I felt the passion of love in my very soul, and
as Calypso, I had reason to believe I did not disgrace
my mother's celebrity as an actress. The piece con-
cluded amidst the loud plaudits of the well-disposed as-
sembly. Then commenced the merry mazy dance. The va-
riegated tints of many thousand lamps-the sweet flow-
ers that perfumed the air -the groups of lovely females
-their chaste and classical costumes-the harmonious
sound of many harps the gentle breezes that just
caused the leaves of the tall orange trees to tremble and
waft their fragrance around, softly fanning lovers cheeks,
and echoing back their sighs of passion, in murmurs
softer still -all stole upon the delighted senses like en-
chantment.
The Marquis de St. Betise, was seen every where,
the most officious and polite of hosts ; while the Mar-
chesa reclined her delicate frame on a mossy bank, sur-
rounded by her female attendants, whose nymph-like
attire of snowy white, formed a pleasing contrast to the
rich glittering robe of azure blue, worn by our fair hos-
tess , whose pleasure or caprice it was to employ them
thus publicly, to display the extraordinary luxuriance
and profusion of her shining tresses, which they wetted
with sweet essence out of curious vases, and laid in fan-
tastic ringlets about her head and neck.
The bank where this beautiful group of females re-
posed, was artificially arranged in the most picturesque
wild style, and was lighted with still bluish lamps, which
emitted a soft twy- light. The page and myselfproceed-
ed along this bank in a winding direction by a gradual
ascent and arrived at a hermit's cell. It was dimly
lighted by a lamp made out of a human scull. Here
sat an anchorite, whose beard was as white as snow
102 CLARA GAZUL.
His simple garb of iron gray , was fastened round his
waist by a leathern belt . He wore sandals on his feet,
and the upper part of his face was concealed by a scowl.
He sat leaning on his hand, apparently in deep thought :
a large volume lay upon a rude table before him, buthe
seemed to disregard it.
Some high spirited young ladies who represented
flower girls , came gambling and laughing towards the
venerable man, and in burlesque merriment, made their
offering of flowers on their knees, while praying for his
blessing.
The hermit waved his hand impatiently, as if to en-
gage them to depart without uttering a single word.
" Oh ! you hard harted hermit, " said the elder flow-
er girl, how can such an anchorite with this pretty
whitehand,' saying which, she seized hold of the hermit's
right hand, and pushing aside the sleeve of his gown, ex-
hibited for an instant, a very model of hands, moulded
in Nature's finest proportions.
He of the white beard, having snatched away his hand
darted out of the cell, with the swiftness of the rein deer
rather than the tottering of age and infirmity, and had
reached the busy buzzing throng of masks in a second.
" Pursue him ! pursue him ! let him have no rest,"
exclaimed the merry flower girls, hurrying onwards,
towards the spot from whence he disappeared, while the
Page and myselftired of the dumb hermit, proceeded
in a contrary direction towards the centre of the vast
gardens.
" Eugenio ! Eugenio," whispered a soft trembling
voice close behind us ; " dear Eugenio ! let me speak
a word with you in private."
" Most willingly, Madame," replied the page, " but
...." and he paused, making signs to the lady that I
was under his protection.
" Present me to Miss Clara, " said the mask, who
wore a rich purple mantle.
" The Countess de Polignac, my best friend, " said
the page, presenting me.
CLARA GAZUL. 103
The maskheld out her hand -mutual compliments
having passed, we bent our steps to a retired spot, when
the Countess having unmasked for an instant, and dis-
covered a countenance of commanding beauty, spoke
to me as follows :
" Though you now see my face for the first time, I
haveheard much about you from the lady Poco-puranti,
as well as from her protegee, the young Eugenio ; and
I am so prepossessed in your favour, as to have determ-
ined to open my heart to you, urged as I amby peculiar
circumstance's . Will you accept of my friendship, Miss
Clara, and may I expect to enjoy your society to-
morrow , " said the lady, presenting me with her card,
adding, " that she would take upon herself to answer
that lady Poco-puranti, would not oppose her wishes. "
I replied, that in that case, her ladyship might expect
me at an early hour.
" Farewell then, till to-morrow ," said the Countess,
and having pressed the hand of Eugenio with tender
warmth, she left us.
My remarks on the subject of this lady's invitation
were interrupted by the crowd assembled round a merry
pedler, who was exposing his ware, and extolling the
perfection of his drugs and charms of various sorts. By
his side stood a young gipsy girl, whose graceful form
and bright dark eye, attracted general admiration.
Maids, wives, and widows, and many, no doubt, of a
fourth class, which belong to neither of the three, crow-
ded about the young gipsy, and eagerly presented their
plans for her inspection. With timid but arch humour,
the gipsy answered, teased, and vexed them in turn, by
the varied interpretations of the lines in their hands.
When I put mine forward, she fixed her eyes on me
with a singular expression of curiosity ; but mydisguise
which was that of a Spanish nun was complete, andmy
close wax mask defied the most penetrating observer.
At length the gipsy turned her eyes on my hand, but
paused again, as if some doubt remained that she desi-
red to satisfy ,
104 CLARA GAZUL.
Do you know me pretty gipsy ? I asked disguising
my voice.
The gipsy shook her head significantly, when having
studied my palm for a few moments " Heavens de-
fend us, " said she, " what a chequered scene is here
unfolded ! what viscissitudes of grief and joy, and an-
guish ! .... and the worst pang your heart will know
shall be inflicted by a female -I see a scaffold ! .... a
dungeon ! ..... aring ! .... ; prosperity for yourself
and destruction to him you love ! "
Enough, enough, said I, shuddering, for the gipsy's
voice sounded in my ear like that of my evil genius.
Me thought I had somewehere heard such sounds be-
fore, yet where or when I knew not. -Snatching away
my hand, I turned towards her companion and protector
the pedlar, who was delighting the page Eugenio with
his merry discourse.
" Come and buy ; mypretty maidens, come andbuy"
said he. " Here is love powder for your sweethearts
pretty maidens, the true ruby tint for your lips, and top-
knots for your bonnyhair ! here's Doctor Gascony's
book of dreams, and old Dame Ventre-bleu's the wise
woman's receipt for twins, printed on large letters , and
not a hard word in all the book ! here are garters that
have a charm against being crossed in love ! come buy
my lads, buy. Here's a liqueur to try the faith of your
mistresses, come buy it and try it ! 'twill sweeten your
coffee and cheer up your spirits - ' twill floate if they're
virgins, else ' twill sink to the bottom like lead. "
Eugenio and myselfnow endeavoured to retire from
the crowd that was increasing about the pedlar and his
protejee the gipsy ; turning myself round for the pur-
pose of effecting my escape, I came in close contact
with the silent hermit, who contrived to give my hand a
gentlepressure unobserved by one.
" This dumb hermit has been watching us for some
time " said Eugenio- " father will you purchase this ro-
CLARA GAZUL. 105
sary " called out the pedlar to the anchorite, who shook
hishead.
" Our reverned brother was born dumb, " observed a
young friar who passed near us at that instant ,
"Nothe ! not he ! said the gipsy, " siezing hold of his
hand, as he was hurrying past her, " not he indeed ! "
The hermit snatched away his hand, not before the
gipsy had thrown a hasty glance on the lines that mark-
ed it .
" Thou do'st well to conceal the delineation of thy
crimes from my penetration, " observed the gipsy with
a tone ofpiting asperity, such as she had not hitherto
used.
I thought the hermit's whole frame shuddered, but it
might have been fancy. In a second of time, he had
forced his way through the crowd, and was out of sight.
The pedlar rebuked the gipsy for her harshness, but
she only placed her finger on her lips significantly, and
muttered some unintelligible sounds, like one spell-
bound .
Suddenly the hermit again rushed into her presence,
presenting his hand to the sybil, in a faint disguised
voice, said, " I would know what observations your kind-
ness or your malice is disposed to make as to the lines
of my hand, which you profess to interpret. "
" Father," said the gipsy in a tremulous voice the
tone of which again struck me, as familliar to my ear,
" father, neither our antipathies or our predelications are
to be accounted for, or commanded. The touch of your
hand, is like the glance of the basilsk in it's effects upon
my shuddering sens, and I know not why ! .... Away
with you I entreat you I will not again touch your palm . "
The hermit sighed audibly ; -'twas the sigh ofhope-
less despair, and he then vanished.
The pedlar looked on the scence with an appearance
of anxious curiosity, and hastened to lead his protejee
towards a seat where he could converse with her inpri-
vate .

106 CLARA GAZUL.
Wewere shortly afterwards joined by the merry
Countess of Diablo, who was accompanied by her old
friend and ci-devant lover the antiquated but amorous
Count Roderigo.
Bothwere unmasked, the lady wore arich dress of
greenandpointlace, made after the fashion of her youth.
The Countess pressed me inher arms and professed
muchjoy at seeing me. Her nephew, the Marquis de
St. Betise had described my dress to her, and she wish-
edmeto witness her minuet, with Count Roderigo.

"This" continued the old lady, "is the very same dress I wore fifty yearsago at the famous Regent's ball, where I danced the *minuet de la cour* with the then fascinating Roderigo;" the said fascinating object, who by the bye was at this period of time the very image of a baboon, bowed low for the compliment.

"I will go in quest of a fiddler, and if I can't find one I'll fetch my own flute," said the delighted page.

In another second he dragged an unwilling member of the nearest band, fiddle and all towards us, who having scraped his instrument into tune struck up the minuet. Roderigo and the Countess's dance excited bursts of laughter from the crowd that soon gathered around them. It was in fact the most grotesque exhibition that could be imagined, and the good-tempered Countess delighted in the merriment she occasioned. "Ah! ah!
ah! those were happy days Roderigo, " said she, when
the dance was ended, " those were delicious days, when
the pressure of your hand made my heart dance ; ...
but observe, " she continued," the young Prince Orazio
there in conversation with my niece."
The Prince still wore the costume of Telemachus ;
the Marchesa St. Betise seemed to hang on his words
with delight, as they retired together under a thick or-
angegrove.
The Countess Diablo having recommended the page
to go about his business or pleasure, withRoderigo, in-
vited me to accompanyher. As she led the way tow-
CLARA GAZUL, 107
ards the spot to which the Prince and his companion
had retired, I would have remonstrated on the indelica-
cyof our listening to, or interrupting private conversation.
" Bah ! bah ! bah ! said the old lady, " dragging me
along," what do we come to the masquerade for ? -not
to be straight laced, but to enjoy ourselves. I know
that sly niece ofmine ; I saw the melting softness of
her eyes when she addressed that sweet boy. How
delicate are my blushes ! How ardentthe fire that flash-
es from his eyes ! How interesting his youthful modes-
ty .... Oh! ma foi ! were I but twenty, only twenty
years younger !! .. pretty doves !! .. Would not one
say they were made by Nature for each other's happi-
ness ? but hush ! we are approaching."
I would have spoken ; .... I wanted to retire but
the old lady held me in a grasp, which age had not yet
rendered feeble, and placed her other hand on my lips.
" Softly then, " she whispered " we are her friends
..
..
hush ! hush ! the very life and spirit of a masked
ball would be destroyed but for a little intrigue. " In
another second we approached as near as to hear the
sound of their voices, while a large tree, completely
concealed our persons.
The Marchesa spoke in a soft thrilling voice of the
fatigue she had encountered, of her delicate health, of
the music, of any thing but love. The Prince paid her
thehomage that a slave pays to a divinity.
Scarcely fifteen years of age, bred and educated in
the strictest moral feelings, his blood now warmed with
the wildest desires, probably for the first time. He
seemed afraid to breath or sigh, or utter a word, lest the
noble and pure Marchesashould guess at what was pas-
sing in his heart. Perhaps a bolder lover might have
presumed to hope from the unusual softness of the fair
lady's tones, that some degree either of favor or ofpity
had been granted towards him, even hadhe so far trans-
gressed as to have hinted at these ardent feelings, with
which she had evidently inspired him. But the Mar-
.108 CLARA GAZUL.
chesa's lovely lips breathed only the purest sentiments
of virtue. Her rich mantle of blue velvet had been
thrown aside. " The night air, at this late hour, grows
chilly to a Spanish constitution, " said my fair country
woman , languidly attempting with her little hands to
draw the cloak about her, as we could imperfectly ob-
serve from our hiding place.
The young Prince assisted her.
"Are not my hands cold," she inquired in tender ac-
cents. The touch of her hand which she presented,
seemed to produce the effect of magic on theyoung no-
vice , whose voice became tremulous from agitation-
I believe he ventured to press it to his lips . -There was
a pause- " Lady! Marchesa," said he at
length " Have I offended that you are silent ? -Did
you not allow me the honour of pressing your hand, and
could it be resigned e're it had been pressed by my lips
without a deviation from that chivalris gallantry, which
your ladship's presence must naturally inspire ? ....
Still silent lady ? Then am I indeed wretched, for you
are offended ! "
" And for what, dear Prince, " asked the Marchesa
laughing, " why should I be offended with one so truly
amiable ?
" Ha ! Ha ! Ha ?" bawled out the Countess Dia-
blo, advancing from our place of concealmentanddrag-
ging me after her. We have caught the pretty doves.
Oh! the silly things, how must you suffer ! How hard
hearted is virtue ? What would you give to be free from
her restraint at this moment ? Pretty youth ! -modest
boy ! -which ofour sex could long resist you ?" said
the profligate old lady, parting the rich profusion of the
Prince's glossy waving hair.
The Marchesa with soft, but dignified composure,
observed with a smile, " that Madame, the Countess,
her noble aunt, was privileged to say in all societies just
what came intoherfanciful head, without regard to time,
orplace, or truth.
CLARA GAZUL. 109
Chanson ! Chanson ! "* said the old lody, " you were
made for each other, and I defy you to resist your des-
tiny ; hold out as long as you will , I know where it
must end.
The Marchesa now began to look seriously offended
atear trembled in her eye. " How have I deserved
this, what have I said that could deservesuch scandal ? "
she asked with simplicity , either real or very well acted.
The young Prince who was evidently under the influ-
ence of a new passion, which in its first stage was of
that pure and ardent kind that resembles idolatry, ap-
peared to suffer tortures, and dropping on his knees, he
seized the Countess Diablo, by the hand and looked in
her face so beseechingly, that the old lady's heart softened.
" I will not vex you, lovely boy ! arise dear child and
play the fool as much as you please with your exagger-
ated sentiments ; I could not have resisted you in youth
neither can I now. "
The Prince, in the ardor of his youthful enthusiasm,
covered the old lady's hand with kisses.
For my part, I seized the first opportunity to apolo-
gize for my intrusion.
"Enough, Enough, " said the Countess, interrupting
me, and turning to herniece, " I tell you niece, this child
is free from blame, 'twas all my doing. "
" I am not afraid of being surprised, " said the Mar-
chesa, smiling and presenting her hand to me, with dig-
nified politeness. " Miss Clara is not unacquainted
withthe comic humour of my aunt. "
While conversing amicably, we advanced toward a
more public part of the gardens : the first acquaintance
we met was the Marchesa's uncle, the Cardinal Poco-
puranti. He was masked and wore the red hat and full
cardinal's costume ; he appeared in high spirits, and
expressed himself delighted with the variety he had wit

nessed during the evening. In the course of our con-
versation, his Eminence mentioned two new acquain-
tances, which he had just made and called our attention
to two masks in the dark green dominos who stood at a
short distance conversing together.
" They are men of vast erudition, " said the Cardinal
" in short, " so he went on, " I have seldom been more
charmed with the conversation of any individual than
with that of the elder. They have both been great tra-
vellers and were lately in Africa ; I could not resist the
fascination of their discourse, and I have invited these
strangers to dine with me to-morrow. "We can ac-
cept your invitation ," replied the elder stranger, " but
onone condition, namely, that you do not require us to
unmask ; we travel in strict incognito, and we are un-
der a vow, the most solemn to conceal our existence,
during the next two months, at the end of which period
if you will allow us the honor of your acquaintance, we
will remove our masks and fully satisfy you as to who
and what we are. It now remains for you to choose
whether you will admit us to your table to-morrow un-
der all these mysterious circumstances, or frankly re-
fuse us that pleasure, until we can prove ourselves wor-
thy of your confidence, in which latter case we shall
journey forwardto night. "1
I assured them, that though it would be the first time
I had dined with masked gentlemen at my own table,
yet it being the season of the Carnival I had no objec-
tion, and should feel proud of the company of such en-
lightened men, eventhough they refused to shew their
faces. "
The Countess Diablo was violent in her exclama-
tions against receiving strange men , who dared not
shew their faces, adding that her dear nephew was wont
to be more cautious : that in fact, the green dominos
must be fairies, who had bewitched him, or for all she
knew, they might be two robbers.
The cardinal replied that they were the most high
CLARA GAZUL. 111
bredmenhe hadmet with in Naples, that was impossi-
ble to converse with them and mistake them for thieves.
Bigots they might be, who might have made a silly
vow , but the idea of their being robbers was absurd, he
should take them for menof even regal remark from
the suavity and dignity of their manners.
" In spite of all you can say nephew, said the perse-
vering Countess Diablo, " I hope you will invite a
friend to meet them, and be well armed. "
" Bah ! I fear no one," said the Cardinal, “ much
less these elegant intelligent strangers, whose genius
and merits alone induced me to press them to dine with
me. They are coming towards us."
In another instant the green dominos joined us, and
the Cardinal having presented them, the conversation
took a general turn.
Isoon ceased to be surprised at the favourable im-
pression their discourse had made on the Cardinal, for
two reasons ; first, because they conversed with infi-
nate grace and talent , and lastly , because I never heard
a manmoredelicately flattered , and put in good humour
with himself , that the Cardinal by the elder incognito.
An age could not have made him better acquainted
and more competent to administer to Poco-puranti's foi-
bles. There seemed to exist a degree of sympathy in
their tastes and feelings, in their manner of seeing things
which rendered natural and simple, what else had been
mere fulsome flattery, such as his Eminence had too
good sence to have admired.
The same happymedium between the excess of rigid
sanctity, and the ease of worldly profligacy seemed to
exist in the minds of all three gentlemen ; the same
tact and lively turn of thought.
Halfan hour passed quickly in this pleasing society,
when the Cardinal and his friends saluted and left us.
Aswe strolled along, the Countess Diablo noddedand
chatted with almost every mask she met. In the thickest
of thecrowd I know not howit happened, but I sudden-

ly lost sight of her Ladyship. Vexed and ashamed at
finding myselfalone among such a vast concourse of
fashionable persons, I hastened down a long avenue of
orange shrubs searching eagerlyfor some of myac-
quaintances-
Iheard steps close behind me-Turning myhead
round, I saw the silent hermit who advanced, and in a
voice near to be forgotten by me, asked me if I knew
him. It was Ligonia's voice, and its tones thrilled on
my heart.
You here, dear Ligonia ! -dear Sir, said I, correcting
myself , in accents tremulous from delight ?
" Hush," replied Ligonia , for it was indeed himself,
leading me gently to a more retired spot," Particular
business of every private nature called me suddenly to
this country ; passing through Naples this morning on
my road to a distant part of Italy, I waited on my par-
ticular acquaintance the Countess of Polignac. It was
from her I learnt yourresidence with Cardinal Poco-pur-
anti, and also that you would be at this masked ball to
night, in the dress of a Spanish nun. Though I have
long turned my back on the gaieties of the world, yet I
could not resist availing myselfof the only opportunity
Imight have of enquiring after your welfare, since I
must be journeying onwards before to-morrow night. "
So soon Ligonia ? I exclaimed, and may I not speak
to you now, and will you not unmask ? nay then, you
must not, you cannot reproach mejustly with boldness,
for my heart is honest. But little can I know of the forms
of etiquette, or of the rules set down for female propri-
ety . I am told they are arbitrary, and I guess that in
some degree, the manner often passes for the matter ;
be that as it may, there are surely exceptions to every
rule of conduct. I see my protector from insult, my
best , my only friend a prey to despair ; my heart
glows with the most ardent desire to sooth, to comfort,
and console him, whose amiable character is apprecia-
tedby all. Alas ! the power I bear is denied me, but
CLARA GAZUL. 113
my heart is too full , and it would burst where I to be si-
lent. Ligonia ! I repeat mine is an honest heart, and
every thought, and every wish towards you, is pure as
your own mind.
" No more of this Clara ! -You distress me, " said
Ligonia.
瀑Nay then, I exclaimed in a tremulous voice, this is
harshness, and you are unkind to trifle with a poor
friendless girl , giving her the most touching proofs of
disinterested kindness, yet would have her return then
with cold ingratitude. Oh ! how have I thoughtof you, and
and prayed for you, and how eloquent I have fancied I
could plead to you ! what projects have I not for ned to
restore you to tranquillity ! how sanguine have been
my dreams ! In some of them me thought you smil-
ed, and were pleased with mydevotion to you ! I have
watched for you in the twilight of the evening, I have
sang to you while you enjoyed the delicate repast my
own hands had prepared for you -- Sometimes I have
stood amidst the thickest of the battle , stout of heart and
able and willing to administer to your distresses , or
your wounds, bodily or mental I was your companion
in sorrow, and in health-Your head has rested on my
bosom, and I have watched your sweet sleep with plea-
sure untold, when I have fancied it refreshing. Alas !
alas ! that all this should have passed but in my dreams !
" And who dose more than dream of happiness Cla-
ra ?" asked Ligonia in a softened voice expressive of
of the deepest melancholy.
Let us awake then Ligonia to stern truth, let us dream
no more ! thy heart is chilled ! thou art as cold as
marble-so then, will I be -you shall not hear my
voice -I will be no officious hand- maid to vex you with
misplaced tenderness Live if thou wilt in solitude !
-eternal solitude, but place me where the sound of
thy foot- step shall cheer my heart and inspire me with
courage -Nay ! I will not listen to you, I read the
omnious wave of your hand ! -spake not ! -Pause dear
114 CLARA GAZUL.
Ligonia e're you turn away from the prayer of poor
Clara , who is friendless and lives but in this hope ! -
turn notfrom the child of your bounty, who asks of Hea-
ven but to live in the same atmosphere with you, who
breathes no prayers but for your repose, and prospects are
all a blank if you forsake her. Think you I could thus
plead but for that secret voice which whispers to me, I
could comfort your affliction and deserve your esteem ?
My friend ! my noble, kind, and generous benefactor,
continued I, throwing myself on my knees, and bending
my face over his hand to hide my tears, pray, oh ! pray
take me with you, our tears shall mingle and so lose
half their bitterness. I shall soon grow older and
wiser, and I will learn to deserve your friendship. My
heart shall be schooled by yours, and every thing, I
hope, or wish, or prey for shall be comprized in these
four simple words, " thy will be done. "
Ligonia drew aside his mask, raised me in his arms,
and hide my face in his bosom.
IT WAS THE SWEETEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE .
The spot where we stood was completely shaded
from observations by tall trees.-
" I am not of stone Clara, " said Ligonia, tenderly
kissing my cheek.- " I am a man, yet liable to the pas-
sions and fellings of my sex, but I have forsworn them.
There is in my memory that which forbids me to wish
for rest until I shall find it in the tomb ! -I would you
could read my heart, none know the anguish that is bu-
ried here, " said he touching his breast.-" Me- thinks
you who can love one so wretched and absorded in his
ownmisery ought to know him. I can confided in you
and I am inclined to place my life in your hands -yet ,
' twere folly surely at your tender age to shock you with
a tale of horror ' twere madness -so the world
would call it, to confide the most important secret on
which existence hangs, to the keeping of aninfant ."
CLARA GAZUL. 115
Tell menothing ! -I will here no secret ofimport to
youuntil I am older, and yet more sure of my own pru-
dence. Enough ofhappiness is mine at this instant ;
I would not frighten away your disposition to be kind
to mywishes, by asking too much. Sufficient for the
delightful moment is my waking present sense, that tells
me all is not illusion and that I have been held in reality
of tenderness to your heart.
" Adream ! all a dream of unreal joy ! The mere
fever of the brain ! -Thou wouldst shrink in horror
from my embrace, were you awake Clara, " said Ligo-
nia, distractedly turning from me.
You frighten me Ligonia said I, hastening after him
and seizing hold of his gown with my trembling hands.
Have pity on me ! Hint not at things too horrible for
me to imagine, or I shall lose my senses -Talk not
to me with that countenance, so sweet, so sad, yet so
noble, that the recollection ever makes my heart thrill
with tenderness. Hint not to me I beseech you ofsuch
crimes as could make me turn from you in horror. Sit
near me Ligonia, and I will try to sooth this phantom of
your feverish imagination.
Ligonia's hand which I ventured to press, was chill
and clammy, he did not withdraw it , but sighed heavily
as he seated himselfby my side.
Surely, Ligonia, said I, Heaven's wrath for the hea-
viest crimes are appeased by man's sincere repentance,
andjustice is rendered to offended society by a life of
sacrifice to our fellow creature's happiness. Why then
do you talk of despair ? Some pass their lives in the
commission ofpetty vices and selfish sins ; others there
are of a nobler character possesed ofgreat virtues, who
have at some fatal moment committed a crime ! a sin-
gle crime ! in lieu of a host of endless vices : Yet the
sincere repentance the contrition of either will find
rest here and hereafter. How has my heart glowed
with pleasure when I heard of the sacrifices you have
made for the relief and comfort of the distressed sol-
diers underyour command. Dear Ligonia, I would

share your fate here and hereafter; fearlessly would I share
it for I believeyoucapable of all good and noble actions.
" Clara, the sweet tones of your voice have magic in
them to blunt the keenness of my sorrow ; yourbeauty
is so bright, your warmth of heart so genuine, your firm-
ness so touching, that all will live in my recollection.
Your love I cannot return, for my heart is seared with
sorrow ; yet I would fain express to you my deep sense
of your kindness , my gratitude, my "
Then go not hence, my dearest friend, go not away
from me for ever.
"Alas !" sighed Ligonia, and paused-
Oh ! not to-morrow, I exclaimed. Fleeting and
transitory are our moments of happiness ; abridge not
mine, the last I may know on earth ; the purest I have
yet experienced. Stay yet to look with me on one more
revolving moon ! See she smiles on my prayers, and as
Iplead, that dark cloud is passing away, leaving her
beams bright as my hopes. -You will stay, Ligonia ?
-Ipressed his hand between mine, and looked ea-
gerly in his face.
" Clara, it were madness ! ”
Nay, this is cruel, said I, let each day bear it's bur-
then, grant me only this little respite -Oh ! strange
being to fly from my presence as though I were conta-
gious poison.
"Be it as thou wilt then, Clara, " said Ligonia, with
an effort to drive away painful reflections .
My happiness was now perfect, delightful state ofex-
treme youth when the buoyant spirit lives but in the
present moment of fairy hopes and visions of bliss,
which pass away with the hour.
" Heaven bless thee, and farewell ! " said Ligonia,
"you are to visit the Countess Polignac to-morrow,
and there I will meet you -yet Clara, were is thy pru-
dence thus to throw thyself upon the honor of a stran-
ger. Consider the temtation you throw in his way :
what if he should be undeserving of the trust you repose
CLARA GAZUL. 117
inhim ! Should passion yet exist in his breast stronger
thanhis discretion, would you forgive him? "
Farewell Ligonia, I whispered in a voice tremulous
with happiness, Clara confides in you, she is yours and
you will not offend her, for your heart is kind and she
trusts you.
"But," retorted Ligonia , " if the charm with magic
force were to drown for an instant the voice ofhonor
and remorse ?"
Ligonia, I answered, I dread no harm when you are
near me, nor have I in those moments room in my heart
for ought but happiness, sweet as my brightest dreams
e'erpictured.
" Sleep then secure in thy innocent love, for a grate-
ful but wretched man," said Ligonia, when having once
more pressed me to his heart we separated hastily, at
the approach of the merry pedlar and gipsy who passed
me at that moment. " Oh! you sly hermit ! you hoary
sinner, " exclaimed the pedlar in lively accents.
"Go
hide thee in thy den false hermit, " the gipsy called out
as Ligonia was departing.
And whence this unusual severity towards an indivi-
dual who is received by our host ? I asked, Me thinks
young gipsy, thy satire has in it, more of harshness,
than point or aptness.
" Maiden, thou speaketh after thy light which is dark-
ness," she replied : " I am a soothsayer, and I warn
thee, there is blood upon the hermit's hands, I read them
but now, and me thinks thyself stood by when the guilty
man trembled before my wisdom. "
Gipsy, thy voice sounds in my ear, like the croaking
of some omnious bird of ill promise. I'll tarry no lon-
ger near thy spell ; I'll away from thee, dingy sorceress ,
black witch whom I begin to hate in sober earnest.
" Surely I know that voice," said the pedlar, adding
"your tones grow more familiar to me, you are certain-
ly the young lady we havebeen all the evening in search
of you are Miss Clara-
1
118 CLARA GAZUL.
Andyou Sir are ?
" Your old friend Doctor Lambert," unmasking as
hespoke .
I expressed myjoy at this unexpected meeting.
Mutual congratulations having passed, the Doctor
addressed me to this effect . " I hope when myyoung
patient unmasks you will receive her with open arms ;"
here the young gipsy suffered her mask to be loosened ,
and Mademosselle St. Sauveur offered me her hand.
Without accepting it, I coldly expressed my hopes
that I saw her in good health.
The Docter briefly gave me the following account of
himself ; " On his arrival in London he had immediate-
lyplaced his patient under the care of Doctor Willis ;
change ofscene and the skill of this most eminent phy-
sician, had proved all powerful in restoring Mademoi-
selle St. Sauveur to health, who was entirely cured of
her former dreadful malady. Her lungs, however, be-
ing delicate, ajourney to Italy was deemed advisable,
they were, therefore, on their road towards the resi-
dence of a female relation of the Doctor's, who had
married a Florentine, and resided ten leagues from Na-
ples. They had called at the Cardinal's and there
learn't that I was at the Masquerade ; had therefore, by
means of all powerful gold procured tickets and disgui-
ses desiring to shake hands with me, as they passed
through Naples, which place theyproposed leaving as
soon as the fete was over. "
I endeavoured to reason away the disgust and cold-
ness I felt towards poor Mademoiselle St. Sauveu, for
having attempted to destroy Ligonia I fear I was not
very successful, and my manner seemed to offend Doc-
tor Lambert, but the young lady, on taking her leave,
proposed writing to mefrom the country, and most cor-
dialy shook me bythe hand.
I wanted to forgive her but could not ; she had ap-
peared before mein such an unpropitious moment, when
my heart was glowing with love towards him whose life
CLARA GAZUL. 119
she hadattemtedto destroy , andmy mind was doubly
hardened against her, by that instinctive and unaccount
able severity which even in her present sane state of in-
tellect , she had asecond time evinced towards Ligo-
nia .
Aloud merrypeal ofbells now summoned allthegay
masks to a sumptuous supper, served in a suit of apart-
ments fitted up with regal magnificence. I will not at
tempt to describe this feast of made dishes, and flow of
bowls, my head was giddy with anticipation of expected
happiness in the society of Ligonia.
Onmy entrance, I remember noticing the twelve
minstrels who sat tuning their harps at the bottom of
theroom. I cannever forget the beauty of our fair
hostess which seemed too bright for earth, and her
spangled robe of azure blue, the many glittering dia-
monds in her hair, her soft smile, her languid delicacy,
her fairy hands and feet, and her rosy little slipper just
visible on the rich carpet, I remember too that the young
prince Orazio was seated by her side, and their looks of
burning intelligence, their blushes, their whispers soft
as the air of their native skies, and then the Marquis St.
Betise !!! How rapt was he in the sweets of harmo-
ny !!! My eager eyes vainly sought the hermit, but the Car-
dinal ! me thinks I see him now in his red hat and other
episcopal dignities, lending a willing left or right ear to
his graceful flatterers , the two green dominos, his bright
eyes sparkling like the wine in his goblet, nor do I for-
get Eugenio, the handsome page, or his white and silver
costume, which made him look so bland and fair, or the
love that spoke in his pensive eyes, for my heart was all
made up of passion.
Atouch of melancholy was mixed with my happy
sensations on that evening, when visions ofbliss flitted
across my brain. Pity, the most intense for Ligonia,
was mingled with the bright hope that I could soften his
sorrow.
120 CLARA GAZUL.
Covering my eyes with my hand, in order to shut out
all these objects, I indulged for an instant in luxurious
recollection.
These sweet reflections were interrupted by the gen-
tle voice of the page Eugenio, who whispered in my ear,
en passant " Clara the hermit is knownto me, may you
be happy to the extent of your most sanguine wishes ;
I told you I would never encourage jealousy ; good
night dear Clara ! May he whom you love, deserve
you. " I was about to answer the page with affectionate ten-
derness, but he had vanished. It was past six in the
morning when the party broke up, I then threw rew myself
on my couch, quite exhausted, to dream of Ligonia.

## Chapter XIII. CONTAINING THE CONFESSIONS OF EUGENIO'S MOTHER
-A SCENE WITH THE GREATEST MAN OF HIS AGE.
-A LOVE SCENE - A PARTING.
The Countess of Polignac received me with the
warmest expressions of friendship, and invited me to
her boudoir, where an elegant breakfast was prepared
for us. Having partaken of it together, the Countess
briefly related to me what I will endeavour as nearly as
possible to put down in her own words : -" My real
name it will be necessary to conceal under that of my
relative's , the Count of Polignac : I was bred in the
Protestant faith, my husband was many years in the ser-
vice of the French Republic. I had the honour to be
engaged in the year 1799, as first lady of the bed-cham-
ber, to Josephine, the wife of Bonaparte. Young, and
singularly romantic, I admired and looked up to the
then first Consul as to a being superior to all the world.
On his part he ever treated me with marked and flatter-
ing attention. Allow me to pass briefly over the subject
of mydisgrace.
" Neglected by my husband, and fascinated by the
glory that surrounded Napoleon, in a fatal moment, I
lost sight ofhonor, and the respect due to myself .
But I soon repented of my crime. The first Con-
sul's temper was uncertain, and he often treated me
with harsh neglect. Stung to the quick by his careless
indifference, I resolved to conceal from him my preg-
nancy, for which purpose I begged permission to resign
my situation, pleaded ill health as my excuse for quit-
ting the Count , and retiring to anestate I possessed
nearNaples.
F
122 CLÁRA GAZUL
My husband was absent on a secret mission, and not
expected to return for many months.
The kind Josephine parted from me with regret. A
dear respected aunt who accompanied me to Naples,
advised me to conceal my real name under the one I
now bear.
"The Lady Poco-puranti and myselfwere educated
together ; I flew to my old school-fellow, and having
laid openmy heart and explained to her my unfortunate
situation , I implored her on my knees to take charge of
myunfortunate infant, as soon as it should be born, and
sosave me from disgrace, and the indignation of my
justly offended husband.
"After consulting her brother, the Cardinal, it was
agreed that my poor infant should be placed in abasket
and slung to the gates of their Castello, when they pro-
misedto adopt it.
" Three months after my arrival at Naples, and in
this very house, my son Eugenio first saw the light.
"You are surprised, Miss Clara, but judge me not
too severely. You know not the wiles of a court, or
half the temptation I had to err !
" Let me hasten to conclude a story which is painful
to me to relate.
"Awet nurse was provided secretly, and all necessa-
ry preparations being made, for the safety and preserva-
tion of my infant's health, the kind Countess received
him from her gates, and immediately explained to her
household that since providence had thrown this poor
deserted innocent on her mercy, she had resolved to
adopt it, asher own.
"Vainly should I attempt to do justice to the indefa-
tigable kindness which the lady Poco- puranti has ever
evinced, towards my poor boy, whombyher means, I
have beenpermitted to press daily in my arms.
The
first three years of his existence, was passed by me in
retirement, never interrupted, save by the occasional
visit of the Cardinal and his sister. The beauty of my
CLARA GAZUL. 128
childwasthe theme of all who saw him, andhis lively
temper , madehim a favorite with every one.
About this time I receiveda letter from myhusband ,
announcing his approaching return, and inviting me to
meet him at Paris.
Trembling between shame and dread of his presence,
Ihastened to obey his summons, and having taken a
tender leave of my child and his kind guardians, I arri-
ved in the French capital a few weeks before my hus-
band.
"He was much changed, and I thought he observed
me with doubt and suspicion. He often questioned me
as to mymotive for quitting the service of Josephine,
and while making these enquiries, he would fix his eyes
on my face, as though he would have penetrated my
most secret thoughts. Athousand times I was on the
point, ofthrowing myself at his feet, and confessingmy
crime, but shame, and fear of his violence, tied my
tongue.
" I passed about five years in Paris, and its environs
consumed with melancholy, deprived of the presence of
my beloved child, and feeling myselfan object of dis-
trust and suspicion to a jealous husband. My chief
consolation, during that period, was the letters I receiv-
ed from my friend the Lady Poco- puranti, bringing me
accounts of the progress of my dear child in every
branch of his education, of his strength and beauty, his
taste for study, his passion for reading, and thirst for
general information.
" In short, the accounts that were poured into the
gratified ear of a fond mother, were such as to make me
fancymy child would turn outaprodigy oflearning and
beauty .
"Possessing a large paternal inheritance in Italy , I
neednotsaythat I spared no expence in the progress
of mydarlingboy's education. Having at this time at-
tained his ninth year, it became advisable that he should
come to Paris, in order to be placed in the most distin

guished college to fit him for the university. Myaffec
tionate friend, the LadyPoco-puranti, accompaniedmy
son to Paris, and with the assistance of a friend, saw
him, safely installed, and under the auspices of a tutor ,
distinguished for his learning and general merit, before
she returned to Italy.
"Eugenio was now inParis, yet washis tender pa-
rent deprived of the pleasure of calling him her son.
What agony of mind has this restraint occasioned me !
It was with difficulty my kind aunt, who returned with
me to Paris, contrived to procure me anoccasional in-
terview with Eugenio.
" How seldom seemed our meetings to my eager af-
fection ! Often have I watched for hours the chance of
beholding my child during his hours of recreation, which
were some times passed in an orchard adjoining the col-
lege that was situated in the neighbourhood of the capi-
tal .
" Maternal affection, at length too strong for longer
restraint, burst forth, and during a short absence which
my husband made, I one day having obtained a private
interview with my darling child, threw my arms about
his neck and disclosed the fatal secret which was to
doomhim to shame and disgrace for ever.
" My confession was made just when my son had
obtained his tenth year. The deep impression it pro-
duced on his young mind proved his sensibility ofheart,
and that maturity ofthought and judgement, the knowl-
edge of which had given mecourage to entrust him thus
young with the secret of his birth. Wounded and bit-
terly lamenting his own situation, yet did he sooth me
the tenderest profession ofduty andfilial affection. Af-
ter this eclaircissement my mind grew calmer.
"My son's progress astonished his preceptors, the
best of his studies were directed towards acquiring apro-
found knowledge of the laws of the land, not with aview
alone that he should one day become great as acoun-
sellor , but his ambition soared higher still . He would
CLARA GAZUL. 125-
create new laws, and become the means of higher and
essential benefit and increased happiness to mankind ;
a great and eloquent legislator, a martyr to some noble
cause, that his renown might live after him, and thatchil-
drenunborn might bless the name of him who had bet-
tered the lot of his fellow species. Such were the bright,
honorable, and romantic dreams of Eugenio's earliest
youth, inspired by the benevolence of his heart, and that
ambitious disposition which might in a son of Nasoleon
Bonaparte, be supposed an hereditary quality.
" My son before he was twelve years of age passed
the most brilliant examination in the college of Henri
IV. which had been known for many years, and was
spoken of by the professors as a young protege ofdeep
learning, besides having acquired many lighter accom-
plishments, particularly that ofmusic.
" The Emperor, who happened to visit that celebra-
ted college, a few days after my son's successful exami-
nation had taken place, lent an attentive ear to the praise
bestowed on young Eugenio by various professors at-
tached to the establishment, which was then particularly
patronized by Bonaparte himself .
"On learning that the boy was a protege of the Car-
dinal Poco-puranti, who possessed large estate in Na-
ples, andthat he had been found athis gate when an in-
fant , Napoleon commanded Eugenio to be brought be-
fore him. Mychild came into the presence of his un-
conscious parent with feelings much agitated, almost
amounting to dislike. The Emperor addressed him in
avoice and with a manner unusually kind. It almost
seemedas ifnature spokeby instinctin the father's heart.
" Taking the youth aside and having questioned him
patiently as to his studies, he patted the beautiful boy's
head and told him he would be his friend, and not lose
sight of his interests, while he continued to distinguish
himself . Eugenio greatly surprised and much offended
his preceptors by the rude abruptness of his replies.
ト
126 CLARA GAZUL.
" I hope Sire to dispense with patronage altogether , "
was my son's uncourteous answer.
" And why so child ? " said the Emperor, half smi-
ling halfdispleased.
"Fatherless from my cradle, Sire, I have ever felt it
myduty to strive to make my way through the world,
bymeans of my own steady exertions alone, unassisted
by anygreat man's patronage whatever, until I have ac-
quiredthe taste as well as state of independence, and
that to such an extent Sire, that me thinks I would refuse
adiadem that policy or patronage should place upon
mybrow, and were not mine by birth-right. "
" You grow saucy youngster," said the Emperor.
" May I retire Sire !"
" Attendez donc ! attendez done !* Would you like
the army for aprofession ?"
" No Sire ! "
"What if I were to take you near my own person ?
Would you refuse to form one of my body-guard ?"
" Sire, I will not be a soldier , unless my country
should be invaded, and then I would defend her with
my best blood and abilities. "
" Yet I am told you are ambitious boy, and the army
opens a wide field for renown at this moment, " said the
Emperor.
" Vanity, Sire may be satisfied with mean advanta-
ges , butmy ambition soars higherthan yours. I would
not stoop down to have a crownplaced on my head that
never of right belonged to it ; neither would I marry
for promotion, nor care for conquests which could never
benefit mankind ; nor would my conscience permit me
to slaughter my fellow-creatures oftener than my reason
should tell me, that to war with them was inevitable, for
the safety and preservation of our citizens, and our
countrymen . "
*Stay ! stay aminute.

CLARA GAZUL. 127
"Thou shal't take orders, and be apriest , boy , "
said the Enperor ironically.
" Not I indeed ! said Eugenio boldly, " for I ama
protestant -I hate priesthood, and the whole system of
popish infallibility, so much so, that I cannotforgive any
one who would stoop to patronize it , believing every
such man to be either a fool, or a hypocrite. "
" There are situations," said the Emperor, with unu-
sual mildness and moderation such as astonished those
about him, " there are surely situations a man may be
thrown into , where what would else be termed hypo-
crisybecomes matter of mere common necessary poli-
cy -situations in which he naturlly and wisely embrace
one steady vast plan, in defience of all larger or small-
er obstacles, setting at nought certain forms which
would obstruct the less expanded views of common
men -If faut voir l'ensemble -Il faut voir les choses
engrand -Il faut voir avec mes yeux -Il faut entrer
dans mes vues, monenfant, avantd'oser me critiquer. "*
In saying this the Emperor playfully touched Euge-
nio's cheek with his glove.
" Sire!" said my child somewhat softened towards
his parent athearing himselfunconsciously called " mon
enfant" " I am not prepared to prove that hypocrisy is,
under any circumstances bad policy, or that a govern-
ment which is not founded on the simple principal of
truth and honour must eventually be crushed, be it gov-
erned bywhom it may, because I am but a child and the
arguments I could produce would probably be weak
and unsatisfactory ; but I am old enough to know my
ownmind , and I could suffer or die if it were necessary,
beforemypride would allow me to act with deception ;
and me thinks were I an Emperor, I should consider
that my safty as well as glory rested on the merits and
affections of my people. "
*You must look at the whole together , examine things at large

128 CLARA GAZUL.
"And are our people disaffected then thinks't thou
pert boy, " enquired the Emperor.
" I know not Sire, for I never lived in the world, but
I should guess that, though we may be fascinated for a
time by abrilliant character, our permanent respect and
affection can only rest with him, whom principals and
pure motives of action should command and compel us
to esteem even long after the fashion of his celebrity
should have died a natural death. "
" Thou wouldst make me angry child, were it in thy
power , it should seem ," said the Emperor.
" Nay Sire, I didbut state my opinion of an unprinci-
pled king, but since you are so touchy, even on extra-
neous matters, I would fain retire with your gracious
permission. "
" Va-t -en petit drole,*" said the Emperor, " mais
ecoute thou art a singular child, and though unpolished
and rude to thy superiors I like thy countenance and
thy sharpeness. Give me thyhand. "
Eugeniohalfpleased, half reluctant, presented his lit-
tlehand to the Emperor. Napoleon took from his pock-
et a smallgold snuff box, with his likeness excellently en-
graved on the lid, and presenting it to Eugenio, saidwith
much cordiality, whilst pressing the child's fingers over
thebox. " Ne me raillez plus mon petit ami -Soyons
bons amis -Nous nons reverrons !"†
The son spoke for an instant in the heart of the child,
whichwarmedtowards his parent, and dropping grace-
fully on one knee, he pressed his rosy lips on the Em-
peror's hand. Napoleon's countenance expressed admiration and
pleasure as he gazed on the blooming boy at his feet,

whom hequickly raised, saying, " Embrasse moi mon
enfant bien -Est ce de bon cœur * ? "
" Mais -oui ! † " said Eugenio, putting his arms
about the Emperor's neck, after a moment's pause, and
giving him as unceremonious and warm a hug as though
his Majesty had been aware of their relationship, to the
astonishment of the grave professors, and great amuse-
ment of the Emperor, who left the colledge in high good
humour.
" I afterwards asked my child why he had first re-
ceived the advances of the Emperor so uncourteously
and afterwards embraced him so cordially ?
" The vanity and vices of the Emperor, disgust me,"
said Eugenio " but I could not resist the kind tone of
my parent, the less, because it was tendered to me vol-
untary when I had least right to expect it. "
" I tire you Clara," said the Countess de Polignac .
Having assured her Ladyship with truth, of the deep
interest I took in her story, she continued as follows :-
"But little more remains for me to relate of my melan-
choly adventures. My husband accompanied Mare-
chalNey to Russia, and lost his life in that disastrous
campaign at the battle fought by the Imperial armies be-
tween Ghiac and Mojaisk in 1812.
Ligonia, who was in the Russian service, and had
fought in Prince Kutusoff's army, under the auspices
of the old Count Drognichieff, was entrusted by the em-
peror Alexander with a secret mission to the court of
the Tuilleries, and dispatched to Paris, where Napoleon
had arrived soon after the fatal passage of the Beresina.
"He brought me in person the melancholy news of
myhusband's having died in his arms. Aletter from
my lost husband came to hand three days after Ligonia's
first visit. In that letter he spoke of Ligonia, as of one
*Embrace memy child -Is it with all your heart ?

whose noble conduet and generous forbearance in the
field of battle was above all praise.
Ligonia remained some weeks in Paris and interes-
ted himself in the arrangement of myaffairs with asmuch
warmth and zeal, as though he had been my brother.
In the desponding state of my mind, and my heart al-
most broken, I felt that , but for his active kindness, I
must have lost my senses. My son loved him with his
whole heart, and respected him asthe first of men; and
when Ligonia's mission terminated, and his military du-
ties forced him to depart, we were as deeply affected,
as though we had known each other all our lives.
Such real acts of affectionate kindness did we receive
from him, that I was induced to explain every particular
of my unfortunate situation. He promised, unasked,
to cherish my poor Eugenio as a brother.
"To conclude -shortly after the departure of Ligo-
nia , we were on our road journeying back towards Na-
ples, accompanied by my son's tutor, under whose in-
struction he proposed entering on a course of reading
which should perfect him in such sciences as he prefer-
red, as well as in the deep and profound knowledge of
practical law, which, he desired to join to elocution , of
astyle that already held out the promise of obtaining,
rare and brilliant superiority.
" My child's birth is still a secretto the world. Fain
would I dare to seem what I am. Shame, ties my
tongue and forbids the exposure of my disgrace. Eu-

quitted Naples.

few months I have been preparing my mind for our sep-
aration, and that nothing may be wanting to form his
mind and manners, Eugenio must travel . The mo
ment is at hand -the pang is past and my child with
his tutor accompanies his beloved friend through Italy
and afterwards to Russia.
" Ligonia brings him an invitation from the old Count
Drognichieff, who resides near Wilna where the Empe-
ror's head quarters have been established some time.
They take their departure by to-morrow's dawn, when
unless you feel pity for my solitude and come to me, I
shall be disconsolate.
" Joyfully I accept your invitation , I exclaimed, ad-
ding that I would on that evening mention to the Lady
Poco- puranti my earnest wish to leave her house for of
the Countess ofPolignac's, since Miss Laura, for whom
I had been engaged, had departed , and my services
wereno longer necessary at the Cardinal's. Our con-
versation was shortly afterwards interrupted by a ser
vant who announced the visit of Ligonia.
"Howdid my heart bound ! How the colour rushed
to mycheek !! He paid the usual compliments to me
inavoice which sounded affectionately tender. The
Countesswasnever tired ofquestioning him as to their
route, making memorandums of where her darling son
wasto sleep, or dine on the road . Ligonia informed
us that Eugenio could notescape from the eagartender-
ness of all the inhabitants at the Palazzo ofPocopuranti .
His old and first nurse sat weeping and hugging him by
turns. Not a menial that did not tender her little hum-
ble gift of friendship to the beautiful young page , who

hadbeenbredamongst them, and was going to such a
cold and distant country. Eugenio's choice ofpresents
tohis old companions was happy, offering to each exact-
lywhat they were most likely to want.
Not a friend or even a child was forgotten by this
kind hearted youth, among those who had regarded him
with affection.
At length he contrived to disengage himself from his
earliest acquaitances, and soon after he had joined us,
his mother proposed that Ligonia should accompany
me in a walk before dinner ; whether this tete- a-tete
was planned out of regard to my wishes, or those of
Ligonia, I could guess. Fain would I have believed
the latter.
Love scenes, however exquisite to those who figure
in them, are to me heavy in the description. The fee-
lings of enthusiasm which had, under the mask, given
me a sort of unnatural courage, by the light of the lamp
was now changed to shy timidity. Hanging on the arm
of Ligonia, my sensations were so exquisite, that I al-
most feared even lest the sound of my voice should di-
minish, or destroy the charm . We directed our steps
towards the bay . Ligonia spoke to me of his satis-
faction in leaving me under the protection ofso amiable
alady as the Countess de Polignac. I eagerly enqui-
red when and where we might have the chance of meet-
ing again.
"Heaven only knows, " said Ligonia " perhaps in
France, perhaps in England, perhaps never ! But re-
member our last night's conversation Clara ! Let us ba-
nish all thought of the future and endeavour to enjoy the
hour. "
Ligoniawith an art peculiarly his own, drew out all
mypower of conversation ; my playful remarks were
more successful than Idared to hope : he became al-
most cheerful.
All mysophistry, I blush to ownit, was then exerted
toreconcilehim to himself , yet I felt a secretconviction
CLARA GAZUL . 133
that he had committed some heavy crime. The ardor of
myaffectionhad made me perhaps short sighted ; be
that as it may, my love was increased by the mystery
that obscured the character of Ligonia. The dread of
his supposed crimes rendered mypassion for him more
intense from the heartfelt pity which his repentance and
desponding melancholy inspired. I tried to prove by
many ingenious arguments that to enjoy the present
and to forbear idle speculation, or retrospection of past
crimes, was too fulfil the order of nature. I was no
saint, and love had not stifled the small still wispers of
religion in my impassioned mind ; dreary as the sandy
desarts of Arabia would be my path in life alone, while
the bare thought ofsuch happiness as I could enjoy with
Ligonia, made my heart thrill with rapture for too sweet
and wild to be subdued by the reason of sixteen.
Leaving the bay to the right we arrived at a most love-
ly retreat, which sheltered us from a heavy storm by
which we were unexpectedly overtaken. -" We are
alone, Clara, " said Ligonia, " no eye observes us, the
present is ours, nor the past nor the future shall trouble
this moment, and since thou woulds't have thine, I am
no anchorite or marble stone to resist the beauty so
bright and intelligent, thy love so sweet, and thy soft and
glowingblushes. "
Ligonia had thrown his arm about my waist, -the fire
ofpassion beamed in his dark eye, my head was sinking
on his bosom, when he suddenly withdrew himselffrom
my embrace. After a pause during which he had turn-
edaway from my anxious gaze, " Clara ," said he,
"the atmosphere is clearing , let us return ; thou hast
placedthy fate in my hands, thou hast bestowed thy
youngheart on a stranger, for whose safety thou wouldst
have sacrificed thy life. With me, thou must be safe ;
buttempt me no further, nor deceive thyself ; thy love
would lose itsgreatest charm with the innocence that
purifies and refines it. Destroy the mystery, -lift up
the veil which ignorance throws over your desires, as
134 CLARA GAZUL.
yetvague as dreams of Heaven, and we become mere
common lovers , partaking with the herd of mortals of
theircommonappetites with satiety that ever follows
their indulgence.
" Look up, dear Clara, droop not, " added Ligonia ,
observing the shame that overspread my cheek, with
which I was almost sinking into the earth ; "Dread no
censure from Ligonia, for he loves thee as thou art, with
all thy imprudence, thy impassioned ardor, and thy ten-
der devotion to his will . If ever my distracted mind
will permit me to hope for the enjoyment of one hour
ofdomestic comfort, Clara, thou shalt share it -thou
shalt rest in my bosom, and be mycherished wife. Till
then, I will watch over thy happiness with a father's
care. " Ligonia here changed the subject to one more
general and less interesting, purposely leading me to-
wards amore public promenade.
Howpure werenow my sensations as I listened to
Ligonia , hanging on his arm , and watchinghis counten-
ance, the noblest and most expresive I had ever be-
held, yet so still and pale , that it seemed to me earthly
beauty . Ligonia's advice for my future conduct was offered
with the tender solicitude of a parent.
" I have lived and suffered till I amweary of life, and
carenotwhenI take myleave of the rude scene," said
he , " savethat I would first exert every nerve to sooth
and softenthe misery that the duties of my profession
have thrown in myway -but your happiness, Clara , is
dearto me. Beprudent then, as you would avoid vex-
ingtheheartof anunhappy man. Letme fancy in the
dead of thenight when I am reclined on a restless
couch , that the beautiful eyes of Clara Gazul , of her
wholovesme, are closed in calm sweet sleep. And
maybe, with this convictiononmymind , Imayrest too,
anddream of her. In absence , cold as you suppose
me, yet will the recollection of your beauty, as I first
beheldyou, so young and wild , your accents so sweet
CLARA GAZUL. 135
and energetic, your bright eyes raised beseechingly to
heaven, your tears, and all that luxurious hair, which
floated in the breeze of the evening -yet will the recol-
lection of all these realities and Clara Gazul's beauty,
often flit across mymemory, like a gay vision sent from
heaven, to lighten my deep despair. "
Andyou will leave me, said I with a profound sigh.
" Why, dearest, will you vex me with reproaches ?
Trust to my honor ; and be certain, if I depart, that
some imperious duty forces me away from you, or some
feelings of remorse, which at present are not to be over-
come. Ligonia tenderly pressed my arm, just at the
moment of our reaching the Palazzo of the Countess,
whomwe found impatiently waiting our arrival.
Dinner was shortly afterwards served, of which we all
partook sparingly, being deeply affected with the idea
ofour fast approaching separation. The amiableEuge-
nio, much as he desired to see the world, could not
leave his adoring mother without a struggle.
Early in the evening, the Lady Poco-puranti sent her
carriage for me, when I bida tender farewell to Ligonia
and Eugenio. Both pressed me in their arms, and kis-
sed my cheek. My tears fell fast as again and again I
offered my prayers for their welfare. As Ligonia con-
ducted me across the long corridors to the carriage, he
placed a small parcel in my hand " Keep this for my
sake, " he whispered -Our lips met in one long sweet
embrace -The rays of the bright moon fell upon Ligo-
nia's pale features. See how cloudless she shines on
our hopes, said I. -In another instant, I was alone in the
carriage driving through the streets of Naples towards
the Cardinal's habitations, as fast as his high spirited
horses could bear meaway.

## Chapter XIV. THE ASSASSINS-DOCTOR STACATO AND DOCTOR AGITATO - FATHER PIETRO.

On arriving at the Cardinal's I flew to my chamber and hastened to examine the parcel which Ligonia had placed in my hand. What joy did I experience at the sight of a most excellent likeness in miniature of my beloved. The picture was set in brilliants of considerable value, and represented him in the full Russian uniform, after covering it with tender kisses, I had just time to place it in my bosom, when some one tapped at my door. It was the lady Poco-puranti, who came to pass half an hour with me. On enquiring for her brother I was informed that his Eminence had not yet left the dining saloon, where he entertained the too green dominos. The Lady Poco-puranti was uneasy - never knew the Cardinal remain so late at table - could not guess what good motive the two strangers could have for their perseverance in masking their faces -had remonstrated with her brother as to the impropriety of receiving such ambiguous characters, but all in vain; the Cardinal was convinced that his visitors were noble. In short, their graceful flattery had found the way to his heart, and they had been carousing for many hours. 

Their merry peals of laughter had resounded along the hall. The lady now changed the subject to that of the Countess de Polignac, when I seized this opportunity of begging permission to remove to that kind lady's house on the following day. 

No objections were offered, the Countess was her oldest friend and school-fellow, and she had never refused her wishes: she would
### Page 137

often visit us, she said, and promised to interest herself of me welfarer.

While I was endeavouring to express my gratitude, our ears were assailed with the dismal stiffled cries of

"Help! Murder! Help! Help! Seize the assassins! Help, or I die!

Trembling, and as pale as death. the Lady Poco-puranti rung the bell with violence, and then we hastened along the gallery, where we encountered several of the scared household running to and fro with torches, candles, lamps, or whatever they could lay their hands on.

The cries ceased. We soon reached the saloon, it was empty! On the table were some remains of the sparkling wine which they had been drinking, and a massive gold snuff box had fallen on the ground.

The lights were still burning but without staying to examine further, we all hurried from one room to another, in the deepest alarm. No traces could be discovered of the Cardinal. His tender sister could no longer support herself from very fright , and we led her back to her boidoir, where, reclined on her chaise longue, she awaited the event in almost speechless agony, exclaiming "Oh merciful powers! My brother is being murdured by these disguised ruffians, and no one will assist him!"

Suspense being unsupportable to my eager impatient
nature, after recommending the Lady Poco-puranti to
the care of her woman, I hurried down stairs to the sta-
ble, where I procured alanthorn and accompanied by
Eugenio's old favourite nurse, we commenced our
search over the vast gardens of the Palazzo. We had
wandered for nearly ten minutes from right to left when
to the farthestextremity my foot stumbled against some-
thing heavy.
Holdingdown mylanthorn to ascertain what impeded
mypath, my fright and horror may be easily imagined
at beholding the body of the Cardinal apparently stiff
anddead . The screams of the old nurse brought all
138 CLARA GAZUL.
the household around us, when it was discovered that
the Cardinal still breathed.
He had fainted from loss of blood which flowed from
adeep wound in his side, and had received various oth-
erwounds of a less serious nature : that on the left side
must have proved mortal but that the Cardinal was a
great padder, and the assassin's dagger had alongjour-
ney in wadding to make, before arriving at his heart of
hearts. Believing no doubt, that their murderous pur-
pose had been affected, the ruffians had escaped.
All was confusion and dismay in the Palazzo di Po-
co- puranti. The lady Poco-puranti was in a swoon.
The old butler issued his orders in such a trembling
voice while his teeth did so chatter in his head, that no-
body understood him. The servants mounted their
horses and went in search of the delinquents, having
stoutly resolved to scour the country and bring them to
justice dead or alive. The Cardinal was placed on his
bed, and the celebrated Doctor Spiletti was sent for to
attend him forthwith.
The Surgeon having probed the wound, shook his
head, and was silent ; the Cardinal was still insensible.
There was an awful pause. Doctor Spiletti pulled out
his watch and counted his patients' pulse. " Where is
the father Pietro ;" said he, at length.
" At the bottom of the garden on his knees before the
image of our blessed Virgin" replied the nurse. "
"And what good will he do there, " said the Doctor
half beside himself , for it was a ticklish matter to handle
a Cardinal's wounds .
The secret was this, -according to the anatomy that
Doctor Spiletti had gleaned in the course of his practice
which was little or none, it struck him that the wounded
part ought to be cut away without a moment's loss of
time. He would have made no bones about this, but
have quickly hacked at the wound of any other man at
aventure, trusting to providence to see him wellthrough
it ,but the redhat frightened him. ACardinal being a
CLARA GAZUL. 139
sort of God, all powerful in Italy and Spain, he would
have preferred first trying the effect of exactly such an
operation on the person of any less distinguished indi-
vidual .
Father Pietro having been summoned from his pros-
trate position at the feet of the Virgin, the foot rather,
for Eugenio the page had knocked off the Virgin's left
foot and broken her leg when he was a child and knew
no better, however, Father Pietro entered the room, the
picture of lank misery and despair. No wonder, either,
for where should the pious man hope to get another pat-
ron who kept such a table ? such a cellar too !! And
wine in moderation encouraged zeal, of which no one
could possess too much in a religious cause. No won-
der then that Pietro had hastened to implore the Virgin
to take care of the Cardinal's wounds .
" Art thou a faithful servant ?" said the Doctor to the
priest! " We live by faith " replied Pietro crossing him-
self .
" I am delighted to hear you say so father, -you
wontdie then , so listen to my proposal. Thy beloved
patronis in a swoon, in which state I am reluctant to
attempt any operation, nothing ought to be risked, no
experiment ventured that might by possibility endanger
the life of a Cardinal. But the risk is small, and as thou
art a faithful and true servant of the church, she will
protect you, -permit me therefore to made a small in-
cision in thy side that I may observe in what safest di-
rection I can direct my knife. " TheCurate's face
was the colour of saffron.
"Thy jokes are unseasonable, Doctor," he stammer-
ed out .
" Jokes, exclaimed Doctor Spiletti, " art thou mad,
to dream ofjokes when the Cardinal lies there, and
myreputation, nay my life is at stake ? Liston to me
thou holy man, what flagellation hast thou inflicted on
thy lady for the sake of thy soul during the last year ?
"Alas !" said this true believerwith asigh .
140 CLARA GAZUL .
" I see, I see how it is" observed the Doctor , " thou
art wofully in arrears and must submit to mortify thy
flesh in order to cure thy pampered appetites, thy lewd
and greedy propensities.
"There's an Eeglish proverb about killing two birds
with one stone quite applicable to your case ; let me
practise on thy side to steady my hand and nerves, the
Cardinal's wound will fare better for it, and so man will
thy soul. "
The saffron colour of Father Pietro's countenance
now seemed changing to a greenish hue; cold drops
hung upon his brow, for he was a rank coward, besides
being a true believer in the Pope, and a fool to boot.
Twisting up his nose like a cur coming in contact
with acat, pressing his teeth into his nether lip, and rais-
inghis rayless green eyes upwards , he said in a faint
voice " I am ready. "
"Down with you then , " said the Doctor taking the
poor besotted bigot at his word, who being placed on a
long table with his bosom bare, the Doctor was just
about to make his incision, when the Cardinal sudden-
ly recovering from his swoon, opened his languid eyes.
The first object they fell uponwas the Doctor in the ve-
ry act of about inflicting awound in the breast of the
prostratepriest.
At the sigh of his sharp knife, the Cardinal found
strength to seize hold of a silver candlestick, and send
it at the head of the surgeon, at the same time crying
out in a feeble voice, " murderers !! assassins ! will
no one assist me to secure these murderers ! help !
help."

At this critical moment arrived in his state carriage Doctor Stacato, and immediately after him, Doctor Agitato, both of the king's household. They came by command of his majesty who had heard of the assault on the Cardinal, and had consequently dispatched them immediately.

Stacato stepped on the point of his toes like a man whose shoeswere filled with peas. He was a spruce, dapper looking personage, whose appearance reminded one of an English groom, rather than a member of the learned college of Neapolitan physicians, or of his Majesty's Household.

Dr. Agitato was a very fine gentleman indeed, all over ribbands and orders, and diamond pins and garters his hands covered with rings, andhis whole person impregnated with otto of roses. He was rathera corpulent man , with abright florid complexion, white teeth, and a pair ot pretty twinkling blue eyes. He wore an embroidered cloak, lined with real ermine, gracefully slung over his shoulders, in spite of the heat of the climate, lest "the air should visit him too roughly." True, he had been an accoucheur, at the beck and call of any woman in the straw, but then royal patronage had washed all that dust and filth from his hands.

The doctors meeting in the corridor, saluted each other with a show of cordiality, although in their hearts dwelt envy, jealousy, and vast uncharitableness.

"Your servant, Signor Doctor Stacato, your most obedient, what a calamity! to be disturbed out of one's first nap! I am perished!! and just taken an otto of rose bath. A case of apoplexy this, hey? the Cardinal has no throat. I knew what would happen."

No such thing whispered Stacato, arranging the formal tye of his stiff neckcloth; quite the contrary Signor, the Cardinal has been murdered, or something of that kind.

"Ah! Ah! - Why it is a case for surgeons then, Have they got Spiletti - a monstrous ass, by the bye. Only imagine their bringing me here in a hired vehicle! Pshaw! The odour of it still remains on my cloak. I should not be surprised to find that I had caught some diabolical Lazaroni fever, my teeth are so dancing in myhead."

By this time the two learned physicians having traversed the corridors, arrived at the cardinal's bed chamber,

### Page 142

just at the critical moment when the pious Poco-puranti had senthis silver candlestick, at the head of the surgeon. On entering, their ears were assailed by the cry of murder, assassins, thieves, mingled with the deep groans
ofSpiletti, who had sunk into an easy chair, and hold-
ing ahandkerchief over a deep wound in his forehead .
My faith has saved me, thought Father Pietro, who,
on the entrance of the two great men , was gliding like a
phantom out of the apartment, feeling that it would be
entirely out of the question to screw his courage to the
sticking place a second time even though it should be
byprescription of the two great men themselves.
Agitatio , with much sang froid, having made his
court- bred bow, bent his steps toward the bed, pulling
of his white kid gloves. Having placed his forefinger
for an instant on the patient's wrist, and used the word
" delirious , " in Latin, to Stacato, he addressedthe Car-
dinal with infinite non chalance. " I am sorry to see
your Eminence indisposed ; His Majesty is all sympa-
thy ; do me the favor to put out your tongue. "

"I am wounded, and there stands the assassins," said the Cardinal faintly, while pointing to Spiletti.

"You don't say so," replied Agitato, opening his small twinklers as wide as they would stare, and turning towards the discomforted Spiletti, who, fearing to make matters worse, by a candid confession, informed the two great men that "having been sent for to examine a serious wound, which the Cardinal had just received from the dagger of some unknown assassin, that his Eminence being delirious, had sent a candlestick at his head with such force as entirely disqualified him." -

"We must expect these kind of things in the course of our professional duties," said Stacato, "but seniores priores, bind thy linen kerchief, about thy brow man, and assist us to examine his Eminence's wounds."

His Eminence being exhausted, now uttered a deep groan; some drops were administered; the wound was dressed (no incision having been prescribed by the
CLARA GAZUL. 143
twogreatmen ) after which , Stacato having touched the
Cardinal's pulse, prescribed to let out, by means ofSpi-
letti's lancet, some dozen of ounces of his Eminence's
blood .
Agitato refused his concurrence, his Majesty had en-
trusted him with the life of the Cardinal, and no power
on earth should induce him to consent to such an un
necessary expedient, bleeding was his abhorrence, he
never attacked the vital juices, but where he saw phy-
sical necessity ; it was a bad system, a dirty remedy ;
' it was at best but robbing Peter to pay Paul, putting back an inflamation at the expence of the general constitution. Agitato carried it with a high hand while Stacatio was merely the King's household physician for ordinary services.

Well, then, sighed out Stacato, I bow to the Signor
Agitato's superior skill and judgement ; but as to you
Spiletti, who have received such a heavy blow from his
Eminence's candlestick, if you don't immediately lose
eighty ounces ofwhat the learned Doctor calls "the vi-
tal juice, " you will soon be adead man. Having pre-
scribed quiet, a sleeping draught, and some extracts of
lillies of the valleyto wash his Eminence's minorwounds
in order, as Agitato learned observed , that they might
smell sweet.
The Cardinal, in a faint voice, complained that Agi-
tato's otto of roses would cause him to expire, upon
which hint, vanished backwards bowing themselves out
ofdoors the too great men followed by Spiletti.

## Chapter XV.
A LONG LETTER FROM THE PAGE EUGENIO, DATED LON-
DON, CONTAINING SKETCHES OF ENGLISH CHARAC-
TER IN HIGH LIFE .
THE Cardinal had a good night , and sanguinehopes
being entertained of his speedy recovery his sister be-
came calm. The police, such as exists at Naples, was
on the " qui vive" to discover the deliquents and it was
soon ascertained, beyond a doubt, that aboat having
conveyed two gentlemen to avessel waiting in the bay
ready to sail, they had got out of the reach of detection,
and the wind being favorable, had contrived to leave the
kingdom in safety. The snuff box, which I have alrea-
dy mentioned, was supposed to have been dropped by
one of the party, on the floor of the dining saloon ; on
being examined, was found to contain a beautiful por-
trait of Laura, the Lady Poco- puranti's late protegee.
Whether this portrait had been the property of the green
dominos, or of the Cardinal himself , was a puzzle to
me. The Cardinal denied being the owner of it.
It soon beganto be whispered about that the disguis-
ed brother, and lover of Laura had taken this method of
being revenged on her seducer. The Cardinal was
rich, and gay, and popular, and above all powerful in
Naples, so no one felt inclined to interfere to his preju-
dice, or to pry too closely in to the mystery that envelop-
ed this affair, since his Eminence Poco-puranti shewed
such an earnest desire that the story should be for ever
buried in oblivion.
Not choosing to leave the lady Poco-puranti immedi-
ately after this alarming adventure, I wrote to the Count-
ess ofPolignac to put offmy visit to her for two months,
CLARA GAZUL. 145
at the end ofwhich period, the Cardinal being perfectly
recovered, I took my leave of his kind sister , andwas
welcomedby the Lady Polignac, with the warmest de-
monstrations ofjoy .
On enquiring eagerly about Ligonia and her son, I
was informed that the last accounts she had received
from Russia were from Eugenio's Tutor, who wrote to
say that his pupil's health suffered so considerably from
the coldness of the climate, that after shewing him what
was most worthy to be seen, he had advised him to
leave Russia and travel towards Germany ; that after
visiting various parts of the Continent, he should, at the
earnest request ofEugenio, take a trip with him toEng-
land, the Lady Polignac having been pleased to intrust
tohis discretion, the travels of her child , who would
soon write very fully from the capital of England.
I remember nothing which occurred to me worth re-
lating during the first two months that I remained with
the Countess, who saw but little society. I occasional-
lyheard from the Countess Drognichief, and often from
my nurse ; the former pressed me to join her at Paris,
where she had resided some time, but much as I had
reason to like Rosa, I dreaded the effects of her jealous
disposition .
My nurse, with her husband Albert, had left the ser-
vice of the Count, by whose assistance they had taken
asmall shop at Dieppe, a fishing town in Normandy,
where several of Agnes's relations resided.
One morning when I had been an inmate of the La-
dy Polignac more than four months she handed me the
following letter from her son, dated London, Clarendon
Hotel, Bond- street :
" My Dearest Mother ,
" I have been three weeks in this city, and I delayed
"writing that I might give you some little account of
" our mode of living here. We left Paris towards the
" end of April, and proceeded post to Calais, without a

" lish language, and being provided with money, as well
"as intelligence, why should we not make our way.
"We landed at Dover, after a very short passage,
"and arrived at the Clarendon hotel at about five in the
"afternoon, and having dined excellently well, we pro-
"ceeded , at my earnest request, to Covent- Garden
"theatre. The house was crowded, we were obliged
" to sit in the upper boxes. The salle de spectacle is
"both splendid and neat, though much inferior in all re-
"spects to San Carlos. *
" Having obtained front seats, we were most anxious
"to attend to the stage, but were prevented by two
"highly rouged females, who were continually coming
"into the box and going out of it. At last one of them
"took it into her head to torment poor Monsieur de
"Ville , by leaning on his shoulder, or affectingto stum-
"ble against him and then ask pardon. Annoyed by
"these women, who appeared to be of the very lowest
" class, we quitted the box, and wandered about the
" galleries right and left inorder to examine the build-
"ing .
" Wewere soon followed by our female tormentors,
"who becoming more explicit on the out side of the
"boxes, proposed to us to accompany them home. I
"laughed at them at first till they grew disgustingly in-
" decent, and then I told them in an angry voice (see-
" ing the annoyance they contrived to give my poor Tu-
"tor ) to go to the, devil. They nowbegan to hiss and
" and abuse me, and to crown all, called me "Boney "
" and " Bonaparte. " I opened my eyes at the sound
"of my father's name, but soon guessed that Boney
"must probablybe a sort of bye word among the vul-

"One of our fair companions, a tall strapping hand-

" Help! Help ! you -coward ! -you ' but I
"will not shock you, my dear mother , by attempting to

"Whywill you insult people? whyforceme to forget

" They grew more noisy -one of the boxkeepers in-

"At ten , the next morning, I was led into the presence
" of * * * * * * who is, the fashionable magistrate it
" seems here. The constable who had committed me
" in charge to the watchman stated, ' that his interfe-
" rence had been called for by one of the box keepers of
" Covent- Garden, that two females having complained
" of ill usage from the young Frenchman, who, as they
" asserted, had struck at them, Mr. Roe had taken their
" part, and called the Frenchman a coward for having
" struck at a woman, -that the foreigner had, without
" further ceremony, given Mr. Roe a box on the ear,
" so as to make them, as he should think, tingle again,
" which had so exasperated Mr. Roe, that he would
" soon have finished Monsieure, but for his interfe-
"ence. "
" " And prayyoung gentleman, ' said the magistrate,
addressing me, whathave you to say for " yourself? "
" That my name is Eugenio, that the man who repre-
" sents himselfas Mr. Roe, called me a coward, and
" that I resented it immediately by giving him a box on
" the ears, as I should do again under the like circum-
" stances.
" You have committed an assault Sir, and I am sor-
" ry to see one so young, and a foreigner too, in the
" custody of watchmen -What is your profession or
" business in London, Sir."
" I am on my travels with my Tutor, whom I see in
"the room. We arrived at the Clarendon Hotel last
"night from Dover.
" Hem ! -You were in avast hurry to distinguish
" yourselfmethinks -How came you to quarrel with
"these women ??
" They annoyed and insulted my Tutor, and I push-
" edthem on one side. Mr Roe was then desired to
" stand up.
"" What is your profession, Sir, '
1
CLARA GAZUL. 149
- "، I am afishmonger, '
"Where do you live ?'
"In Covent Garden, every body knows me, I am a
" quiet peaceable young man, unless I see the ladies ill
" used , aud then I can't contain myself. These here
" Frenchmen, you see, are in the habit of treating ladies
" with very great contempt , I assure you, for I have
" been in Paris, and at the Palais Royal, and can tell
"you something about their goings on ; but it won't do
" inEngland. English ladies don't like to be shoved,
" nor pushed neither, in this here land of freedom. '
" ، You are particularly eloquent, Mr. Roe,' said the
" Magistrate, but if you had kept your own counsel,
" you would have escaped a box on the ear, and the la-
" dies would have been no worse than they are now. Do
" youmean to prosecute, Sir ?'
" Why undoubtedly, I must have some kind of sa-
" tisfaction for that wipe of the face, since those med-
"dling box keepers interfered before I could give the
" lad a due and propper hiding for his imperence.'
"" Then Sir, you must put in bail for the assault,'
" said the magistrate, addressing me.
" I replied, that I was a perfect stranger in England,
" where I had not a single acquaintance.
" Very strange, but you have a banker, I presume. '
"MyTutor came forward to say that we brought
" letters of credit on the house of De Rothschild, but
" that disliking obligations, he believed his pupil would
" decline making an application of the sort.
"" Then the young man must go to prison,' said the
"the magistrate, adding, ' that as he was a foreigner, he
"wishedthe matter could be made up."
"Agentleman who had accompanied my Tutor from
" the Clarendon, now came forward, and touching his,
"hat , with much politeneness, adressed me as follows :
" - I live in the same hotel with you, and have taken
" the liberty of accompanying your friend, at the repre-
"sentation ofour landlord, Mr. Jacquier . Will you
150 CLARA GAZUL.
"permit me to offer bail for you. This is my name, "
" added the young gentleman, taking a card from a ve-
" ry elegant little case, and presenting it to me, I read
" the Earl ofRicketty," and presenting my own, upon
"which was written " Monsieur Eugenio," I endea-
" voured to express my sense of his great politeness.
" " Will you permit me then the pleasure of offering
" my bail at once ?" enquired his Lordship, good natur-
"edly .
" With thanks, my Lord, and I will take care that
" you do not have to repent your confidence in a stran-
"ger.
" Lord Ricketty soon arranged the business with the
" fashionable magistrate, who informed me I was at lib-
" erty to depart.
" " Will you accept my arm ?" said his Lordship when
"wegot into the street.
" With pleasure, in halfa second, said I, for I had at
" that moment an opportunity of addressing Mr. Roe.
" Drawing him a little on one side, I whispered to him
" that I was always to be heard of at the Clarendon, or
" at my banker's Mr. Rothschild, and would be ready
" to give him any satisfaction he might require.
" Oh ! we trades people don't fight with swords,
" nor pistols neither,' answered the man, but you can't
" wonder at my not liking to have my ears boxed by a
" child, that I could throw over the lamp post with my
" finger and thumb, as the saying is.'
" What saying ? " Lord Ricketty asked, having just
"joined us ; then turning laughingly towards me, he
" added, in good french, Pray let me settle this nonsen-
" sical business for you Mr. Eugenio. ' You don't ap-
"pear to understand dealing with John Bull- Il faunt
" baisser pavillion. * '
" I have no alternative .
" Mr. Roe,' said Lord Ricketty , turning towards

** the fishman, ' permit me to speak to you as a friend ; '
" the fishmonger here took of his hat, for the condescen-
" tions of Lords to tradesmen in this land of liberty ever
" makes a deep impression. It is a very disageable
"thing to be called a coward as you will admit. '
"" Why, to be sure,' said Roe, scratching his head.
" " And an Englishman's first impulse, on these oc-
" casions, generally promotes him to prove the defamer
" a liar,' continued his Lordship.
" " Certainly, my Lord, that is no more than the truth,
" said Roe.
" Well then Mr. Roe,' his Lordship proceeded, ' the
" best and surest proof this young gentleman could give
" you, that you had belied him, was by venturing to
" serve you as you would have served him, under the
" like provocation. Now if you will say that you are
66
sorry you provoked him, I think he will as willingly
66
express to you his regrets for the whole of what has
"passed. "
" " With all my heart,' said the fishmonger, give us
"" your hand young gentlemen, " dont believe you hurt
" the ladies , so I am sorry I hagravated you, and to
"make amends, I tell you I have heard say that you
" Frenchman can fight like 'limbs, ' when you're warm-
" ed to it. "
" And is that all that is to be said in our favour ? I
" asked laughing, and then added, Mr. Roe, I beg to
" assure you that I am very sorry for the whole affair,
" and particulary, I regret that the conduct of the females
" should have obliged me to push them aside. Saying
" this, I offered Mr. Roe my hand, who gave it a cor-
" dial shake, and we then took our leave of the fishmon-
"ger .
"Bending our steps now towards the Clarendon
" Hotel, Lord Ricketty paid me many compliments on
"myexcellent accent in speaking English. His Lord-
" ship mentioned that he expected some half dozen
"friends to breakfast with him , and invited usto join

" them. My Tutor excused himself on the plea of fa-
" tigue and indisposition, but heseemed to wish me to
" avail myselfof this opportunity of getting into a little
" English society, and as I liked the countenance of my
"new acquaintance, I accepted his invitation.
" Lord Ricketty appeared to be about two or three
" and twenty ; a thin tall stripling with a lively coun-
" tenance, and fine eyes, irregular features, straight fair
" hair, and a pale face. His expressions struck me as
" well chosen, and his remarks shrewd and lively.
" We found only two gentlemen in his sitting room
" on our arrival at the Clarendon, one of whom he intro-
" duced to me by the name of Lord Dolittle, a stout
" man of about forty years of age, with rosy cheeks, -
" the other was a very handsome man, whose counten-
" ance struck me as one I had before seen. This was
" no other person than the Mr. Delford, who, with his
" father, passed some months at Naples last year. Miss
"Clara, saw a great deal of this gentleman when he vis-
" ited the Countess Drognichieff . It was an odd fatali-
" ty mymeeting with him on the second day of my arri-
" val at London. He recollected me the moment he
"heard my name, and having shook me by the hand,
" asked me a thousand questions about Miss Clara Ga-
" zul. We were shortly afterwards joined by the Mar-
"quis ofBoobeedon, and Mr. Kingdomcome, whose
" father is a distinguished personage of very high rank.
" Lord Ricketty did the honors with grace and easy
"politeness. The conversation ran on evening parties
"women of the town, horses and curricles. None of
"these subjects amused me, so I sat still and eat my
"breakfast. I dare say they thought me a very heavy
" stupidyoung man, which I could not help, as I really
"don't know how to affect to feel an interest about sub-
"jects that bore and tire me.
" Lord Dolittle good naturedly tried to draw me out .
"Do you promise yourself much pleasure from your
"visit to London ? he asked、
CLARA GAZUL. 153
" A great deal my Lord, ' said I, there is, in fact,
" nothing I more ardently desire than to make myself
"
acquainted with, than the commerce, laws, and poli-
" tics of England ; that is to say, in as greata degree
" as time and my capacity will permit.
" Lord Pickle, who had just shewn his handsome
" face at the door of the apartment, and was taking off
" his gloves, said, ' You're all too scientific for me, what
" are you prosing about,? " then observing that I was a
" stranger ; I beg pardon, I thought I wasto meet with
"no one but our old set. Lord Ricketty presented
" me to Lord Pickle, who addressed me in excellent
" French, asked me when I left Paris, and if I knew any
" of the actresses, named a great many to me, and de-
" clared he hated them all.
" " Why the deuce do you visit them then, said Lord
" Dolittle, his mouth full ofroast partridge.
"" Visit ! Hem ! Why what is a man to do in such a
" blackguard place as Paris ? I go to half a dozen of
" these nasty things, sometimes of amorning, for the
" vice and viciousness of it. I am naturally vicious :
" there was a man wanted me to calla young fellow out
" for having said at a large party that I was an unparal-
" leled libertine ; butjust the contrary, I asked him to
" dine with me. '
" I will tell you what, Pickle, ' said Colonel King-
" domcome, afat, fair, jolly handsome man, who seem-
" ed to be bursting out of his tight coat, ' you are below
" par, Pickle, you must reform.'
" You be d - d,' said Lord Pickle, whose grace-
" ful person, had struck me with admiration, until he
"opened his mouth.
،،، I wonder I never met you in Paris, ' said his lord-
" ship, who seemed to have takena liking to me.
Did
"you ride about much? -Is itlong since you was there ? "
"I am aNapolitan, I replied, although I studied at the
" university of Paris .
" I wish you would not talk about your studies, ce

" n'est pas recu in this country ; what has a handsome
" fellow like you to do with study, and d bother of
" that sort ? Fencing is the only thing to study. You
" fancy we Englishmen know nothing about fencing,but
" I have done something in that way to distinguish my-
"self in Paris. I wont ask you if you can fence I am
66 sure you can . Youhave a fencing face, -What a
" nice light rider you must be ! How much do you
"weigh ! Which do you like best the French seat on
" horseback or the English ? I don't despise a French
" seat, I assure you. It is different from ours, but it has
" its merit. Do you know the Mount Diables ? Good
" roues and they ride hard ! Eh ? -but you are an Ita-
" lian, I had forgotten. I was a long time in Italy , and
"made a fool of myself there, about an old woman !
" don't you hate old women, eh ! youngster ? -Why
"don't you speak ? Tell me, eh, youngster, why don't
" you speak ? Tell me what you like best ? What are
" you dumb ? I am sorry to see you sulky, little fellow,
" because I had taken a liking to you. '
" Me sulky ! my Lord, not I, it is the first accusa-
" tion of the kind I ever met with. It struck me that
" your lordship was in want of a good listener, and there-
" fore I tendered to you my ear, inhopes of making my-
" self agreeable .
" Lord Ricketty laughed, and gave me a look of en-
6
" couragement ; ' you are a pretty fellow to quiz one
" in this sort ofway, " said Pickle.
• Why you did not give Mr. Eugenio time to get a
"word in for the last quarter of an hour,' said Lord Do-
" little, adding, Do you get grouse in Italy, Sir ? What
" do you think of ours ? It is better than this in the north
" ofEngland. I told his lordship that I thought the
" English kitchen delicious, particularly after having
" fasted so long. This remark occasioned Lord Rick-
" etty to relate my adventure of the morning. Lord
" Pickle laughed heartily at my having proposed to have
" an affair ofhonor with a fishmonger. The Marquis
CLARA GAZUL 155
"of Boobeedon here opened his lips for the first time,
" and with a condescending air of protection, said, gra-
"ciously smiling, ' It was a capital mistake you made
" Mr. Eugenio. '
"True my Lord, for I knew not till to day that En-
"glish tradesmen were ignorant of the use of arms.
" And suppose this were not the case, who would
" measure his good sword with a fishmonger,' enquired
" Colonel Kingdomcome affectedly.
" I would have done so this morning, I replied, ad-
" ding, that I had no right to boast of ancient descent
"myself , being a mere " enfant trouve, " who waen an
" infant, had been found tied in a basket at the door of a
" great Cardinal residing in Naples.
" ، Afrank confession, ' observed Lord Dolittle, open-
" ing his eyes, as if he did not know what to make of me.
" " Why, it may be all a hum, for any thing you know,
" master wise acre,' said Pickle then turning to me and
" observing that I reddened, he added, I am onlyinjoke,
" you don't suppose I would wish to offend you ?"
" I take it for granted that you are too well bred, my
" Lord ; but I must seize this opportunity of informing
" my noble entertainer, that I am in truth'un enfant
" trouve,' with this advantage over the greater part of
66 my fraternity, that all mypecuniary wants have been
" liberally provided for by my parents or friends, who-
" ever they may be.
" ،Money makes the mare to go,' said Lord Ricket-
66
tywith abow, and agood natured smile. Mr. Del-
" fordhere came forward to speak of me and my pro-
" gress in literature, in the most flattering terms, and
"waspleased to say of me that I was considered a pro-
" digy at school. He also related what he had learned
" in Naples; namely, that Bonaparte, when he visited
"the college, had bestowed on me his portrait as a
"mark of his approbation.
" Oh ! Ho ! was Lord Dolittle's exclamation.
" Ha ! Ha ! was Kingdomcome's ejaculation.
156 CLARA GAZUL.
"Pooh ! pooh ! was Lord Boobeedon's indefinite
" remark, uttered with a sneering expression of the
" mouth which looked as if he would have been ironi-
" cal if he had known how.
" Lord Pickle whistled, which was as muchas to say
" " fiddlededee,' or ' bah ! ' while my entertainer, with
" friendly warmth, proposed his services in any shape
" which might be agreeable to me.
" " He would, ' he said, ' take me into the gallery, of
" the House ofCommons to hear the debates, introduce
" me to Lord Munby, who had written several light
" works, and was rather clever, and he would take me
" with him to the Opera, that very evening, where I
" should see all the world.
" We shall have no chance with the women when
" Mr. Eugenio shows his face, drawled out the Mar-
" quis of Boobeedon.
"" None on earth, we must hide our diminished heads,
"' ponhonor, ' said Cononel Kingdomcome, glancing
" towards the looking glass .
" He thinks himself the handsomest man in Lon-
" don," said Lord Dolittle, who was rich, married, and
"privileged .
"Breakfast being at length concluded, we all took a
" walk through the fashionable streets. When we got
" to Charing Cross, I observed the statue of a man on
"horse- back. It struck me as a decent performance,
"but it was placed so high, that it was impossible to ex-
"amine it accurately. In answer to myenquiries Lord
" Ricketty was kind enough to amuse me with the fol-
"lowing anecdote out of which my Tutor might find
"matter for a moral ofdiscourse on the uncertainty and
"vanity of all sublunary things.

## Chapter XVI.
SHEWING WHAT BEFEL LUARA.
I WAS summoned into the dining saloon, a short time
after the above letter had been received. " Is your name
Gazul?" enquired an elderly female, whose face was
concealed in a hood.
Upon my answering in the affirmative, she requested
me to accompany her to the celebrated Convent of St.
Lorenza, which was situated a few miles from Naples,
acquainting me that I should there meet with an old
friend, who had just entered her noviciate, and was in
deep affliction. I enquired her name, but was informed
that particular reasons rendered discretion necessary,
and that I must, therefore, endure suspense, until I ar-
rived at the Convent.
The Countess of Polignac having permitted one of
her male servants to accompany me, I presented my-
self at the grated parlour of the Convent. The Lady
Abbess soonjoined me and, after the usual compliments,
conducted me to her own private apartments, where a
young lady, as pale as a corpse, arose from the sofa and
threw her feeble arms about my neck.
I gazed on her palid features with doubt and aston-
ishment.
" Have you forgotten me?" she asked.
It was Laura ! but how dreadfully changed ! she was
an absolute skeleton, and her eyes seemed fixed as in
death. I burst into tears .
"Your poor friend is much changed, " said the Lady
Abbess in a tone of commiseration.
Miss Laura is indeed changed, I replied, but under
your kind protection, she will, I trust in Heaven, soon
recover.
CLARA GAZUL. 159
Laura now sunk on her couch, exhausted with the ef
fort she had made, to embrace me. The Lady Abbess
easily prevailed on me to pass a few days with the poor
invalid, and the servant was dispatched with my excuse
to the Lady Polignac. After advising Laura to open
hermind to me, the Lady Abbess left us together.
As soon as we were alone, Laura begged me to sit
close to her, as hervoice was feeble. She wept bitterly,
and seemed so agitated , that Iprevailed on her to post-
poneher communication to the following day. In the
mean time, I strove to divert her mind, by conversing
on such general subjects as could have no power to re-
call the past.
The Lady Abbess visited us in the evening, and invi-
ted me to sup with her. I slept in the room with Lau-
ra, whose sleep was disturbed by fearful dreams, from
which she awoke more agitated than refreshed. We
breakfasted on the following morning at a very early
hour, after which Laura finding herself somewhat calm-
er, commenced the relation of her sad adventures in
about the following words:
" You may remember, Clara, that the Cardinal Poco-
puranti's attentions to me were ever the most delicate
and flattering. Already impressed with a high opinion
of his beauty and merit, I soon began to think of him
with a degree of romantic tenderness which I mistook
for the mere respect due to his superior qualifications .
How have I hung upon his words ! How graceful
seemed to me his language ! How noble, yet pleasing
the lofty expression of his fine countenance !
"The goodbut imprudent Signora Poco-puranti, his
sister, encouraged our frequent tetes-a-tete with a view
that his Eminence should instruct me in my religion,
andprepare me for my first communion. Each day my
passion increased, and I began to look forward to my
destined marriage, with dread and disgust.
"The Cardinal had not yet breathed a syllable tome
that might not have been listened to by the whole world ,
160 CLARA GAZUL.
although his eyes were often fixed on my face with an
expression of the most marked tenderness and admira-
tion . As my melancholy increased, the Cardinal's man-
ner of addressing me became more soft and touching.
" One evening when his sister had just retired to her
room, he surprised me in tears -I turned away my head
and held my handkerchief to my eyes.
"Laura, " said the Cardinal, drawing a chair near
mine, " your griefaffects me more than it ought. If I
dared flatter myselfthat you would consider me worthy
of your confidence. "
" I sobbed aloud.
" Speak Laura, dear Laura, tell me I intreat you what
distresses you," said the Cardinal.
" Mymarriage, I replied, my marriage has become
hateful to my thoughts, and surely, my Lord, it would
be a hard, a dreadful fate to be forced into the arms of
one, I feel, I could never love .
" The Cordinal soothed me with the tenderest ex-
pressions that the most delicate friendship could dictate.
I was badly brought up, my feelings had hitherto been
under no restraint.
" The Cardinal soon discovered mypassion for him.
He was a man of luxurious habits, and in the vigour of
life. Opportunities of seeing me in private, were never
wanting .
"Clara , you have long since, I know, guessed the
rest, and I shall not astonish you with confession, that
when I left the Cardinal's protection, I was preg-
nant by him ; " Laura paused , and shed a few tears,
which she hastily brushed from her cheek withher hand-
kerchief , and continued as follows :
"I am descended from one of the noblest and proud-
est families in Italy . My father counted his ancestors
as far back as three hundredyears. Mymarriage with
aCatholic nobleman, whose name I must now forbear
to mention, was decided on between our parents, as
soonas I wasborn. From the hour that Ibecame guil-1
CLARA GAZUL. 161
ty, my forboding heart told me that my fate was fixed in
night.
Iam an orphan, entirely dependant on my brother,
whose lofty pride of birth and natural severity I dreaded.
Yet, I loved the Cardinal with the most devoted passion,
and in our hours ofguilty enjoyment, all was forgotten
but the happiness of the moment. But I was soon to
awaken from my feverish dream of fancied bliss, by
the discovery of my pregnancy ! What nights and days
of bitter anguish did that circumstance occasion me.
The Cardinal was deeply affected at my suffering,
but his reputation was dear to him ; so dear that I fear
he would have sacrificed me to preserve it unimpeached.
" I will do all that a man in my situation can do, " said
the Cardinal, “ to atone for the misfortune I have been
the occasion of; my fortune, my life is at your service,
but not my character, he would say, should that be im-
peached, and if through your means, I see the finger of
scorn pointed at me, Laura, I shall become your ene-
my . " "At these harsh words, I was deeply affected, and
shed the bitterest tears that ever fell from my eyes.
" The Cardinal endeavoured to sooth my agitation of
mind .
"I amrich, ' said he, I will place youout of the reach
of your brother's indignation, and I will pass as much of
my time with you as my duties will permit. '
I listened with avidity to his proposal, for I still dear-
ly loved my seducer, and could not endure the idea of
being seperated from him. The Cardinal Poco- puranti
possesses a most useful and convenient friend in the
poor besotted curate, Father Pietro. This priest is the
dupe of any man who wears the garb of religion ; no-
thing is too extravagant for his credulity ; it would ,
therefore, have been easy to have engaged the poor
man in our interests.
The Cardinal had made known to him his wishes
162 CLARA GAZUL.
with regard to my departure under Pietro's protection,
and a retired elegant cottage was hired for my residence,
at some leagues from Naples. The difficulty which
delayed us was that ofprocuring an eligible female com-
panion, whose discretion might be depended on.
" After much consideration, we had nearly decided
that I should intrust you with our fatal secret, and im-
plore you to be the companion of my solitude. Alas !
my crime was not to remain unpunished. I received
the following letter from my brother on the very day I
hadmadeup my mind to open my heart to you :
Laura,
" " Reports to your dishonour are circulating in Na-
" ples ; to be brief , you are supposed to be pregnant.
" Dr. Stacato, of the King's household, who met you
" at a converzatione, at the Marchioness de la Croix,
" declared in the presence of several of the Royal Fa-
" mily, he firmly believed my sister was pregnant.
" Should this assertion be false, I shall know how to
" punish the calumniator, but if you indeed, have been
" so lost to shame, so forgetful of your high descent, and
66
if you desire that I should not destroy myself , you
" will meet me immediately at .... Hotel, which is
" only three leagues from your present residence, that I
"mayconductyou to a retired Castello, which by inher-
" itance, has long been mine, in order to conceal your
" shame from the world ; your waiting woman may ac-
" company you.
" I suspect the Cardinal ;-if you value his safety-
" if you would not see him weltering in his blood, hasten
66
to meet me, and enter into no explanations with either
" the Cardinal or his sister, but contrive to leave the Cas-
"tello while they are absent.
"I will, on your arrival here, write to inform the fa-
" mily that you are under myprotection -your fate and
" mine are inyour hands.
CLARA GAZUL. 163
" Be obedient, act prudently, and all may yet be
"well.
" " Your distracted but affectionate Brother,
" The Count de LF-."
" On the receipt of this letter my agitation became
so great that it was with the greatest difficulty I accom-
plished the necessary preparations for my departure.
Cruelly alarmed for the father of that infant, who lived
in mybosom, lest his safety might be endangered by my
delay a prey to the most tormenting remorse, I departed
with my woman Esterre, in a hired conveyance, after
having with a trembling hand traced two letters, one
for you, and the other for the Lady Poco-puranti.
I here acknowledge the receipt of the handsome ring
which Laura had made me a present of , with many
thanks, and she then proceded thus :
" My brother's reception of me was kinder than I ex-
pected. He spoke but little on that evening, but as
soon as we had dined, advised me to retire to bed, alled-
ging that I looked haggard and fatigued. I passed a
sleepless night.
" The idea that I should never again be permitted to
see my seducer absorded all my thoughts, and in the
bitterness of my anguish, I preyed to be relieved by
death from my sufferings and despair.
" After breakfast, the next morning, my brother hav-
ing secured the door of our apartment ; addressed me
as follows :
" ، Laura, I will spare you a painful avowal. I know
your situation, and that of the Cardinal was your sedu-
cer !' -I threw myself on my knees at the feet of my
brother. Take pity on me Leandro, befriend your poor
orphan sister, in her approaching hour of trial ! Re-
member she has no protector but yourself .
" " Arise Laura,' said my brother, raising me, ' what
can you have to fear from me your relative ? But there
is no time to loose ; you are, I believe, ina very advan-

is a stake, and the least imprudence or delay will ruin
all.
"We must get rid of your woman Esterre, under
some plausible pretex this very night. '
" Alas ! she is kind hearted and inteligent, and would
be a great comfort to me, said I, while the slow tears
chased each other down my cheek. Imposible, ' repli-
ed my brother, your woman is a Neapolitan. ' Have
you no pride, and would you see your brother a prey to
everlasting shame ? Would you excite him to crimes to
appease his vengeance ?
" Ah ! Heavens forbid, Leandro, said I, be it then as
youplease, I will complain no more. I would I were
in mygrave with myparents, for I am sick of life.
"My brother reproached me for want of firmness
and insisted on my immediately dismissing my favorite
and faithful attendant. We both shed tears at parting.
My brother refused to leave us one moment alone, but
permitted me in his presence, to make ahandsome pre-
sent to Esterre. I saw her depart with a desponding
heart. My brother, soon after her departure, informed
me that he should travel all night, as we had a long jour-
ney to make before we could arrive at the retired resi-
dence, where he had chosen to conceal mydigrace.
" I could only, bow, tears choked my utterance. I
went into my room to prepare for my departure, and as
I was about to tie on my hat, I observed a small letter
pinned into the crownof it , which contained these
words:
"My dearest young lady, Heaven knows with what
"regret I am forced to leaveyou.
66 " I preyGod all maybe well. You have ever been
"the kindest mistress to me, and I would live with you
"inpoverty and sickness, rather than with the richest
" lady inall Italy.
" Shouldmyrespectful and affectionate services ever
" be required , aline to the enclosed address, will be sure
CLARA GAZUL. 165
*" to find me, and I will travel any distance to do your
" service.
" In the mean time, I pray God to preserve you from
" all harm, your truly obedient servant,
" ESTERRE. "
" Agleam of comfort enlivened for an instant myde-
pressed spirits. On perusing this letter , and most grate-
ful did I feel to myaffectionate waiting woman, for this
proofof her regard. Having concealed this letter care-
fully in my bosom, I hastily descended into the sitting
room, equipped for my melancholy journey.
We started at about five in the evening in a close car-
riage, drawn by four swift horses. The weather was
sultry, the postillions accompanied us the whole of the
night. The first time we stopped to change horses
was at a wild looking place, where the horses were in
wanting for us at the door of a hut.
" My brother alighted, but desired me to remain quiet.
I saw him address a man who stood at the door of the
hut, and seemed to have been watching our approach.
They spoke in German, a language I do not understand,
and the stranger often seemed to look towards the car-
riage, so as to lead me to imagine myself the subject of
their discourse. He wore the dress of a Friar, and his
features were completely concealed under his cowl.
" In a few minuets he mounted a handsome bay horse
that was fastened to a tree, when our carriage being
ready, we all departed together. The Friar seldom ad-
dressed my brother, but rode silently by the side of our
equipage.
" I was exhausted towards morning, and intreated
my brother to allow me to alight.
" " We have but three leagues more to travel, ' said he,
' when we shall arrive at a farm, where you may have
adraught ofmilk.'
"Will the father accompany us to the end ofourjour-
ney? I ventured to enquire.
166 CLARA GAZUL.
" Laura , replied my brother, in a stern voice, I
cannot converse with you with temper, so much do I
take to heart your having dishonoured our family.'
"Let us continue silent, or I shall else say what may
wound you to the quick.'
"I sunk back in the carriage with a heavy sigh, and
was silent.
"When we arrived at the farm mybrother had men-
tioned, we were received by a thin old woman, who in-
vited us to enter. She soon served us with milk and
eggs, ofwhich mybrother andmyselfpartook in silence.
The Friar did not join us. In less than a quarter of
an hour we were again on our road. We only stopped
oncemoreduring the whole of the day, and then only
for half an hour, to partake underthe shade of some fine
oak trees, the refreshment which my brother produced
from the carriage.
Towards night, I was really ill, and I assured my
brother that I felt quite unequal to the task of continu-
ing my journey another night.
"My brother seemed greatly discomposed, but pro-
mised that he would alight at midnight. I anxiously
intreated to learn to what place we were travelling,
whilst my brother used every precaution to keep me in
ignorance of our route.
"At last we stopped before a tolerable looking inn,
in a small fishing town. It was, I guessed, about one
hour after midnight. My brother ordered a bed to be
prepared for me, to which he conducted me himself ,
when having commanded refreshments, and seen it
placed on mytable, he left me to my dismal reflections,
locked my door on the outside, and took out the key.
"Alas! What will become of me what means this
dreadful mystery? I inwardly exclaimed ! I could not
eat, and vainly did I endeavour to drown my harassed
senses in sleep .

CONTINUATION OF LAURA'S HISTORY.
" I AROSE unrefreshed, to throw myselfon my knees,
and to implore the Father of all good to give me com-
fort. Vague suspicions of future evilanddangerhaunt-
ed mymind. The sinister expression which my broth-
er sometimes threw into his countenance, made my
blood run cold.
"Oh! that I could escape, I inwardly exclaimed,
throwing up the sash of my small window in order to ex-
amine my situation.
By the light of the moon, I could see that my apart
ment overlooked a modern kitchen garden. Not a leaf
was stirring. Suddenly I heard the distant sound of hu-
man voices . They approached nearer, and I was al-
most certain that two persons were conversing in a low
voice. I hastily darkened my lamp in order to avoid
observation. Two figures now appeared under my
window. These were no doubt my brother and the
Friar who travelled with us on horseback.
"They spoke in a low tone, and it was some time
before myear could catch a syllable of their conversa-
tion. At length I distinctly overheard these words in
my brother's voice.
""I like not our plan -We shall one day, I fear, re-
pent ofhaving fixed upon this Castello. There is dan-
ger in it -Strange things have come to light -What if
they should meet?
" Hush! Speak low,' said the Friar , pointing to the
windowof my apartment.
" She has extinguished her light , and has retired to
her couch,' answered my brother.
"They nowbent their steps onwards, and I lost what

theysaid . Again theypassed mywindow, when Iheard
mybrother address these words to the Friar in an ang
ryvoice .
" If either escape, look to it, that is all I will say to
thee. Thou knowest what thou was't, who it was
who saved thy life, and raised thee to what thou art.
Thouknowest on what our future fate depends ; this
plan is thine own, remember, and that I have ever ob-
jected to it as fraught with risks and danger.
"" What,' replied the Friar in anger, wouldst thou
forego thy revenge ? Shall our hopes and rights be
trampled upon by a viper of the church, and shall we
smile tamely on the iusult and our degradation ?"
"" Be it so then, since the brother countenances the
dishonor of his house."
"" Rather, answered my brother would I with my
own hands The rest of this speech was uttered
in a low whisper which I could not distinguish.
" I was seized with a cold shivering, my heart seem-
edtodie within me, scarcely could I support myself to
my bed, where I sunk down, as I imagine, in afainting
fit .
" On opening my eyes, I perceived that day- light was
fast approaching. Exhausted more from mental suf-
ferings than bodily fatigue, I at length fell into a fever-
ish sleep, from which I did not thoroughly awake until
my brother entered my room, accompanied by an old
female, dressed in the garb worn by the lower and most
abject order of German peasants.
"She placed on my table acup ofwarm milk, a small
loaf , and a roasted rabbit. My brother without inquir-
ing after my health, or remarking my haggard appear-
ance, recommended me to use dispatch, adding, that
ourhorses would shortly be ready for us to pursue our
journey. I would have spoken, but he waived his hand ,
as if to forbid my addressing him, and hastened out of
the room.
"How to account for this cruelty I knew not. My
CLARA GAZUL. 169
brotherhad ever passed in the world for aman ofpious
habits during my father's life time, inspite of the vio-
lence of his temper.
" I lost that dear parent five years ago. His death
took place in Spain, where he had accompanied my
brother, and destined husband, on particular business.
"One month after their arrival at Madrid, I receiv-
edfrom my brother the melancholy news of myparent's
death, which was occasioned as he told me, by amalig-
nant fever, that carried him off in three days.
"My brother had the last solemn rites performed
with regal magnificence, and then took possession of
the large estates to which he was heir. My parent's
ashes were conveyed by easy stages to the family vaults
ofour ancestors, attended by my brother.
"Since the death of my only parent, for I lost my
mother in infancy, I have seldom seen eithermy brother,
or he who was destined for my future husband. I heard
that the strictest intimacy existed between them.
My brother made frequent visits to Spain, leaving me
to the care of an old aunt of my mother's, who resided
near Florence. There I was suffered to follow in all
things the bent of my inclinations. The Governess
provided for me by my aunt, who was almost in her do-
tage, indulged me in every childish whim. I never read
or studied, but at my own good will and pleasure.
" The lady Poco-puranti, was a distant relation of my
mother's. Her goodness of heart promptedher to rep-
resent to my brother, in a letter , the necessitythat exis-
ted for my change ofresidence, since my aunt, from
her advanced age, was unequal to the task of directing
my studies, or instilling into my mind the firm princi-
plesofreligion, which should be my future guide through
life. The Lady Poco-puranti concluded hər letter by
proposing to take charge of me with the assistance of
the Cardinal, until the period appointed for mymarriage.
" Mybrother consented, and requested her toprepare
H

two rooms inher Castello, for the reception of myself
andwoman .
" I had resided, I think, about three months at the
Cardinal's when you, Clara, were invited to be my com-
panion, but I will endeavour to proceed with mydread-
ful story.
"Havinghastily and sparingly partaken of my break-
fast, mybrother led me towards the carriage, that was
waiting for us, whenhaving placed himself by my side,
anddrawn downthe blinds, we proceeded along a rough
unfrequented path at a good smart pace. The heat
soon became intense. I was miserably ill, and my
mouth was parched with feverish thirst.
" I endeavoured, however, to calm myagitatedspirits ,
and determined in my mind that I would make an at-
tempt to escape from the dreaded persecution of my
brother. I was notpermitted to alight again during five
long days and nights that we travelled , save for a few
minutes, and that rarely, in order to obtain the most pres-
sing necessities to sustain life.
" My brother, with obstinate perseverance, refused
to converse with me. He seemed rapt in anxious re-
flexions . Reclined in a corner of the carriage, with his
brow bent, his face half concealed in his cloak, he pre-
served the most impenetrable silence. The carriage
was amply provided with wine, and the most delicate
refreshments .
" The Friar occasionally entered the carriage for a
few hours, to avoid the burning heat of the sunny atmo-
sphere, but I did not hear him utter a single syllable,
neither could I catch a glimpse of his features, so com-
pletely were they concealed by his large cowl.
"At length after we had been a week or more on the
road , we arrived by means of an unfrequented and dan-
gerous path within sight of the strongest and most an-
cient looking castle ( ruin rather) that I had ever beheld.
" Mybrother now descended and addressed the pos-
tillions. I observed that they unharnessed their horses,
CLARA GAZUL 171
whenhaving acknowledged with the most abject appear
ance ofgratitude, the present ofgold which my brother
placed in thehand ofeach , they led their horses onwards
andwere soon out of sight.
" I am then alone, perhaps, with my executioners,
thought I. The thick gathering twilight began to ob-
scure the surrounding rich scenery -the last red flash of
the setting sun , fell on the dark ruinbefore me, and tint-
edthe ivy on it's battlements with a glowing hue.
" " Take my arm, ' said my brother, the ascent to the
castle is rough and steep.
The Friar advanced on before us, and his dark sha-
dowy figure as it was disappearing in the mist of the
evening, added a striking feature to the bold scenery.
"Before we arrived at the gates of this ancient edifice
our ears were assailed by the sound of a heavy bell.
We contrived to reach the moss-grown yard, which ap-
peared to have been recently used as a burial place, by
the poor inhabitants of some adjoining village.
Rude crosses and devices cut out in wood were scat-
tered among the trees. After frequent applications to
the rusty bell, we heard the sound of bolts and bars
which seemed to be withdrawn with much difficulty, and
wehad waited nearly a quarter of an hour, when the
gates were slowly dragged open, with acreaking sound
and ahaggard female stood forward, to invite us into
this dismal abode.
" Never, Clara, shall I be able to convey to your
mind the horror and fear with which this woman's ap-
pearance inspired me.
" She was just passing the meridian of life. Her
heightwas commanding, her features regular, but in their
expression lurked the cunning viciousness of a demon..
"She was thin and haggard, and her dark raven col-
oured locks escaping from the confinement of a redker-
chief, which was bound about her temples, in something
of the German fashion, fell lank and wild about her
face and ears. Asimple short robe or jacket of dark
172 CLARA GAZUL.
grey stuff , was confined at the waist with a yellow rib
bon. Her petticoat had been made ofcostly materials
but the quilted yellow satin was worn thread bare. On
her neck was carelessly fasteneda rich but dirty Indian
handkerchief .
" Something in the aspect of this woman, seemed to
denote that she had seen better days.
" Ye are come at last, ' said the woman in Italian.
She spoke that language with a foreign accent.
"Behind her stood atall gaunt-looking male figure,
habited in agrey smock frock. My brother addressed
the female in German. She made signs to the man,
who I soondiscovered was both deafand dumb.
" With the assistance of a labourer, whom he went in
search of, our equipage was dragged in a sort of dila-
pidated building which probably had once been used as
stabling.
"Whilst the Friar and my brother were occupied
with the carriage and my luggage, the woman, whose
namewas Bianca, with a scowling countenance, beck-
oned me to follow her. I obeyed in silence, my heart
being too full for utterance.
Bianca led the wayup a narrow flight ofwinding stone
stairs, which was so worn and decayed, as to render
our ascent in the twilight dangerous.
"I will go into the kitchen for a lanthorn, ' said the
woman , observing that I stumbled at every step. I
waited her return in mute despair.
"At last she made her appearance, andby the faint
light of her lamp, after ascending the perilous staircase,
I was conducted through a long dark gallery, at the ex-
tremity ofwhich I observed a huge massive oak door,
secured on the outside by aponderous iron bar.
Bianca having with difficulty removed it, we entered
a dismal apartment, the walls ofwhich had the appear-
ance ofhaving once beenhung with curious tapestry,
which nowwas mouldering into dust , and falling from
thewall.
CLARA GAZUL. 173
"This dark melancholy room , communicated with a
smaller one, which presented a more cheerful aspect ;
it seemed to have been recently put in order. The
walls were hung with old portraits, which were
nearly defaced and disfigured by time, but they had
beendusted and repaired.
"At one end of the room stood a bed which had once
been magnificent, but the rich purple hangings were
worm eaten, and corresponded with the pictures. The
bed clothes, however, were clean and comfortable, and
an old couch was placed near a curious antique table,
covered with an embroidered cloth. Afew books and
aguitar lay on a gothic marble slab, and on a buffet, in
a recess, I found tea and coffee service with various tri-
fles that were evidently placed there for my accommo-
dation.
I was growing callous andstubborn from despair, but
at sight of these trifling preparations that evinced a de-
gree ofhumanity in my brother , of which I had began
to think him utterly destitute, I burst intoa violent flood
of tears .
" Andare you thendissatisfied with your apartment
after all the pains that has been taken tomake you com-
fortable,' enquired Bianca sharply.
"I guessed it would be my interest to conciliate her
if possible, I therefore mildly expessed my gratitude
for her attention.
" ، Bestow your thanks where they are due, ' said Bi-
anca , rudely, adding, your brother's will is law here, I
am but his slave, else you might have taken things as
you had found them. Theyhave served me, and might
you. This delicate couch was prepared for my recep-
tion , when I was invited hither. "
"Disgusted with this unfeeling woman, I requested
to be left alone.
You'll have as much of your own company as you
candesire,' said Bianca, and placing my lamp on the
table , she stalked out of the room, but soon returned
174 CLARA GAZUL.
with refreshments of various kinds. Having placed
them on a table, andpointed to abell which hung near
the bed, she once more retired, and I heard her fasten
my door with the iron bar.
It was now that feeling myselffor the first time of me
life alone, and dependant on my own resources, that I
felt mycourage increase with the occasion of its exer-
tion . Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof , ' said I
drying my tears. Let me not despair of obtaing my
freedom.
My first object must be, to preserve my health and
strength. The air struck chill and damp ; there was a
quantity ofdry fuel prepared on the hearth, which I light-
ed, and soonproduced a cheering blaze. I then sat
down to supper with some slight degree of appetite, and
swallowed a glass of excellent spanish wine, from which
I felt much refreshed.
" My supper being concluded, I began to examine
my apartment, I had read of sliding pannels in almost
every romance that had fallen into my hands, but here,
in this old crumbling castle, where they ought to have
abounded, not one was to be discovered.
" Adjoining my bed room to the left, was a dressing
closet, but it had no communication with any other
apartment.
" The windows were so high that it was necessary to
mount on a chair in order to reach them, and when
mounted, I could see nothing but the sky. I had dis-
turbed a quantity ofowls, that now made a dismal noise
about my ears.
"I examined the few books that lay on the marble,
slab. They were chiefly light works, fit to amuse the
hour, written in the Italian language. The guitar was
ingood condition, and there was a music book of old
German romances.
" Vainly did I search for some clue to guide me as to
where I was. It might be Germany, or Spain, I could
nothelpguessing, it was the latter, from various triffling

CLARA GAZUL. 175
circumstance, which during my journey attractedmy
attention.
" The excessive fatigue I had undergone was no lon-
ger to be resisted, and placing mylamp on the table
near my bed side, and arming myself with my supper-
knife, I threw myself on my bed, and slept soundly for
several hours.
" The glare of the morning sun which had penetrated
mybed curtains, at length awoke me. I ventured to
touch the Bell which hung by my side.
"It was answered slowlybyBianca , who brought me
some bread and a cup of chocolate.
"I requested that my trunk might be brought to me.
"The woman merely nodded sulkily, and was leav-
ing the room.
"Staymygood Bianca, said I to her beseechingly ,
stay I entreat you- I am a poor unhappy girl, I am
pregnant , and in three weeks I shall become a mother !
Ithrew myself on my knees at her feet.
"" Such pity as the wolf shews the lamb, shalt thou
and all thy base progeny have at my hands : for know
thy mother was a serpent in mypath : 'twas thy father's
falsehood that stamped these premature wrinkles deep
upon my brow -his treachery that made me the loath-
some thing I am -but revenge! -Revenge has been
mine, and shall be mine,' said Bianca , fixing her dark
eyes onmy face with an expression ofmalice, the most
fiend like and determined, while her vivid lips quivered,
andher whole appearance inspired the most appalling
sensations in my breast.
" Leave me then to my fate, said L , God is all pow-
erful, and mayyet save me, even though men have turn-
ed their hearts against me.
• Bianca darted on me aglance offurious exultation,
and then left me to my wretched thoughts.
" Three weeks rolled away in the same uniformman-
ner.Bianca visited me twice each day, to bring my
mealswhichwere well served . Dreading the sound of
176 CLARA GAZUL
her voice, I had ceased to address her. Myhours were
spent chiefly in prayer to the Giver of all good, that he
would preserve me in my hour of trial.
"I attempted once to strike the cords of the guitar,
andaccompany a hymn with myvoice, that my father
hadcomposed, and taught me to sing in infancy. It was
midnight ! Not a breath was stirring, when me-thought
Iheard the faint echo of foot steps at a great distance,
and then the sound of some one opening a door or the
sash of a window, but all was so vague and distant, that
it might be the owls, or the wind. Again I exerted my
trembling voice, and sang the second couplet of my fa-
vorite hymn. A fine bass voice sounded faintly in the
distance, chaunting the accompaniment in just such
notes, as my departed father's .
"Oft had we sungthe hymn together -I could scarce-
lybe mistaken , yet my ear had only caught a sound,
which was distant and vague .
" My heart beat violently , a mysterious feeling of
rapture possessed every faculty. I suppressed my
breath, removed my hair from my ears, and stood im-
moveably fixed to the spot. Again I thought I heard
the sound offootsteps, and again the last couplet of my
hymn was warbled by a bass voice which resembled
strongly my late father's.
"I never believed in supernatural stories ofghosts or
spirits, yet now when my nerves were weakenedby my
suffering, I almost hoped that the spirit of mybeloved
parent , was permitted to watch over me, to defeat the
fiend- like malice ofBianca.
Howcouldinyfatherhaveinjured this woman? Where
couldhehave known her, and at what period ? All was
afearful mystery.
" Myhour of trial approached, mybrother had not
once visited me, nor had I seen any human being, du-
ringmy confinement, save Bianca and her dumb man,
who occasionally assisted her to clean my apartment.
VainlydidI watch for some expression of kindness or
CLARA GAZUL. 177
compassion inthis man's heavy German features. He
gave me ever but an unmeaning stare. Once I contri-
ved to show him a gold piece, which I held in myhand;
Biancawas employed in the adjoining closet. The man
took the piece, and immediately carried it to her. The
beldame, in a fury, seized my arm, and shook it so vio-
lently, that I was attacked with an hysterical affection,
which terminated in the pangs of labour.
" Have you no surgeon at hand ? I feebly articulated ;
Is there no help for the wretched Laura ? Oh! God of
mercies, what has my seducer to answer for ! and HE
canenjoy existence in the luxury of his palace, indulging
his pampered appetites, while his wretched victim is left
to perish in tortures.
"If , continued I, in a paroxysm ofdespair, throwing
myself on the ground , and raising my eyes to Bianca's
face-Ifthere exist one particle of pity in your breast.
-if you were born of woman, andhope for mercy here-
after, seek out a surgeon ! -Send for my brother! Let
menot perish with my living, but unborn babe. Con
sider I implore you, my extreme youth -scarcely yet
seventeen years of age.
"I was but little older when thy parent destroyed
all my earthly hopes, ' said Bianca, adding with an ex-
ulting smile; ' fear not ! thy brother shall soon attend
thee, neither shall help be denied thee in thy need.'
"She then hastily left the room, and inless than an
hour returned, leading in a most extraordinary person-
age , ofprodigious height, dressed in inared patchedJack-
et ! Sharp misery seemed to have worn him to the mere
anatomy of aman ; the sleeves, of his vest scarcely
reached to the middle of his bony arm; his legs were
thrust into a pair of red worsted stockings, which reach-
edabove his knees, and he wore a pair of old slashed
damask breeches, which had once beenyellow, and on
his head, awretched hat in the form of a sugar loaf .

high, that they nearly concealed his two sharp peering
grey eyes.
""Here is the surgeon of the adjoining village, come
to render thee assistance,' said Bianca, and then, al-
though the weather was sultry, she began to busy her-
self in preparing a quantity of fuel on the hearth.
" Vainly did I assure her that the heat was already
insupportable. All my objections were overruled, and
atremendous fire soon blazed, the heat of which, quite
overpowered me, and I fainted.
Too soon, oh God! did I return to life. My tor-
tures were protacted fifteen hours longer ; my cries re-
sounded through the hall. The miserable doctor trem-
bled from head to foot, and rendered me scarcely any
assistance, although he struck me as possessing both
skill and knowledge in his profession.
"Two figures in black cloaks and masks hovered
around mybed, like the spirits of darkness. The red
blaze tinted the ashy features of Bianca, as she kindled
the flame with demonical expression. My senses were
confused -methought I was in the regions of purgato-
ry. Clara, I must hurry over this appalling part of
my shocking story, or it will even now distract my brain .
Laura's eyes were raised wildly to heaven, her pale
lips quivered. Alarmed by her agitation, Ipressed the
poor weak gırl in my arms, kissed her cheek, and im-
plored her to defer the conclusion of her dreadful tale
till another time.
"" Tis soon told , and I would not, whilst I live have
to recure to it after to-day, " said Laura, and hastily swal-
lowing a few drops, after a pause, she continued as fol-
lows:
" My infant was at length born. I heard his plain-
tiffcry. I saw his little angel form, with all a mother's
joy. My child lived ! HIS child lived, and sweet
hopeentered into my heart."
Laura's convulsive sobs here choked her utterance,
andfor several minutes speech was deniedher.
2
CLARA GAZUL. 179
Saynomore , Laura, let me guess the horrid story,
and spare you the relation of a tale so mounstrous, so
shocking to humanity.
" One instant , and I have done, " said Laura , and
she continued thus :
" Perish the fruits of thy dishonour ! -The shame
of a noble house ! -To the flames with him Bianca !
said a hollow voice , proceeding from one of the masked
dark figures -Oh! mighty God ! ! -The fiend obeyed
spite of the efforts madeby the doctor to preserve the
pure victim. I saw the body of my infant struggling
in the flames and yet I live !!
Laura's voice, in uttering this last expression, was
raised to frenzy ; she tore her hair from its confinement,
and her eyes became fixed for an instant, when she fell
senseless on the floor. -My arms had in some measure
broken her fall . -Trembling, and sick at heart, from
sympathy, with the unhappy Laura, I with dffiiculty pla-
ced her on her bed, and rang for assistance.
The friendly Abbess soon made her appearance, fol-
lowed by several nuns, who, exerted themselves with
tender zeal, for the reliefof the poor novice, who did
not recover till the next day, when she continued her
melancholy tale, in about these words :
" God was merciful to me, and locked my senses in
oblivion, from the instant that the dreadful scene had
struck my afflicted sight. I have no recollection of
what afterwards befel me, for a period ofmore than three
weeks, during which time I lay in a raging fever.
" The first circumstance I can call to mind was that
Iopened my eyes as from a deep sleep, and fixed them
on the venerable face of my departed farther !!
The sight of that dear parent , whom I felt convinced
I had followed to his grave, inspired me with the idea
that I had ceassed to live, and was in Heaven.
"I smiled tenderly and happily in my father's face,
and stretched forward my languid hand for him to em-
brace .
180 CLARA GAZUL.
،،، Do you know me then , my child, ' said the vener-
able figure ?
"Joy, thepurestjoy that ever illumined the face of

ed father !
"Isoon closed my eyes again and obtained several
hours of refreshing sleep. The crisis of my desorder
had passed. Myyouth and constitution had enabled
me to survive the painful ordeal of human suffering.
" Onawakening this time, I saw only my favorite
woman, Eeterre, who sat at her embroidering frame
close to my bedside. What comfort did the sight of
her benevolent countenance afford me !
" Esterre, said I, thank God you are here ; I have
had frightful dreams. I pressed my handto my fore-

I, Donot leave me again Esterre, promise me you will
not, and I paused and cast a frightened look
around the room-But are they gone ? -Will they
comeon no more ? I whispered.
" You are with friends, dear Miss Laura, who will
protect you, but you are too weak to converse, I a few
days you shall here pleasing news : wait only till your
nerves can support it.
My recovery was very slow, but when at length, I
was able to converse, I learned the following particulars
from the mouthof my revered parent, for it was indeed
himselfwho related his story.
" ، Vain would I bury in oblivion the memory of a
son, whose vices cause me to shudder at the idea ofbe-
ing his parent. I cannot , my child, dwell on asubject
so painful, but must briefly give you only the heads of
mysad story.
The violence of your brother's temper, and his
ungovernable pride of birth, you may remember, had
long caused me the deepest affliction. Itwas in the
vain hope of estranging him from a set of profligate
2
CLARA GAZUL. 181
friends, that I accompanied him on atour through Ger-
manyand Spain.
This old ruinous castle, situated on the borders of
Spain, was bequeathed to your grandfather, by the will
of an old and dear friend, who had fought by his side in
various campaigns ; your brother affected to feel the
strongest curiosity to visit this inheritance of mine, al-
ledging that he had heard its surrounding scenery extol-
ledbeyond any in this part of the world.
" Willing to indulge, him I accompanied him here ;
we remained more than a month in the neighbourhood
during which period, we made frequentexcursions to the
castle.
One day we discovered a small narrow staiscase
which had hitherto escaped my observation. My son
led the way, and I followed. The stairs were steep
andmuch injured by time. I, with difficulty reached
the top, when we entered asmall apartment, the window
and door of which were secured by an iron grating of
massy strength, which appeared to me to have been
newly constructed.
I had time for few remarks, for my unnatural son
ashamed to look me in the face, hastily quitted the pri-
sonhe had destined for me, and having placed the strong
bar on the outside, left the castle to return no more.
The truth soon flashed on my mind. My son, to en-
joymy inheritance,had no doubt, reported me dead.
Here, then I was destined to linger out the remainder
of mymiserable existence. It were needless to dwell
uponmy sufferings, my despair, since my wretched
child has gone to his long account. '
"Is mybrother dead then ? I enquired, in great agi-
tation. My father sighed heavily, and brushed a teer
from his furrowed cheek.
" Leandro is goneto his great account; let us prey
forthe repose of his soul, ' said my father ; after along
pause,he continued thus :
" "Mydismalsolitude was notinterruptedtill noon ,when
182 CLARA GAZUL.
Bianca entered myroom with refreshments, her features
glowed with exultation. Wretch ! perjured wretch ! '
said she, thankHeaven you are now myprisoner. She
appeared on the outside of the grating where she placed
my refreshments. Knowing her fiend -like character,
andhow long she had thirsted to be revenged onme my
heart sickened at the sight of this woman, and I was
silent .
"You will be surprised, my child , tolearn that Bian-
ca was my affianced bride ; I loved her dearly. The
day was fixed for our nuptials, when a circumstance
opened my eyes to the viciousness of her character and
I rejected her with scorn.
"In one year after the discovery of her unworthy
principles , I became the husband of your mother, and
from that hour, Bianca lived but for revenge. She has
twice attempted to destroy me, and contrved to escape.
Formanyyears I lost sight of her , but had reason to
believe that she became the mistresss of a most infa-
mous character, and abondoned herself to such vices,
as human nature shudders to think of . It was in the
midst of her vicious career, no doubt, that my son met
withher, and conceived she might serve his purpose.
" Forsaken by all the world, living only for ven-
geance, she accepted this trust with savage joy. Four
years did I inhabit that wretched prison, during which
time I never saw ahuman being, except Bianca, who
brought me food and books, which were my only solace.
Onenight some few weeks ago, when the air was still,
andnot abreath stirring, I thought Iheard the distant
sound of music, I hastened to throw open my smalllatice.
The sounds, though distant, grew clearer -Was it a
dream, or did I here the hymn which I composed for my
only daughter, my beloved Laura ? My heart thrilled
once more with delight. In a tremulous voice I tried
to accompany the air. Suddenly all became still again
and silent as the grave.
2
CLARA GAZUL. 183
" Tell me, Bianca, ' said I to her the next morning
as soon as she had made her appearance at the grate
withmybreakfast, tell me I implore you, have I not
heard the voice of my child?
"" Thy children shall live to be thy curse, false mon-
ster,' saidBianca. Thy daughter has become the vic-
tim of alascivious priest, andshe is pregnant. -Revenge!
I have thee in my grasp, ' screamed out Bianca trium-
phantly, while her eyes glared on me with such a hide-
ous expression, that I turned from her in horror.
"" A few days after I had heard the music, I was sud-
denly awakened by the appearance of fire and smoke.
Soon the flames mounted to my window. Every in-
stant threatened to crush me beneath the ruins of this
mouldering castle. One side of the roof of my room
fell in with a horrid crash. I resigned myself to a fright-
ful death. The corner where my bed stood was still un-
injured. The floor of my room began to scorch my
feet, and Ithrew myself distractedly on the bed. In
another instant, the floor fell in with me, and strange to
say, I found myself in another apartment unhurt, except
by the shock and a few slight bruises.
"" The room I fell into did not appear to have been so
much injured, and I contrived to open a door to the left,
where I perceived only smoke ; the flames had gone
out, or been extinguished.
"" Some dismal groans now appalled my ear, I totter-
ed towards the spot from whence they proceeded, and
opened adoor on the other side of the room .
" Oh God! How did I survive the awful scene that
presented itself! Three mangled disfigured human bo-
dies, lay writhing in tortures clinging to a few remain-
ing planks!
" Water! Water! cried avoice, the accents ofwhich
still vibrates on my frightened senses.
" " Let me hasten to conclude, I saw myson breathe
his last amidst flames and tortures , the other two wretched beings, were Bianca, and he who was your affianced
husband.
184 CLARA GAZUL
""Ahideous mass of bones and scorched flesh was
shortly all that remained of the three miserable objects
that perished in the flames. Near them stood atrem-
bling ragged wretch who appeared to have escaped un-
hurt from the dreadful conflagration, and to have been
tendering his feeble assistance to the rest. On enquiry,
I learned that he was the village opothecary.
"" Laura, you know the rest, I will not torture your
poor bleeding heart by dwelling on the dreadful scene
which this manhas described to me, but frankly inform
you that as soon as their shocking purpose had been ef-
fected , all three had drank large draughts of strong li-
quors, in order to drown remorse, andgrowing intoxi-
cated, they threw themselves on the floor, andfell asleep.
The fire that had been kindled for a dreadful purpose,
being scattered far and wide, had caught the dry wood-
enfloor.
"It was the poor apothecary, who saved your life,
my child, at the risk of his own. You were insensible,
and on account of the heat was removed to a more dis-
tant apartment. He sat watching by your side, and
whenthe flames burst forth, he carried you through the
scorching apartments, and placed you in this wing of
the building, which the fire has completely spared. He
attemptedafterwards to search for Bianca , and the other
two hardened wretches, but before he could discover
them , theirbodies were nearly consumed by the flames.
" "After my son had breathed his last with his vile
associates, the apothecary led me into the left wing of
the castle, and throwing open the door of a large apart-
ment, shewed methe form of mybeloved child!
" " Reclined on an old couch, as pale as death, I ad-
dressed you by the most endearing epithets ofparental
affection , and pressed you to my heart. You appeared
totallyunmindful of my presence , your eyes were fixed
-your cheek was chill and clammy .
Idispatched the apothecary onvarious errandstopro-
cureyou such comforts as you stood most inneed of .

Iknow not how to do justice to the indefatigable zeal
of this poor penitent man, by whose aid you were soon
rendered comparatively comfortable. Adecent village
girlwas procured to nurse you, a small temporary kitch-
en , furnished with necessary utensils, to provide our
meals ; good bedding, and almost all the comforts your
melancholy situation required, were soon procured by
this indefatigable man , bymeans of some gold pieces
which I happened to have about me. The poor fellow,
whose future wants I shall provide for, prescribed for
you with skill, and your fever gradually abated.
I forgot to mention the circumstance, of having dis-
covered among your papers, which had escaped the
flames, a letter from your late waiting woman, contain-
ing her address at Naples.
"I procured an active youth from the next village to
ride night and day in search of her. He returned ac-
companied by your favorite Esterre, in ten days.
" You were still insensible. Your disorder for some
time defied the skill of the most learned of the faculty,
which we could procure from the adjoining towns, Your
removal was pronounced dangerous until your disorder
should turn.
"I need not tell you what joy my heart felt when at
length I heard you call me by the endearing name of

" Here, " continued Laura, " ends my parent's ac-
count of himself . Myreasonbeing completely restored ,
it was my earnest wish to retire to aconvent from an

than elsewhere.
"My father procured every necessary for our jour-
ney , andby short stages , acco accompanied by thepoor
apothecary, who had been furnished with means for a
new equipment, we arrived at Naples, where he placed
meunder the care of the lady Abbess, andtook a tender
leave of me, but not until he had obtained my promise
to live under his roof , and be mistress of his house, as

soonas I should, insome measure, recover myserenity.
In the meantime, myparent is occupied in arranging
his embarrassed affairs, which my brother had left in
such disorder, that ruin must have ensued, had he not
been so awfully cut off by the very means whichhe him-
self employed for the perpetration of such a diabolical
and dreadful crime."
Laurahaving concludedthe melancholy story, wasso
exhausted, as to be quite unable to utter a single word
more, during the remainder of the evening.
Her health, however, gradually improved, and in a
few weeks, she looked considerably more like her for-
mer self .
I remained with her six weeks and when I left her, she
was in daily expectation ofjoining her parent, who lan-
guished for the society of his only child.
Laura only once ventured to mention the Cardinal
during my residence at the convent. On that occasion
she trembled violently, and could scarcely trust her voice
to utter his name, for she still adored her seducer, while
the consequences of her crime had been so appalling,
that she considered herself as a wicked wretch who could
only atone for her past life, by devoting the remainder
of it to religion, and the performance of acts of charity.
" Should I survive my only parent," said Laura, " to
this convent will I return to lay my bones ; -but I can-
not forsake my father. I will, therefore, devote my time
tohis poor tenants, and divide my fortune among the
aged and the sick.
Ipressed poor Laura in my arms, and bedewed her
pale cheeks with mytears. -I May we soon meet again,
dear Clara , " said she, " something whispers to my heart,
that we shall be e're long, united to part no more.
Sheuld tho world illuse you, and if you would enjoy the
calm of religious retirement, remember your poor un-
happy friend Laura , who will receive you with open
arms, and ," continued Laura , blushing deeply, while
taking a letter from her pocket book, "I have fixedmy
heart onhaving this letter delivered to the Cardinal : I

present it toyou open, that you may first make yourself
acquainted with the rectitude of my intentions. "
If I live, your letter shall be placed in the hands of
your late guardian, Laura, said I, and now, may Heav-
en preserve you.
Againand again we embraced each other ; and but
for the sound of the last bell for vespers, we had not par-
ted even when we did, so much and tenderly had Lau-
ra's misfortunes, endeared her to me, and so warmly
did she court my society.
The Countess of Polignac having sent her carriage
for me, I was no sooner seated in it, than I perused the
letter intrusted to my charge for the Cardinal Poco- pu-
ranti, it ran thus :
" Anselm,
"I write to bid you an eternal farewell on earth.-
"Bright as fairy dreams were once my waking hopes.
" You were appointed the guardian of a child, and you
"betrayed your trust.
"I adored and respected you above all human beings,
" and when your counsels might have led me up to
"Heaven, by the sweet pathos of virtuous friendship ,
" you preferred the indulgence of your own appetites, at
" the risk of never ending shame and remorse to me.
" Some indignation I have since encouraged towards
"you, for that you have changed my dreams of happi- .
" ness to black despair ; but my heart would fain now
" be reconciled to you. Could you have but guessed
" the appalling fate you were preparing for your wretch-
"ed victim and your offspring, you had turned from
" such guilty iudulgence with horror: let me die in this
" hope and in this belief . Let no malice or indignation
" live in our hearts towards each other.
" My feeble parent totters towards the tomb of his an-
" cestors. I shall e're long take the veil , and turn my
"back for ever on the busy world. Dead shall I soon
" be to its joys, its bain, and bustling strife.
"Cut off in the bloom of my youth from all earthly
" enjoyment , I shall await death in the calm and reli-
188 CLARA GAZUL
"gious hope that in another and abetter world , Imay
"be permitted to love and live in the presence of my
"God, who will cherish me for my love, and the more
" for its great strength and devotedness -And whenthe
"pang ofbidding you farewell, shall have passed away,
"this world might offer me its most facinating allure-
" ments : You, Anselm, might kneel at my feet, and
" vain would be the temptations you could offer me.
" My poor aching eyes have looked their last on that
"bright countenance, which I have not wisely but mad-
"ly loved .
"When I have seen the fairest and noblest dames in
"Italy , hanging on your words, and living on your
" smiles, when I have known you resist all their facina-
"tions -andwhen I believed you wholly mine, and have
"seen you watch my most trifling actions with anxious
- " impetuous jealousy -then, has rapture too great for
" utterance, beat at my heart.
"These moments still glow in mymemorywithgreat-
" er force, because they have passed away never to re-
" turn . Anselm, your child livedin mybosom ! I heard
"hisplaintive voice! " saw his little hand stretchedforth ;
" and then " saw ******
" Oh ! Father of me mercy receive our little boy !
"Our poor murdered infant ! -and may he rejoice

"Pray , withme, Anselm, for our infant's eternal hap-
"piness and that we may all three meet where no
"WORLDLY INTERESTS or coldness of heart can sepa-
"rate us more.
"" My paper is blotted with the last tears that human
" passion shall wring from my eyes.
"Repent , dearest Anselm, and may Heaven prosper-
you.Adieu! Adieu ! Adieu !

THE Countess of Polignac received me with much
kindness, and shewed me a letter of her son's which had
been received during my visit to the Convent, by a
young college friend of his, who had hended it to his
mother for perusal ; the letter ran thus : -
" My Dear Albert London.
" I was much vexed to learn, by your last letter that
"you are disappointed in your wish to join me in Lon-

" above all things, if only to keep me incountenance

" The English, of all nations, are the greatest slaves

"with a full bottle of excellent wine standing idle at
"your elbow, 'tis treason to touch it, unless you can hit
"upon some man at table who is thirsty at the very

" and quaff them off precisely at the very same instant,
" after making two solemn bows at one another with
" the most serious faces you can well imagine.
" The other day at Lady Raby's, in Grosvenor Square
" being thirsty , I tried to make one bow at her eldest
" son last, for two glasses of wine, but I had no sooner
"poured out the second, and drank it, than I observed
" halfa dozen men at table exchanging significant looks
" at one another, while endeavouring to conceal a laugh
" at my expence. Nothing can be more tiresome to
" me than many of these dinner parties, where half the
" very young men appear to me to be tongue-tied, lest
" they should sin against the most trifling forms ofsocie-
ty .66
"Habit , at length, renders them tolerably easy un-

" as if they dared not wallow their food freely, lest it

" ture of society so little calculated to suit each other's
" tastes. Lord Dolittle, with only three ideas, wine, wo-

" politics, and then the most indecent matter offact ex-
"pressions escaped them, as if to mock at sentimen

"talpassionforthe other sex, which was what they un
"derstood least about . The stupid part of the assem
"bly drank more wine than usual, from being more than
*usually bored until some of them fell asleep. Hav-
" ing , at length nodded away some of the vapours of the
" wine, they arose in confusion, and accompanied my
" Lord Raby to the drawing room. There, the deli
"cious fragrance of the tea, invited us to partake of
" that popular beverage.
" Music was then proposed. The Ladies Rabys
" played and sang indifferently well, but nobody atten-
" ded to them, except Mr. Mediocrity, and his half
" brother, Mr. Atheism, who sang bass, while the for-
" mer beat time or rolled his eyes in rapture over the
" music book ; after which, they sang a duet together,
" making the oddest faces you can conceive, which is
" the fashion in England. But the distorted muscles
" of these two worthy gentlemen, Mediocrity and Co.'
" as they were formerly called, but lately gazetted un-
" der the firm of the Siamese Gentlemen, ' from their
" being inseparables, formed the oddest contrast of gri-
" mace in nature.
" It was a fashionable Italian duet they had attempt-
" ed ; Mr. Mediocrity's tenor face was pathos itself !!
" Most meltingly amorous !! But every body must
"melt inJuly .
" Apropos, I will take the liberty ofdescribing these
" two English inseparables for the benefit of our poor
" Italians, who have not the honour of being acquainted
" with them.
" Mr. Mediocrity is a fat juicy looking man, of six
" feet inheigth, the very emblem of good humour, with
" florid cheeks, and plenty of straight hair. Mr. Me-
" diocrity, to take him all in all, is acompanionable good
" sort ofperson enough, only he wears patterns and
"makes love to every body ; and then he will sing ;

"bemade, let the grimacier present his distorted fea-
"tures to his music book or the ceiling, in order to give
" us, the grimacees, a little liberty for sly laughter; but
"your sentimental singer, and Mediocrity is one of
"these, forces the whole swing of his ugliness on your
" attention, by singing at you, as well as to you, and
"whenhe fixes his melting eyes on your face, there's
" no standing the sort ofthing.
" Now to do Mr. Athesim justice, he never presumes
" to look his hearers in the face, while he is chanting ;
"not enchanting -if he did , andthose hearers should be
" to be ladies, and any amongst them happened to be
" in the way that ladies wish to be who love their Lords
“ ****** but you have read Vathek ; so to pro-
" ceed, Athesim is a neat little man, with a large mouth.
" He possesses superior talents, and the worst tem-
"per inall England. No matter, he is a very honora-
"ble honest gentleman, but his grimaces in singingbeg-
" gar all desciption. Aniece observer might, however,
"tracein his distorted countenance a slight resemblance
" to Wilberforce, methodistically caricatured, or more
" like Neptune's trumpeter, Triton, as he is represent-
"ed in the waters at Versailles.
" One would really imagine that Mr. Athesim had
" been wound up for exhibition by a key, which had set
"the mechanism a going for agiven period, making it
" spout bass sounds that rushed out of his cavern of a
" mouth like a roaring cataract, without in the least dis-
" turbing the bloodless expression ofevery other feature

" The Marquis of Boobeedon having sipped her tea

"I had some idea of it, I replied,but was disappoint-

" toleratedthe Catholics, becauseliberality is the fashion.
" Freedom of conscience is a great matter, and it is
" not enough that the Catholics should hug themselves

"such is fair play ! O'Rioter says so -nay he will
" swear it.
" Lord Ricketty held out his hand to me, and presen-
" ted me to Lord Parliamentary, who having probably
" heard that I was a good boy at school, and learned
" my book, took particular notice of me, and seemed
" anxious to discover by cross questions, to which he
" received the most unsatisfactory answers, whether I
" should disgrace my reputation.
" I was not in the humour for serious conversation,
" and the enlivening opera was not the place to render
"me so.
،، Lord Parliamentary, is desirous of admiring your
" talents , which he knows how to appreciate,' said Lord
" Ricketty. I merely bowed to the young politician,
" and said, I must trust to some future opportunity for
"enabling me in my turn, to admire the talents of his
"Lordship.
" ، I suspect that is a sort ofhit at me,' said Lord
"Parliamentary, with arch good humour, for he was no
" fool to be touchy on such trifling occasions. This
"urbanity made me suspect that I was wrong.

"have beentoo powerful formy youth and inexperience

"jealous, because the ladies Padwell enquired who the
" handsome youth was, who sat in their aunt's Lady
" Rose's box.
" I hope, said I, that you satisfied his Lordship's cu-
" riosity ?
" Not at all, I told him all sorts oflies about you in
" the presence of the Ladies Padwell, who believe, from
66 my representation, that you are descended from the
"highest and most ancient family in France.
" Cela est possible,* said I, alluding to what I had
" before told them of my being, un enfant trouve. †
" Et tres probable meme, if we are to judge from
" appearances,' said Lord Ricketty.
" I bowed low for the compliment.
" Lord Ricketty was conversing with the Duke of
" Paddies, who was soon joinedby Mr. Birch, the great
" counsellor, in company with Sir John Gray. They
" were discussing the merits of a trial for crim. con.
" Sir John spoke well on all subjects, but Mr. Birch's
" shrewd remarks, were so apt -his quickness so strik-
" ing, his method of reasoning on points of law, so trite
" and spirited, that I was delighted to listen to him.
" From crim. cons. their conversation changed to
" political subjects, and being led away by my admira-

" I am proud, exceedingly proud, said the great orator
with rather an awkward bow.
" " This is a Mr. Eugenio with whom I have lately
" become accidentally acquainted," said Sir John Gray
"presenting me to Mr. Birch.
" Your friend is, perhaps, right Sir, said I, in " thus
" hinting that I have no pretensions to the honor I seek,
" unless, indeed, it be on the score of my great desire
" to obtain it, which surely, Sir, argues good taste and
" discernment, considering myyouth.
" I dare not affirm as much whatever may be my pri-
" vate opinion, said Birch, smiling good naturedly, and
" he then condescended to enter into conversation with
"me.
" He spoke of the debates he had himself heard in
" the year 1814 at the Chambre des Deputes in Paris
" -He drew comparisons between the French
" and English parliament, between the English
" charter and the French code of criminal law.
" Lord Parliamentary, eagerly joined in our conver-
" sation. Birch, I found was ignorant on many parts
" of common English law.
" if you were not Mr. Birch, I would venture to set
"you right in this trifle , said I.
" Mr. Birch, assured me he should thank me, adding
" that though less ignorant of common law than many
" people supposed him, yet he was by no means the
" most learned.
" I was master of every subject that was carelessly
" discussed, owing to my memory, which you always
" tell me is prodigious, aided by the habit of reflection.
" Mr. Birch, instead ofmaking me speeches, flatter-
" ed me unintentionally, by eagerly coinciding with me
" and making such remarks, as you are quite right-
" this is a point ofview in which I had not considered
"the subject. We will discuss this matter more fully
"to-morrow , if you will come and breakfast with me. "
" Sir , I replied, nothing has happened to make me
198 CLARA GAZUL
"halfso proud since I came to London, as the notice
66 you are pleased to take of me.
" I never make speaches, unless at Westminster
" Hall, or the House of Commons, ' said Mr. Birch,
" " but I like you -you are very sound -very superior
" indeed, I have seen nothing like you at your age, I
" assure you. " Mr. Birch having bid us good night,
" his friend St. John Gray came forward to make me
" some flattering complaints and offers of service. I
" have heard nothing from your lips halfso civil, since I
" have had the honor lately to become accidentally ac-
" quainted with you Sir, said I, rather ironically.
" ، Mr. Eugenio, you are a very pointed youngman, "
" said Lord Parliamentary, gaily.
" I make a point of pointedly neglecting patoronage,
" even when it is offered me in good time, which just
" now was not a case in point, said I.
"" You think me a very stiff straight- laced fellow,
"then . ' drawled out Sir John; who possesses good abili-
" ties, but that he is such a proud piece of anatomical
"pedantry.
" I bowed my assent with a smile, and a glowing
" cheek.
" ، Well, your frankness is in truth, very comical, '
" said Sir John, adding but come, you must suffer
"me to remind you that I have aright to your notice on
" the same grounds that you founded your clains to Mr.
" Birch's ; for I have the good taste to desire to be-
" come better acquainted with you. '
" You will give a poor foreigner nothing upon credit
" then?
" Why should I ??
"As well ask me why aman should have a good
" heart ? I would answer, because he cannot help him-
" self , and that mine would have prompted me to hope
" and believe you honest until you had given me some
"reason to doubt it ; supposing you had come to Naples,
"and shewnme agood countenance and gentlemanly
" appearance .
CLARA GAZUL. 199
Such as we flatter ourselves -
-- said
* Lord Parliamentary, smiling and looking towards me.
" Certainly, my Lord ! -I was bred a page, et Mes-
"sieurs les beaux Pages en Italie were never remarka-
"ble for their modesty, and if I even had been so, I
" should have thrown aside my diffidence in England ,
"where I don't think it would in a foreigner be appreci-
"ated.
" The fact of the matter is my Lords and Gentlemen
" I continued, that having no claim to the honor of your
" notice, I have determined not to seek it . Whoever
" seeks mine, does me a favour, such as I feel greatful
" for naturally, although instruction is what I come here
" to seek and not fashionable society.
" Why, that is as much as to say, that we are a par-
" cel of asses in the fashionable world, ' said Lord Par-
" liamentary.
" This were great injustice to some of you my Lord,
"and would only be a proofof my ignorant prejudices,
" I observed.
" Lord Clarionet now advanced towards us, dressed
" in a very extraordinary style, half foreign, half crack-
" brained.
"" How do you do,' said his Lordship, laying a
" stress on the word you, and pushing his fingers into
" my chest I wanted you, but you were gone. '
" When my Lord, or from whence ? I asked.
" Why you know, at Lady Rose Viller's there I
"went up to her box on purpose to tell you that Mrs.-
66 What's that woman's name ? I
I mean-
" you know her : I mean that woman with tight shoes
" every body knows who I mean -she wants you to
"dine with her to-morrow -she likes you, I like you
"too, you please me, you please every body only some
" of us are afraid of you ! Did you ever see that woman
" dance at Naples ? looking towards the stage, I knew
"her mother, she had the prettiest little ear in theworld ,
"but she is dead.'
200 CLARA GAZUL.
" I am all ear my Lord, and to nopurpose, for I real-
" ly do not understand halfyou are saying.
" Modesty , modesty, ' said his Lordship, you speak
"English famously -What a dd fool that man
" made of himselfjust now-I never heard such a fool.
" I could make a better speech than that myself , if I
" took time to collect my thoughts-but I have no time
" -time is every thing-ifpeople would sell time, I would
"buy it -nobody would buy so much of it -nobody so
" much in want of it -I have not had timeto eat my din-
" ner to day. What !---Is the ballet over ? Why, I have
"not had time to look at it -I am onlyjust come -the
" House sat late -Good night to you Mr. Eugenio.
" The lady depends on seeing you to dinner to-mor-
" row -Remember that.'
" But her name, my Lord, will you favor me with
" her name ?
"" Good! Good ! very good, ' said Lord Clarionet,
" with fifty merry nods of the head, and without hearing
" my question, he retired.
Fearful of doing a rude thing in this land of etiquette,
" I went into the round room, as it is called, in search
" of his Lordship. He was not there : I found him
" down stairs in conversation with a highly rouged, very
" richly dressed lady. For some time I vainly_expect-
" ed that he would give me an opportunity of speaking
" to him. At length, quite tired of watching him at a
" distance, I ventured to approach him. I beg pardon
" said I, in his ear, but your Lordship forgot to give me
" the lady's address.
" " To be sure ! Certainly ! " said his Lordship ; then
" turning to his neighbour, he said, this young gentle-
"man wishes to call upon you.
" On this hint, the Lady presented me with her card,
" onwhich I read, Madame d'Eperlan, Half Moon
" Street, and then I took my leave.
" I met the Marquis of Goosey, on my way home-
"wards, who had been presented to me that very morn
CLARA GAZUL. 201
"ing. He was hanging on the arm of Lord Yellow-
"mouth ; the Marquis shook me by the hand, and in-
" vited me to sup with his mother, the Duchess ofStrong-
" tower.
" I accepted the invitation.
"" But come with me, ' said Lord Goosey, ' for my
" mother wont sup for these two hours.
" I agreed.
" At the door of the Haymarket, my Lord Yellow-
" mouth was addressed by several frail fair ones.
He
" answered each with rather tender politeness, and en-
" quired if he had ever been so happy as to have met
"them before. "
"" No ! No ! No! they each exclaimed, but Lord
" Yellowmouth, after examining their countenances ,
" appeared incredulous. Alas, you are too charming
" to be so easily forgotten, he said to one; -to another,
"your name is Louisa, and there is the picture of Mr.
"Wilberforce, hanging up in your bed-room, in Upper
" Norton Street; and to another, I saw you once in
" Crown Court, next to the tooth drawer's, you have got
" a back parlour and a parrot ; --and you are-address-
" ing amincing carrotty female in long stays -Yes , I
" see you are Lucy of Sadler's Wells .
" " Lucy, my dear, did not I meet Lord Wordwax,
" coming out of your attic, the last time I called ?
" As I cut rather a foolish figure, hanging on Lord
" Goosey's arm, listening to these lisping vestals of the
"Haymarket in Diana corsets, I now contrived to give
" their Lordships the slip-I met them later at her Grace
" of Strongtower's, who invited me to dine with her on
"the following day, but I answered that I was, as Lord
" Clarionet had led me to believe, engaged to some la-
"dy in tight shoes.
""All an excuse, you are ashabby fellow, and want

" not the Lady's card where you are to dine to-morrow.

-stopped short also, and vainly attempted to
" smother a laugh, out ofrespect to the Dutchess, who
" is, I am told, the proudest woman in England.
" I eagerly begged to know what was the matter with
" them all, that they were afraid to pronounce the name
" of the lady I was to dine with in Half Moon Street,
" which was D'Eperlan. Here the laugh among the
"young men at table became general.
" The Dutchess seemed to pity my confusion ; the
" other ladies appeared to be, or they were really, unac-
" quainted with the name of d'Eperlan.
" You know, of course, that she is the most notori-
" ous old procuress in London, " whispered Lord Goo-
" sey, in my ear, in a tone of reproach.
" I am sure heknows nothing about it, " said Lord
" Yellow-mouth, with prompt good nature, adding,"
"Mr. Eugenio is the last personin the world to want
" tact or delicacy ; " Qui est-ce qui t'a donnee cetta
" addresse mon ami ? " asked his Lordship in French.
" I understood and felt his benevolent motive for tu-
" toi-ing me, whom he scarcely knew, in this moment
" of my extreme embarrasment, but grateful as I felt,
" and anxious as I was to explain matters, I could not
" endure the idea of naming Lord Clarionet, who per-
"haps, hadmeant me only kindness .
" I was led to believe my invitation for to morrow
"came from a respectable qurter, said I, or I.
" " Of course, ' interupted her grace, we cannot doubt
" it , and immediately started a new subject.
" After supper, Lord Yellow-mouth took me to the
"Opera House to look at the masks, before we retired
" if you prefer going to mother Eperlan's I'll accom-
"panyyou, " said his Lordship.
CLARA GAZUL. 203
" I seized this occasion of enquiring more particular-
"ly about the fame of this unknown lady, and he con-
" firmed fully what Lord Goosey had said of her.
" Just as I was leaving the Theatre in disgust at
" what I saw offighting women and drunken heroes, I
" observed Lord Clarionet.
" Calling him aside -My Lord said I, you brought
" me an invitation from a Lady to dinner.
" " True, true, mind you are punctual ; by the bye, I
" forgot to tell you her name ; but you know her, of
"course, the bishop's wife -Lady" - Lady-

" To be sure, Lady Augusta Vernon :

" could not refuse your request to be made known to
" D'Eperlan when you applied to me for an introduc-

" My Lord, I applied to you for the name of the lady
"where I was to dine, and you gave me this card, which
" I shewed to the Dutchess of Strongtower.
"" Good! good! very good, " said Lord Clarionet,
" laughing.
" My Lord you have not known me long enough to

"with passion.

## Chapter XIX.
THE COUNTESS POLIGNAC JOINS HER SON
LAND-I ENTER THE FAMILY OF THE
DE ST. BETISE .
IN ENG-
MARQUIS
Soon after the receipt of this letter, the Countess of
Polignac, who almost adored her son, formed the reso-
lution ofjoining him in England in the character of his
aunt. She kindly invited me to accompany her, which
I declined, for several reasons ; and I, at length, accept-
ed the pressing invitation of the lovely Marchesa St. Be-
tise, after taking an affectionate leave of the Countess.
The Marquis St. Betise, was so overjoyed at seeing
me arrivedwith myguitar, that he could not eat his dinner.
" The Signora Gazul will honour me with her opin-
ion of my new opera ," said he, " the first representation
takes place in a few months. All the great singers are
engaged ; all Naples will be there and Tantini takes
the first part !! " Saying these last words, the Marquis
couldhardly contain his rapture.
The Marchesa was reclined on the sofa and appear-
ed in very delicate health ; she was pleased to express
her satisfaction, and great joy at having me for a com-
panion . Afterdinner, in thecourse of conversation, I happened
to mention the young Prince Orazio, who had perform-
-ed Telemachus. I soon discovered that this was a for-
bidden subject, by the deep blush that overspread the
Marchesa's cheek, and the hurried manner in which her
husband answered for his lady.
The noble Palace ofSt. Betise, was full of visitors,
and the Marchesa, made me manyapologies for the ne-
cessity she was under oflodging me for a few days on
206 CLARA GAZUL.
ly with one of her women in a large double bedded room
- " She was your fellow traveller, however, said her
Ladyship, and therefore may be less disagreeable to
you than a stranger. "
One evening passed off, I thought pleasantly , with
the aid of some excellent music, and at a late hour I re-
tired with Fanchette, the little bold repasseuse, who my
readers may recollect was my fellow traveller from Ly-
ons to Naples.
" Mademoiselle, your most obedient, said Fanchette
how happy I am to meet with you again, "
I asked her how she liked her place ?
" Oh Signora, said she, " there has been rare doings
here since we last met ; you must have seen that my
lady fell over head and ears in love with the young
Prince Orazio, on the night of her grand masquerade ;
-Every body saw how things were from the beginning
except the good husband, who gave his Highness a gen-
eral invitation to the Palace. Oh ! to see how my lady
would hang on his words, and watch his every movement.
She is two years older than the Prince, and much sly-
er, still I am inclined to think she was virtuous up to -
the time she saw him and for several months afterwards
thanks to the timidity of her very youthful lover. But
she was caught at last, by her husband, in some equiv-
ocal situation I guess, for the Prince was suddenly dis-
missed, and each servant threatened with being imme-
diately discharged, if they ever admitted him into the
Palace again.
" The Marchesa has never held up her head since
and has become as careless and indifferent about her
dress as she used to be troublesome and fastidious. In-
stead of trying on a dozen caps before she could decide
which would best suit her complexion, she now leaves
the whole business of her toilette to me, and sits sighing
with her eyes fixed on vacancy while I fix her bright
jewels, in her beautiful hair ."
CLARA GAZUL. 207
And what has become of the Prince ? I asked.
"Oh ! he went to every party where the Marchesa
was invited, and so haunted and tormented the Marquis
that for the last week he has confined his lady to the
house, refused to leave her for a moment, even to at-
tend to the most pressing business, and what is worse
than all, he has caught his old aunt Donna Diablo, in
the very fact ofconveying a letter from the Prince to his
wife, and now declares she shall never again enter the
Palace."
Is the Marquis really fond of his wife ? I enquired.
" Some doubt that, " answered Fanchette, and she
continued, " it is a positive fact that he intrigues with
èvery maid servant in the house, who will permit him ;
but he is proud ofseeing his wife admired, and more
magnificently dressed than any other lady in Naples. "
The Marquis is very unpopular, andpasses for some-
thing of a coward, besides being vain, purse proud, and
a fool, but for mypart, I have found him a good master ;
-the truth of it is, he humours all my caprices, because
I am the best small plaiter of shirts he ever met with in
his life ; and next to Tantini, his Lordship loves dress .
I have three hundred embroidered cambric shirts under
my care. "
I remarked that the Marquis appeared to me to be a
very well bred man.
" You are right, " said Fanchetto, " but he is an ass
whom nobody cares to know, and many say his new
Opera which he expects is to immortalize his name,
will be damnedupon the very first representation. The
Cardinal Poco-puranti too who is all powerful in Na-
ples, from his immense riches, has taken a dislike to
him. His Eminence regulates the Police, and most
things temporal as well as spiritual in this city. "
Is he not the uncle of the Lady St. Betise ? I asked.
" Yes " replied Fanchette, " her own father's brother
and he loves her with true and pure regard. She is, in
fact, the only person for whom he is supposed to feel
208 CLARA GAZUL.
real affection . By the bye, what a sad story is told of
poor Miss Laura, whom his Eminence is suspected of
having seduced. However mum ! it is a ticklish sub-
ject to speak scandal of this proud and powerful prelate ;
but you are sleepy Miss Clara and I must wish you
pleasant dreams. "
Good night Fanchette, said I, and we both soon fell
asleep.
CLARA GAZUL. 209
## Chapter XX.
THE SUMMER HOUSE .
I BREAKFASTED with the Marchesa by her own par-
ticular invitation, but the Marquis was present ; he was
her very shadow, attending her even to her bath and
dressing room.
She was like many of our Spanish ladies, a very help-
less creature . Her little feet seemed as if they were
never meant to walk upon, and she had no more idea
of putting on her own clothes, than if she had been de-
prived of herhands . -True, she could manage to touch
a few chords on the guitar to assist her song, but love
alone could have made her an actress .
At this time, the Marchesa was about nineteen years
of age, but from her infantine manners, she would have
been guessed younger. There was much dignity in
her shy reserve, and although naturally artful, yet was
she religious in her way, and both feared and respected
her confessor.
Under the semblance of genuine innocence, or high
bred apathy, she possessed desperate passions, for the
indulgence of which she had courage also to risk even
her existence. But the Marchesa, now mourned in se-
cret penitence, her dereliction from virtue ; yet the charm
had proved irresistible and now that she was deprived
of her lover, life became a blank.
I often read in the Marchesa's expressive eyes, her
impatient desire to accomplish a tete- a-tete with me, but
for more than a week the thing was absolutely impossi-
ble. Perhaps I ought to have left as soon as I had rea-
son to suspect the sort of confidence which she was in-
clined to place in me.
Alas ! I have many other faults to answer for , and I
210 CLARA GAZUL.
may here in extenuation plead the deep interest I felt
towards this beautiful lady, also that her palace was the
only respectable home that was now offered me. True,
I had money, thanks to the kindness of Ligonia, and
might have joined my nurse Agnes at Dieppe, but I had
never travelled alone, and to a Spanish girl such a pro-
ject was truly formidable.
Imight also have obtained a safe and honorable asy-
lum in the convent of St. Lorenza, but I had no predi-
lection for the monotony of a convent, since Laura had
left it and gone to join her aged parent.
In short, right or wrong, my inclination prompted me
to remain where I was .
Spite of his zeal for watching his wife, the Marquis
de St. Betise's health at length required that he should
take exercise, and as his better half declaring herself too
unwell to accompany him, he was obliged to leave her
in charge of her own honor , after laying the strictest in-
junctions on his porter to admit no one in his absence.
As soon as the entrance gate had closed upon the
Marquis, his lady invited me to her closet, when with
many deep blushes, and in the most painful confusion,
caused more by her natural pride, than innate virtue ;
she told me " a round unvarnished tale, " of , how she
adored the young Prince, how vainly she had struggled
against her passion ; when, where, and how his High-
ness obtained the first kiss of love she had ever bestow-
ed on man ; the second, the third, and so on progres-
sively. How did the beautiful Marchesa's eyes kindle with
the fire of that passion which was consuming her, and
which she so feelingly described. - " Clara," she con-
tinued, " take pity on me and be my friend ; I am a
wicked wretch, who have been false to my marriage
vow. Toyou, and you alone, I have confessed so much
-married at fourteen to the Marquis, whom I never
loved, my virtue has been too weak to resist the extra-
ordinary attractions of that dear Prince, for whom I
CLARA GAZUL. 211
would die a thousand deaths -Clara, I must -I will see
Orazio, once more.
Impossible, my dear Marchesa, for Heaven sake do
not think of it : consider the dreadful consequences that⚫
may ensue : certain death to him whom you profess to
adore, for surely the Marquis would stab your lover to
the heart if he were to make another discovery.
" We would both prefer immediate death to living
for ever separate, " said the Marchesa, while her lovely
cheeks were bathed in tears . She drew from her bosom
a letter from the Prince, which her convenient woman,
Fanchette, had just delivered to her: and at her request,
I read as follows :
" LEONORA,
" Your beloved Orazio, implores you on his knees.
" Do not condemn him to self destruction.
" Let us renew these dear and delicious moments of
"perfect happiness, where your head has rested on my
" bosom, your heart has beat against mine, and you
"have, in thrilling accents of love, sworn to be mine
" only, and for ever mine-And you are gone from me
" Leonora ! Your angel countenance shall beam on me
" no more.
" Oh! how sad is my heart. I feel myself withering
" in the very morn of life, consumed by fever-I shall
" die, cruel Leonora, my passion is destroying me.
" I am very ill -nightly do I wander round the dwel-
" ling where my love sleeps calmly ; but no, no, she can-
"not rest, when her love is a pray to black despair.
" I humbly thank you for all your tender letters, but
" Leonora, your next must tell me when and where we
" shall meet.
"Did you seek the love of a boy of sixteen, but for
"his destruction? And can you leave me ?
" By Heavens, if I thought so * *
*
*but no !
" I will for yoursake curb the hatred I bear towards your
"persecuter, your cowardly * ***
212 CLARA GAZUL.
"Forgive me Leonora, I know not what I say.
"Where, and when ? In mercy tell me, lest I go
"distracted. " ORAZIO. "
Have you answered this letter? I asked, after peru-
sing it.
" Yes," said the Marchesa, blushing, and in the deep-
est confusion, " I have promised to be in the small sum-
mer house, which you know, is about half a mile hence,
to-morrow evening as soon as it is dark. "
And the Marquis !
" He, I know, must be absent, on urgent business-
Clara , will you accompany me ?
Tis hard to refuse you, but I dare not, nay, I will not.
" Then I have no friend on earth," said the poor in-
fatuated Marchesa, bursting into tears, and sobbing
aloud.
My dear Marchesa, I am but a weak and young ad-
viser, but fain would I deter you from a project so dan-
gerous : consider how unaccustomed are ladies of our
nation to wander alone. What will, what must your
domestics think and say among themselves ? What, if
the Marquis was to arrive? His road lies past that very
summer house ! You will then endanger the lives of your
husband and lover, for a moments gratification.
66 I'll hear no more," said the Marchesa, in apassion,
stamping her little foot, and holding her ears . " I want
no sermon from you, Clara-Betray me if you will I'll
meet Orazio if I can ; I'll run all and every risk, but I
knowyou will not betray me. "
Dear Marchesa I
" No more," interrupted the Lady, " I was mistaken
in you, let the subject rest ; favor me, if you please, with
a little music, handing me her guitar. And glad enough
was I to change the current of her thoughts, since I saw
that all prayers, such as I had wit to make, would not
alter her fixed resolve.
CLARA GAZUL. 213
TheMarquis left his palace in his state carriage, ear-
ly on the following evening, on a visit, as he affirmed,
to one of the Royal Family by appointment; the Mar-
chesa then invited me to her dressing room: she was
violently agitated.
Fanchette was employed in arranging her beautiful
hair. Her Ladyship found many faults ; examined
herself in the glass, eagerly asking me if she did not look
very pale ; would wear a cap, then snatch it from her
head in disgust, and preferred her hat and feathers, then
hercap again.
" Mais qu'avez vous Madame la Marquise ?*" said
Fanchette, in a pet.
The report of agun was heard at some distance.
The Marchesa let fall abeautiful small round look-
ing glass which she held in her hand. The palpitation
of her heart was visible through her stays.
" 'Tis an ill omen, Madame la Marquise, " Fanchette
remarked, whilst picking up the broken glass.
" No, No, I will not believe it," said the Marchesa,
and her smile was radient with happiness.
How brilliant was her beautiful Spanish countenance,
at that moment !
" I prefer the blue cap after all, " said she, " Quick !
Quick! Fanchette, hastily throwing off the one that
had just been placed upon her head ; and in her eager-
ness she dragged out the large comb that fastenedher
profusion ofhair, which now fell loose and long below
her waist.
" Mais quelle maniet ! exclaimed Fanchette, par
example ! It will take half an hour to settle all that hair
again. Surely Madame, the Marchesa must be mad
to night.
The Marchesa put her two pretty little hands togeth-
er in the attitude ofbeseeching, " Fanchette, ma bonne

† What folly.

vois tu-cette jolie robe ? c'est pour toi mon amie. " *
Fanchette thus encouraged, sat about doing her best,
Mais en grace donc tenez tranquille votre petite tete un
instant ma belle dame, "† said the abigail.
In another five minutes Fanchette was dismissed,
and the Marchesa wrapped in her large Indian shawl,
went out at the little lattice gate, which led to the sum-
mer house, that was built on the top of a steep hill .
Whilst I was musing on the danger to which this
lovelybut guilty woman thus exposed herself , Fanchette
tapped me on the shoulder, and whispered in my ear,
"She is gone to meet the Prince. "
Are you sure of that? I enquired.
"Quite," replied Fanchette, adding, "It is too laugh-
able to think of the pride of Marchesa, seeing that I am
her only friend. Yet, although I carry on their corres-
pondence with the assistance of Old Diablo her aunt,
she is not frank enough to acknowledge her faults and
she trusts me only when she can't help it.
" I would have accompanied the poor little woman,
whose feet have scarcely ever pressed the ground ; I
wouldhave protected her ; -How is she to find her way
this dark night ? you heard that gun go off , Mademoi-
selle, it was fired by the Prince to announce his arrival
to his mistress . If the Marquis catches them togeth-
er he will surely murder them both. "
Heavens forbid, I exclaimed, and now I began to re-
proach myselffor having refused to accompany this poor
deluded young woman.
What am I, I reasoned, that I should presume to act
the prude ? What should I have been but for the no-
ble generosity of my lover ?

Ever the creature of impulse, I flew up stairs for my
hat and cloak, and hastily bent my trembling steps to
wards the summer house.
I was approaching very near it when I heard hasty
foot steps close behind me. Turning my head, I saw
by the light of the moon , which was just emerging
from a thick cloud, the tall dark plume which adorned
the hat of one of Prince Orazio's Chasseurs,
"Where can Mademoiselle be wandering so late ?"
he asked civilly.
I was in great confusion.
The Chasseur observed to me that a storm was
gathering, and advised me to lose no time in returning.
Before I could reply, the sound of horses hoofs were
distinctly heard.
"Mon Prince voici le Marquis, " bawled out the
Chasseur, in great trepidation, running towards the sum-
merhouse.
The door was spedily opened, the Marchesa threw
her arms about her lover's neck, " Let us die together,"
said she.
The young Prince eagerly searched for his dagger.
" Prince, " said the Chasseur, " remain where you
are, the Marquis will scarcely visit the summer house
to - night.
" Yes, yes ! he comes on purpose, else, why is he on
horse back, instead of journeying down the straight
path in his carriage," exclaimed the Marchesa .
Not an instant was to be lost, only one path led to
the house ; the storm was rising -The Marchesa, who
scarcely knew how to walk, could not possibly have got
home in time, and then the rain fell in torrents. The dis-
order of her dripping garments must therefore, have be-
trayedher.
"Hasten onwards," said I quick ! " and I will detain
the Marquis, Hide ! hide, for an instant for he comes,"
I continued in a wisper, and in another minute, I had
taken possesion of the summer house The Marquis tap-

forced the lock, and I stood like a guilty thing before
him. " Mademoiselle Gazul !! How came you here ? Is

Iheard the voice of a female on the outside of the

the noise of her foot steps.

## Chapter XXI.
I RECEIVE NEWS FROM MADEMOISELLE ST . SAUVEUR
-WHO IS ENAMOURED OF A NOBLE COUNT -AN-
ECDOTES OF THE MARQUIS ST. BETISE.
I DID not seethe Marchesa till late the next morning
when she appeared exhausted and truly unhappy.
In a fewdays more, the Marquis grew tired of keep-
ing his wife at home, and insisted onher attending all
the routs and parties, to which she was daily invited -I
usually accompanied her ladyship, and we met the
young Prince Orazio every where. His Highness was
somewhat changed in appearance, since I had first seen
him; he was taller and paler, had a slight cough, and
appeared consumptive, but his beauty, if less brilliant,
was infinitely more touching.
How he would sit and gaze on his mistress whom he
was not permitted to address ! How soft were her glan-
ces when directed towards him.
The Marquis was a pacific man by nature ; he flew
inapassion one night , nevertheless, at the Cardinal Po-
co- puranti's concert.
" Impertinent young coxcomb was his audible excla-
mation , uttered between his close teeth as we stood
watching the young Prince. The fire of indignation
flashed from the bright eyes of the youthful Orazio, but
he had swornto his beloved to give the poor Marquis,
carte blanche, to a certain extent, and he curbed his ri-
singpassion and changed the fiery expression of his an-
ger to that ofcontempt. The Marquis ordered his carriage, and we all three drove home in perfect silence. I
could not envy the matrimonial tête-à-tête which I knew
awaited this unhappy pair.
Thenext morning after I had quitted the breakfast
222 GLARA GAZUL
room, there was a regular scene ; some of the house-
hold actually afirmed, that the Marquis struck his wife,
but this I doubt. The man was soft and civil by nature
and his wife was so fragile ! However, he was sorely
provoked, and there was much sobbing and hystericks
on thepart of the distressed Marchesa.
At length, the Cardinal, her uncle, was sent for, who
reproached his lovely niece with such severity, that she
fell into a sort of fit, when the frightened Marquis sent
for Doctor Pastoral.
Doctor Pastoral declared that the fit was produced
by the Marchesa's high wrought sensibilities, acting on
her nervous system which was delicate as the web of a
spider. That her Ladyship must console herself for
these little accidents with the reflection, that the more
delicate the nerves, the more exquisite the feeling, &c.
&c. Thus encouraged, her Ladyship had a second fit.
The Cardinal became now so alarmed as actually to
advise the Marquis to allow his poor sick niece to see
her lover once more in his presence The Marquis
was absolutely beside himself , for these fits, were not
altogether make believe. The Marchesa's health and
nerves were much disordered, that is the truth of it, and
when she had got into a fit, she could not recover so
soon as she might wish. At length the Doctor was
dismissed and the Cardinal spoke to her so eloquently
against the crime of incontinence, that the Marchesa
sent for her confessor, and to the joy , of her tender
spouse, promised to be guided by his spiritual advice.
After this hurricane, there was adead calm, and no
more quarrelling between the noble pair for more than
amonth. If , during that month the lovers contrived to
correspond, they certainly never accomplished ameet-
ing . Aboutthis time, I received several letters ; one from
the Lady Polignac dated London full of friendly pro-
fessions. She described her dear sonEugenio, as be-
ingveryhappy inEngland ,and informed me that he
CLARA GAZUL. 223
hadundesignedly made a conquest of abeautiful young
Lady, the only daughter of a nobleman ofmuchtalents ;
was the favourite of the great Mr. Birch , and admired
byevery one.
My second letter came from Mademoiselle St. Sau-
veur, who was still residing with the relative of Doctor
Lambert. Herhealth, she informed me was perfectly re-
stored, and she gave me to understand that she had fal-
len in love with ayoung noble Neapolitan, who visited
at the house, which was situated in the most lovely ro-
mantic retirement, in a rich country, some thirty leagues
from Naples. Her friend, Madame Lambert, she de-
scribed as a very rich fantastical old woman, who still at
fifty and upwards, hoped to pass for young, by the help
ofcosmetics and every art that could possibly be ima-
gined -Part of Mademoiselle's letter ran thus :
" My friend, Madame Lambert, is kind to me, but I
" am anxious to consult my dear Clara, and to learn her
"candid opinion of my noble lover. Our first meeting
" was truly romantic.
" I lost my way in the large forest , which is situated
" only two miles from our residence. As night approach-
" ed, I became dreadfully alarmed ; suddenly hearing
" footsteps close behind me, I fainted ; and on my re-
"covery, found myselfin a smallhut reclined on a mat.
" Anoble looking young man, richly dressed, stood
"watching my countenance, with an appearance of ten-
" der interest.
" Where am I ? I eagerly enquired.
"" Fear nothing, ' he replied , you see me anxious to
"obey your commands. I am the Count Alberto, by
"birth, a Neapolitan, on a visit to the Duke of Almei-
"da's, who resides in this neighbourhood, and wandered
"this evening about the forest , in search of my dog
"Mameluke. Will you give me an opportunity ofbe-
"ingserviceable to you?"
"Encouragedbyhis gentle tones , I explained tohim
224 CLARB GBZUL.
"who I was, and implored him to conduct mehome.
"He was most happy, he said in the prospect ofbeing
" of service to me; in short, he protected me in safety
" to Madame Lambert's who fell in love with him at
" first sight, and during three months that the Count
"Alberto has been our daily visitor, the good lady has
" not remarked that he paid me any court ; but on the
" contrary , she believes that he returns her foolish pas-
" sion for him ," -much more did Mademoiselle St.
Sauveur write, and her letter coucluded with earnest en-
treaties that I would visit her."
After the receipt of this letter , I began to think that
since my advice might really be of use to this young la-
dy , in her present unprotected situation, it would per-
haps be unkind to refuse to visither. -Still I felt a re-
pugnance to the idea, for I could not forget the inveter-
ate hate she had shewn towards Ligonia, not only while
labouring under a dreadful malady but also since her
recovery had been completed.
I determined to defer answering Mademoiselle St.
Sauveur's letter until I had endeavoured to reason away
myprejudices.
My third letter was from Agnes, dated Dieppe. She
wrote in good spirits. Albert , her husband, was still
kind . Her little shop answered well , and they enjoyed
all the comforts of life according to her humble notions,
The Marquis St. Betise gave the most elegant din-
ners in Naples, and for less than half the expence that
was lavished on the groaning tables of the great Cardi-
nal Poco-puranti. His Lordship was an excellent econ-
omist , and regulated the expences of his household with
exact frugality .
Hismancook, in aclean white apron each night at a
given hour, entered the studyof the Marquis, andplaced
the bill of his dinner expences on his Lordship's desk,
at which hour his Lordship never failed to attend, for
the purpose ofexamining the said accounts, and affix-
-
CLARA GAZUL. 225
ing , if correct, his, " rubrique apostillee. " The cook
might then present it to the steward for payment. In
like manner, was the said artiste's bill of fare placed
everymorning at an early hour on his Lordship's table ,
with the market prices of provisions in general, when
his Lordship would write opposite the chosen art icles
thewords "pour deux, " " pour dix," " pour cinq ,"* &c.
&c. according to his notions of sufficiency, and his
judgement andtaste in these important matters were per-
fect . There was seldom a dish to spare at his table, and
yet there was always what was most calculated to excite
the appetite, and to encourage it: all was piquant, deli.
cate, and recherche.
In short, had the good Marquis's taste in music been
equal to his judgment in the art of domestic comfort,
joinedwith economy, he would not have been banished
from the land of his forefathers, by order of his Holiness
the Pope. But I must not anticipate.

AHUSBAND DUPED -A CUNNING PRINCE-AN IMPAS
SIONED MISTRESS GROWN DESPERATE.
" Он! la jolie petite Espagnole qui demande apres
vous, said the Marquis St. Betise one morning to me.
I was surprised. His Lordship in answer to my en-
quiries informed me that he had met the Lady at the
grand entrance and heard her enquire for Mademoiselle
Clara Gazul alledging that she brought her a letter from
some of her relations at Madrid.
I almost dreaded to hear from myunfortunate mother ,
whom it was not in my power to love or respect. Pity
for her vices was the mildest feelings I could encour-
age towards such a parent, and therefore, as long as she
continued in affluence, I desired to be forgotten by her.
I could not, however, avoid speaking to the young lady
who had called on me.
On entering the small reception room, into which she
had been politely invited by the elegant Marquis, avery
tall young lady, whose face was covered with a thick
black veil, made me a low, but rather awkward curtesy.
Her dress was strictly Spanish, yet she spoke to me in
French. She appeared in great confusion, andmade
memany unintelligible apologies, for intruding, plead-
ingunfortunate circumstances, unlucky stars, miserable
privat ons. &c. &c.
Itook out my purse -Can I offer you any relief
Mademoiselle? said I -Theyoung ladyshook herhead,
and appeared to suppress a laugh with difficulty. I
begged her pardon for the mistake I had made, and en-
treated to know her motive for favoring me with a visit .
"Guess, said the Lady throwing aside her veil.
*Oh! the pretty little Spanish girl who is asking afteryou.-ED.
CLARA GAZUL. 227
I was puzzled : -Somewhere I had seen such ſea-
tures, but could not call to my recollection where or
when . " I doubt really Mademoiselle our having ever
met -and -yet -but it cannot be surely you cannot
bethe-
"I am that unlucky fellow, the Prince Orazio, " said
his Highness, throwing himself on his knees
"You will not surely have the cruelty to betray me
Mademoiselle, you do not desire mydeath."
Prince, said I , with some indignation, I feel myself
really insulted -I was proceeding, when the door open-
ed , andthe Marchesa having fastened it after her, flew
into the arms of her lover. And now my sermons or
lectures on decency, honor, &c. might as well have
beenmurmured to the wind, or to empty space for any
good effect they would have on the enraptured lovers,
who seemed almost expiring withjoy. So finding my-
selfa mere cypher, in this trio, I was withdrawing, and
had laid hold of the handle of the door, when the Mar-
chesasuddenly recollecting her very critical situation,
seized my hand and implored me to invite the Prince
into my own bed room.
Lady Marchesa, I am really astonished at thebold-
ness of your request .
"But we are desperate, " said her Ladyship, and she
now led the way towards my bed - room followed by the
Prince.
Madam, I will not -I cannot , said I, as we passed
along the corridor -here I paused, for at that moment
wecame in contact with the Marquis de St. Betise,
who was running all over the palace, looking for his
wife .
" Ou vas tu ma petite ?*" said his Lordship to his
wife, who spoke very little Italian.
"Mademoiselle Gazul was too ceremonious to ven-
ture to invite her friend, who requires repose to her own

fore-
Mon Dieu mais pourquoi non *?" interupted the
Marquis. Monsieur le Marquis, c'est quet; here I paus-
ed -Could I betray the lovers, and thus, perhaps, be
the cause of their death ? believing as I did that the
Marquis would not scruple to bury his dagger in the
breast of the Prince -Impossible.
I fear -I fear -was all I could articulate.
C'est moi qui aura l'honeur de conduire votre belle
amie , said the gallant Marquis, and thus relievingmy
embarassment, he offered the Prince his arm with a
graceful bow.
It was with awe and maiden-like trepidation that the -
amorous young Prince, venturedto lean on the Mar-
quis, who having conducted her along the corridors to
my little boudoir, presumed at parting, to press his lips
on his Highness's fair hand.
Andnow that we are alone Prince, said I , after the
Marquis had retired with his lady, and closed the door
on us, I must frankly inform your Highness that you
have taken an unwarrantable liberty with me. The
Prince acknowleged his fault , and while he stood trem-
bling and imploring my pity , Fanchette shewed her
head at the door, and beckoned me to follow her. I
obeyed .
" The Marchesa desires to speak toyou in the draw-
ing room, directly, " said she.
Onentering, I found her ladyship examining some
music, with her husband-" Clara, " said she, " this
opera is so beautiful, that I wishyou would sing the
songs in it . I havebeen telling the Marquis that you

Really your Ladyship is too
"Mademoiselle Clara," interrupted the Marquis, " I
am charmed to hear that you admire my new opera, and
have done me the honor to study my best songs, I am
all impatience, " and he handed me my guitar, and open-
ed the music book.
My Lord, I must reallybe excused , I really
Oh! que vous etes cruelle, mais mon Dieu Madem-
oiselle vous savez combienj'amie la musique, et vous
me refusez ! -Ordinairement vous etes si, complai-

To be brief , his Lordship would take no excuse and
whilst I was accompanying my guitar, her cunning La-
dyship glided out of the room, and went to join her lov-
er unperceived by the enthusiastic Marquis, who was
beating time to his own melodies, with all the energy of
his soul.
Our music lasted an hour, at the end of which period ,
the Marchesa returned to us.
" Il est parti " -whispered her Ladyship in my ear.
* Oh ! How cruel you are ! But my fair Lady you know how
passionately I lovemusic , and you refuse to sing -generally too

## Chapter XXIII.
ALBERTO -IS HE A BANDIT ?
THE next morning I told the Marchesa, that it was
my intentionto leave her, -She burst into tears, and at
length obtained my unwilling promise, to remain with
herjust as long, and no longer than her conduct should
be free from reproach.
She was ingreat affliction , her dear Prince was dy-
ing. The fever ofjealousy and passion was consuming
him. He had caught cold on the night they had met in
the summerhouse by returning home in the storm, and
his cough was increasing. " In short, " said the Mar-
chesa, " we shall soon be in our graves, if we continue
separate. "
I said what I could to comfort her, and endeavoured
to open her eyes as to the weakness and wickedness
she was guilty of . She listened to me this time with
patience, and seemed to wish to acquire a command
overher headstrong passions.
" If Orazio was happy I could endure my sacrifice, "
said she, and then intreated me to talk to him. I could
scarcely avoid smiling at the idea of mybecoming the
monitor of the young amorous Prince. We were inter-
rupted by Fanchette, who carried it with a high hand at
the Palace St. Betise, and excited no small degree of
jealousy among the household, by the influence she had
obtained, as a sort of factotum in various branches and
departments.
She was prima dona in the laundry, and the Marquis
would almost as easily have submitted to part with his
second best fiddle as have been deprived of her, excel-
lent smallplaiting of his shirts; and then the poorguil-
tyMarchesawas in her power, and ,therefore forced to

humourher, However, in justice to Fanchette, I must
observe, that the girl, though an intrignante, was not
quite a monster, and she really did feel something like
attachment forherhelpless mistress ; which said feeling
she had evinced with warmth and energy in those mo-
ments when she believed the Marchesa's life was in
danger from the violence of ajustly offended husband,
whohad been heard to say, that he would stab his rival
to the heart, if he should find him again in his wife's so-
ciety , an actnot very unfrequent in Italy, under the like
provocations.
"Why ladies you will not be dressed for dinner," said
Fanchette, " and dont you know that the handsome and
mysterious Count Alberto dines here to day? -He is to
be presented by the Cardinal Poco- puranti. Every
body is dying to see him for he seldom remains at Na-
ples for more than a fortnight during the whole year,
and can rarely be prevailed on to go to parties. The
few ladies , however, who have met him, have so turned
the heads of the rest, by their description, that not a
Signora in Naples, married or single, Who would not
be ready to travel to Rome to get a sight ofhim. "
" I have not the least curiosity ," said the Marchesa,
sighing languidly.
Is not Alberto the name of the celebrated chief of
Banditti that justice has so long and vainly been seeking
for? I asked .
" The name to the very letter, " said Fanchette, " and
what is more mysterious still a Lady (Signora Loren-
za,) whose carriage was attacked some two years ago
by a party in masks, declares that the person of one of
the robbers, was strikingly beautiful, and reminded her
of the Count Alberto, who is to dine with the Marquis
to day. "
So he is of ancient family ? I enquired, while Fan-
chette was assisting the Marchesa to dress.
"Ohye, his patent of nobility has been closely in-
spected, his credentials are clear and satisfactory, and
232 CLARA GAZUL.
he is really and truly the last and only descendant of the
noble family of Alberto, a family famed for their high
courage and feats in arms. "
What are the mysterious features of his character ?
I asked, and was informed that some few years back
Alberto, somehow or other, became an object of suspi-
cion to government.
Fanchette knew not exactly why ; probably his fre-
quent and continued absence from the place of his birth ;
the richjewels he wore, whilst it was known that his es-
tates were mortgaged to the last shilling, might have
excited some curiosity, at least , enough to have led to
further investigation, at a moment when Alberto the
robber sought for with such diligent activity as scarcely
ever did lazy Italian police exert on any former occa-
sion.
To proceed, opportunities are easily discovered or
fabricated in Italy , to arrest an individual who has be-
come the object ofvague suspicion to the government,
buthowever that might be, Count Albertohad been con-
fined several months, when after the closest and most
scrutinous investigation, no proofs to his prejudice had
beenmade, and he was ofcourse acquitted.
Itwas in the course of this investigation that his pat-
ent ofnobilityhad been examined, and proved genuine.
Many nobleman of high rank came from Rome and
Florence as witnesses of the Count. All these alledg-
edthat theyhad met him at various courts in Germany,
Spain , and other countries, and that every where they
hadseen him receive the respect that his talents and
high rank had aright to demand. With regard to the
costly jewels he wore, these were probably presents
fromsome of the manyPotentates and royal Persona-
ges whodelighted tohonour him.
He was afirst rate poet , and inGermany,had obtain-
edgreat celebrity for apoem entitled 'Robers and
Soldiers, ' This poemcontained much keen satire, but
ofthat refined and close nature which did not amount
toalibel on the army although it savoured of it .
CLARA GAZUL. 233
Welistened so attentively to Fanchette's interesting
account of the handsome Count Alberto, that we were
nearly too late for dinner, as the company only awaited
our presence to sit down to table.
Glancing myeyes around me they were soon attract-
ed by the very striking person of the Count, who sat
on the left of the Cardinal Poco-puranti. He was a
man nearly six feet in hight, and very graceful as to the
exact proportion of his strong muscular limbs. His
eyes were black, bright, and piercing. Their expres-
sion denoted vast energy, and strong passions. There
was no malice lurking in his smile, which was very
beautiful, from its strong contrast with his usual haughty
cast of countenance, and the display it afforded of his
brilliant teeth. His round full lips vied with the purest
coral. His nose and forehead were formed in the ex-
act contour of Grecian beauty, his skin dark olive.
Thenhis hair was very remarkable, so black and glossy,
hanging about his ears in large decided natural ringlets
so unlike the coffure of any other man at table, that it
would have been deemed coxcombical, but for the man-
ly toutensemble which counteracted its effect. Indeed,
the unstudied attitudes, and the whole bearing of the
Count made one fancy these beautiful ringlets but the
unsophisticated growth of his head, and belonging to
hat peculiar style of countenance which could not have
dispensed with its rich luxuriance without absolute dis-
figurement. His chest was high and deep. Avery
lionin strength and agility as he appeared before us in
the prime and strength of manhood, it had been , abold
enemy that haddared to venture his single arm against
that of Alberto.
I was never more surprised in my life than on being
informed some time afterwards that this hero was in his
thirty fourth year, as no one could possibly have guessed him older than six and twenty. True, there were
visible on his forehead some few lines, but these appear-
ed to be the effect of thought or cares stamped by strong

### Page 234
passions on his brow , and not by age; and the curve
about his mouth had such a character in it , that it must
havebeen always there. He wore no whisker on his
transparent olive cheek, but a profuse moustache graced
his mouth, as bright and black and curling as the riglets
of his head.
His dress was rich, but plain, and instead of cover-
ing his person with pretty gems, like the Marquis St.
Betise, he wore few, in number, but these were so cost-
lyand magnificent that each and every one separtely
would have realized a fortune to the owner. A Tur-
quoise, the largest and finest in all Italy , fastened his
dark velvet cloak, and the briliant that adorned his fin-
ger, had been often valued at ten thousand Rosines ; *
his watch and snuff box were also set in large diamonds
and the hilt of the small rapier he usually wore about
his person , was studded with rubies of rare beauty. It
struck me that, an artist who was required to paint a
chief of Italian banditti in all the glowing beauty that
his fancy could image,and mostin unison with his sub-
jet , would have painted Alberto.
Oh stranger that with this style of beauty he should
also bear the name ofthat terrible chief of robbers who
bad so long infested the Appenines and all Italy. Yet
didnot these strange coincidences, on reflection, carry
with them conviction of the Count's innocence ? Would
the true robber, whose life had long hung by so slender
athread, bodily shew himself at every court with the
style and bearing and real name of the bandit ? Would
he have published a poem, the subject of which was rob-
bers?
In short, I felt , almost convinced that no possible
ground for suspicion rested on the noble looking Count
Alberto, who could be no other than Mademoiselle St.
Sauveur's new lover as described in her letter.
I forgot to mention a story which had got wind among
* ATuscan coinvalueabout sixteen or seventeen chillings ,-En
CLARA GAZUL. 235
the domestics, namely , that the Cardinal had received
some secret instructions from his Holiness, the Pope,
advice rather to court the acquaintance of the Count
Alberto, and keep an eye on him, now that he believed
himself entirely freed from all further surveillance.
However that might be, the Count's manner of addres-
sing his discourse to the Cardinal, was certainly frank,
friendly, and fearless, while that of his Eminence to-
wards the Count, was ceremonious from excess of far
fetched politeness.
" Cardinal," said the Count, I forget on what occa-
sion " Cardinal you are too ceremonious for me even
whenmost at your ease ; I beseech you therefore, not
to go out of your way on myaccount. I am a soldier,
rude, in speech and manner, compared to your infinite
suavity, which does but shame me.
" You have served then, " said the Cardinal disregard-
ing the Count's accusation.
" Aye Cardinal I am an old soldier -too old perhaps
for your taste."
" I have not, I confess, the honour to understand
your meaning Count ," the Cardinal observed.
" Why , we cannot serve God and Mammon ; Is it
not so written in your book, good Cardinal ?"
" We are not met her as mere book- worms but in the
true spirit of free and friendly intercourse, " said his
Eminence, " therefore, permit me to offer you wine, and
they touchedglasses, after which the conversatiou took
amore general turn.
There was a large party invited to pass the evening
with the Marchesa, and dancing as well as cards was
introduced. The Count, tall as he was struck me as
the best waltzer in the room. He danced with so much
spirit and grace, that it was really inspiring, and matrons
of all ages were by him persuaded once more to exhibit
on the " light fantastic toe " even the Marchesa St. Be-
tise, much as she adored the charming young Prince,
could not help admiring the lively amiable temper of the
236 CLARA GAZUL.
handsome Alberto. As for the Marquis, he declared
the Count's feet, in the dance, went as true to the music
as its echo.
" Enfin, " saidhis lordship, holding his opera glass to
his eye, " c'est admirable !" As for the young ladies
who crowded the saloons of the Marchesa, their ques-
tions made to each other en passant , that night were not
according to there usual form, of eloquent address-
"Howdo you do,” but, " Have you danced with the
Count ? Do you think he will waltz with me," &c. &c.
" Mais quelle infame police *" exclaimed the Mar-
quis St. Betise, who was more French than Italian '
" Can one fancy any thing more grotesque, absured,
and outre, that the idea of their having sent to prison
one of the most amiable noblemen in the world. " The
Marquis purposely uttered this sentence which was ad-
dressed to me, so as to be overheard by the Count, as
he approached us for an instant , while in the act ofwalt-
zing gaily with the Marchesa, who growing giddy at
that moment, the Count led her to her husband, and
his grateful thanks for the compliment.
" Count Alberto, " said the Marquis, " I hope we
shall often see you at this palace, and allow me to as-
sure you, that we shall feel disappointed if we dont."
The Count promised to prof it by his politeness during
his short visit toNaples.
"You werejust now complaining of the stupidity of
ourpolice, if I heardyou right," said the CardinalPoco-
puranti ,who was reclined onacanape immediately be-
hindus.
" Theworst organised in all Europe, " said Alberto.
" I am afraid you are right , " observed the Cardinal
" At all events, the Count may reasonably be dis-
gusted with our laws, since they have subjected him to
months ofunmerited imprisonment , " the Marquis ob-
served.
" Let us hold in mind , " said the Cardinal fixing his
*What an infamous police.
CLARA GAZUL. 237
eyeson thecount, " let us hold in mind that Alberto
the bandit, is avery desperate villain , and whenwe con-
sider how long justice has been trifled with, she may,
perhaps, be pardoned, should she at lengthbe forced to
doalittlewrong in the hope and beliefofbeing oneday
enabled to bring many adark deed to light, the culprit
toanignominous death, and thereby agreat and over-
balancing good .
I have really nothing to complain of , " said the Count
unaffectedly, " for I am an odd person, who travel all
over the world, with a large brilliant on my finger , and
dagger beset with rubies. "
"Voyons donc ce petit poignard ? " said the Mar-
quis ; " engrace Monsieur le Comte montrez nous ce
poignard en rubis dont , on m'a tant parle. *"
Alberto as he drew the dagger from his brest smiled
on the Marquis, and the smile said, as plain as it could
speak, " poor civil ass. "
Thedagger was handed by the Marquis all round the
room, but nottill he had himself admired it rapturously
for several minutes.
"Oh the lovely little dagger ! -The delightful bril-
liancy of these rubies ! -They are perfect, and in such
profusion, " exclaimed the ladies.
Whenthe dagger was at length handed over to the
Cardinal, which was not until the females were all quite
tired of it , his Eminence set about examining it so very
minutely, that one would have said he was counting the
rubies, and noting the size and quality ofeach. The
Count , as soon as he had observed what the Cardinal
was about, burst into alaugh, which seemed to be, or
was the effect and indulgence of spontaneous merri-
ment .

"Are you laughing at me Count?" said the Cardinal, laughing also, for he was a man of the world, and

* Let us see this little dagger! - Pray Count show us this ruby mounted dagger which I have so much heard of.

any society .
66HisEminence," answered the Count , "reminds
one ,that is to say, he appears to me to be Taking an in-
ventory of my poor rubies, in order to effect an execu
tion. "
The Cardinal was no fool, He felt that the Count
had read his thoughts, and the discovery caused him
some confusion. The office of a spy must ever be at-
tended with risk and some chance of humiliation, even
when the cause is a good one. Much as the Cardinal,
no doubt desired to see the bandit secured, partly from
goodwill towards the state , but chiefly and more parti-
cularlyon account of his own large property, which was
spread far and wide, and which had been and might be
still more injured by Alberto's desperate band ; yet, so
farfrom feeling any bitterness against the Count individ-
ually, or any wish to find him adepraved character, he
would, I really believe have felt shocked, as far as a
coldmancan be shocked on such occasions, had he
seenjust cause to suspect the gay, and apparently frank
and noble Count of such vices, as human nature recoils
from. As his suspicions faded away, he, perhaps, re-
joiced , that they did so ; while, as a gentleman, he be-
ganto feel almost ashamed of his late doubts, and the
dutywhich had been imposed on him by his Holiness
thePope.
" I owe you no ill will personally, upon my honour, "
said the Cardinal, with unusual frankness, returning the
dagger .
" And why should you ?" the Count asked good na
turedly, " but that you take me to be the robber Alber-
to. "
Oh! quelle affreuse idee, *" exclaimed the Marquis
St. Betise.
*Whatashocking idea ..
CLARA GAZUL. 239
"Howvery ridiculous!! What a fancy! " said the
ladies , all speaking and laughing together.
The Cardinal was a gentleman, andperfectcandour
was now the only chance agentleman had of getting
out of such a scrape.
Itis myduty and my wish to ascertain, ifpossible,
and beyond all po sibility ofdoubt, that you Lordship's
not the bandit, " said the Cardinal in a loud hurried
voice, as though his courage, had been screwed to the
emergency with some difficulty.
"Par exemple, c'est un poco trop fort , " said the Mar-
quis who was apt to mix up French with Italian inmo-
ments of unusual irritation.
"Not at all Marquis, " Alberto replied, I am sorry,
truly sorry, that you see it in that light : -' The Cardinal,
your noble relative, is doing his duty. "
" I will have no inquisitorial investigations under my
roof ," said the Marquis " et je declare moi, que son
Eminence prend trop sur lui -enfin je declare ici que
le Cardinal Poco-puranti m'a insulte ce soir ,*"_here
the little Marquis struck the table forcibly with his hand .
The Cardinal reddened, but fearful of compromising
his dignity, answered nothing to the Marquis, and mere-
ly desired a page, as he passed, to order his equipage.
"Beautiful and noble lady," said Alberto, eagerly
addressing the Marchesa St. Betise, " I have a boon to
ask -your uncle loves you, make up this foolish matter.
" Willingly will I strive to do so" said her Ladyship,
and then she joined the Cardinal, who was taking hasty
strides about the room.
" My dear Marquis, " said Alberto, in answer to his
elegant host who was apologizing, professing, protest-
ing, &c. &c.
" Oh monsieur le comte, " said the Marquis bowing,
and pressing his hand to his heart.
*And I declare that his Eminence takes too much upon him-
selt -in short , I hereby declare that the Cardinal Poco- puranti
has this evening insulted me.

"Hadyou my noble host , Isayconsulted your judg-
ment it would have told youthat the person who bears
the name of a terrible robber, dresses after the fashion
of a bandit, wears costlyjewels without stating whether
they maybe the gifts of the Pope or the devil. "
"Tout cela est telement dramatique, ” said the Mar-
quis, "que je vous jure quej'en ferai un opera. *" -
"Buffa ou serio ?†" enquired Alberto eagerly.
" Mais, Monsieur le Comte c'est que mon fort est

" Diable ! Vous allez me pendre donc ? quelle som-

expression .
"Levoila debelle humeur , " said the Marchesa
dragging forwardher uncle the Cardinal's hand, and pla-
cingit inthat of her husband's, and so the peace was
patched up between Poco-puranti, and St. Betise.

lowedhis example.
