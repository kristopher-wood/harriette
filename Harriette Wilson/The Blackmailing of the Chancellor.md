Harriette Wilson (1786-1845) was neither the first nor the last fashionable courtesan to publish her *Memoirs*, but hers had by far the best opening line: 'I shall not say why and how I became, at the age of fifteen, the mistress of the Earl of Craven.' She kept her promise; according to the 'Confessions' of a slandered rival, Julia Johnstone, the truth was too sordid and too unflattering. But it was about the only promise she ever did keep.

Considering her notoriety, we know surprisingly little about Harriette; and most of that from her patently unreliable *Memoirs*. Her father, John Dubochet, was supposed to have been a Swiss of gentle birth; but both parents may well have been the natural children of English noblemen. At the time of Harriette's birth they were established as stocking-menders in Mayfair. They had a large family and at least three other daughters who followed the old profession. Harriette herself seems to have begun in 1801 at fifteen. Then for more than a decade she passed among a dazzling galaxy of aristocrats and nabobs - from Craven to Fred Lamb, the younger brother of a future Prime Minister (Melbourne), from Lamb to the Marquis of Lorne, later Duke of Argyle, and then after many other admirers, including at least two other sons of dukes, Lord Robert Manners and the Marquis of Graham, from

the Duke of Leinster to the Marquis of Worcester. Early in 1812 a younger sister managed to marry into the peerage and perhaps it was this which set in train the idea that when he came of age the following year Worcester should marry Harriette. The young man seems to have been eager enough, but his father, the Duke of Beaufort, was understandably not. He got his son out of the country and came to terms with Harriette over money. From this time Harriette's fortunes rapidly declined. First she took up in London and Paris with a young man called Richard William Meyler. He was the last of a line of Bristol and West Indian merchants, worth, it was said, some £35,000 a year; but suddenly on 3 March 1818 he was carried off by apoplexy at the age of 26 and before he had time to complete his will. Then between 1821 and 1823, Harriette fell into the clutches of the 'Colonel'.

Harriette always had a weakness for soldiers. 'Zounds', a titled proctor once exclaimed after meeting her with two privates, 'if the girl has no virtue she ought to have some decent pride about her; and all this time I have been keeping two huge guardsmen instead of a mistress.' At the time of her first meeting with him, William Henry Rochfort (1795-1852) had seen some service with the artillery in India but he had not the slightest claim to the rank of colonel and was actually roaming the streets on license from the Fleet Prison. Obviously he was not rich, though he liked to tell people that he was by rights an earl and heir to vast estates. Truth to tell he did come of a noble Irish family, but one much inclined in recent generations to family litigation, disharmony, and debt. His father had charged his estates with an annuity for his widow which they were too small to support; earlier his grandfather had ruined himself in a property dispute with his brother, the first Earl of Belvidere. The 'Moustache', as Harriette first called

### Page 11
him, still had high hopes of both connections; but they were pretty far-fetched. His claim to the peerage possibly rested on the well-known fact that the first earl had for many years kept his wife locked up because he was convinced she was unfaithful. But the title lapsed, not on account of any supposed illegitimacy of his sons, but on the death of the last of them in 1814. And if there had been any right of succession through the first earl's brothers, which there was not, the 'Colonel' would still have had somehow or other to dispose of the three who came before his grandfather and in the next generation of the two who came before his father in the order of seniority/ There is in fact no sign that he ever pressed his 'claim'. But he definitely did involve himself in twenty years of litigation in pursuit of what remained of his father's estates.

Evidently Rochfort was a determined man and it seems to have been as much on this account as for his handsome face and figure that Harriette fell madly in love with him. For his part Rochfort was desperate rather than devoted. The assignment of his interest in the estates to his debtors in 1821 had not succeeded in keeping him out of gaol and his hopes of marrying an heiress had also just been dashed. But in spite of his rather contemptuous
inconstancy, Harriette apparently

### Pages 15-16
made a Fleet 'marriage' with him and helped to get him released early in 1823. From the safe distance of Paris they then together hatched their plan for the wholesale blackmailing of the English aristocracy.

Harriette's *Memoirs* were issued in twelve paper-covered parts between January and April 1825. They were an immediate success and the publisher, J.J. Stockdale, had to barricade his windows to fend off the crowd of disappointed buyers. By her own account they were written 'in a sort of shorthand' and rushed off to the printers in daily installments. Sincere there was no time to make any corrections, she was herself surprised that they appeared so well in print. But their appeal was not merely scandalous and they still convey a sort of naive freshness and authenticity. For as she later wrote to the most successful novelist of the day; 'I am very ignorant and can't spell, but there is this advantage in not reading, you are all of you copies and I am the thing itself.' But author and publisher profited also from what they did not print. As each part appeared it carried at the end titillating hints of future revelations and by dropping names invited offers of buying out. To reinforce the point Harriette also wrote round to her old friends. One of them, braver than the rest - 'Bear' Ellice, a wealthy merchant and politician - promptly had her letter published in the newspapers:

> March 8 [1825]
> no. 111, Rue du Faubourg St. Honoré,
> a Paris.
>

> Don't trust to bag with your answer.

Having proved himself a most unprofitable subject, Ellice never appeared at all in the *Memoirs*; but the most vulnerable must also never have appeared in print. For the rest there was probably a sort of tariff. If nothing was paid, the more sensitive victims would appear in the most unflattering light; if a modest amount then with a condescending mention. Hence the much-decorated Wellington - who probably did not quite write back 'publish and be damned' - was lampooned as a ratcatcher with a red-ribbon; while the gallant Palmerston was credited as always being good about money. But one man was always mentioned with unctuous praise.

Henry Brougham (1778-1868), as a lawyer, statesman, orator, man of letters and science, was by any reckoning one of the outstanding men of his time. Although the son of a Cumberland man, he happened to be born and brought up in Edinburgh where his maternal grandfather was a famous principal of the University. At that institution he also displayed a remarkable precocity, getting an article published by the Royal Society when he was only seventeen and joining with a small group of brilliant young talents in 1802 to establish the famous Edinburgh Review. His profession became that of advocate; but for him this was never more than the means to another end. Early on he came to London and attached himself to the Whigs and their most popular causes. He led attacks on the slave trade and military flogging; in 1825 he initiated the movement to establish the University of London and in 1827 helped found the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. But he was never an easy colleague and for much of the time he was as much out of parliament as in it. However, he became adviser to the unfortunate Princess of Wales and when Caroline became Queen in 1820 he conducted a brilliant defence against the King's attempt to divorce her. This victory, over both King and Ministry, brought him to the pinnacle of fame in the land and a fortune at the bar. But he still had to wait another ten years before disunion among the Tories and coalition among the Opposition finally carried him to high political office.

Quite when Brougham first became associated with Harriette Wilson remains uncertain; apparently it was in Paris, which he is known to have visited in 1814 and 1817. Their relationship appears at first to have been of a business nature; she was having trouble getting her money from the Duke of Beaufort and Brougham became her adviser in a matter which was fortunately

### Page 20
settled out of court. From her last surviving letter to him it appears that he would have liked to get on even closer terms but that she held him off. Certainly he was no saint; indeed he had the sort of odd-looking ugliness that appealed to many women, and his second visit to Paris was itself the consequence of a strange affair with the wife of Fred Lamb's brother, George. 'Caro George', as Mrs. Caroline Lamb was known in order to distinguish her from her titled sister-in-law, the notorious 'Caro William', was herself the daughter

### Page 22
of the Duke of Devonshire by his second Duchess before the death of the first; the poor girl, though also liked by Byron, yearned for respectability. But George Lamb was a dreadful bore and after years of resistance his wife in 1816 finally ran off to Brougham in Geneva. Brougham, however, seems to have found as tedious as he did Switzerland; '*ennui* comes on the third hour', he wrote, 'and suicide attacks you before night'. Anyhow they soon parted and perhaps it was on the rebound that he dallied with Harriette on the way back. In Julia Johnstone's kindly opinion the only thing that could make her doubt the true nature of the intimacy between them was 'the certainty that a more complete antidote to the tender passion never walked upon two legs (Broom-sticks I mean) than Henry Brougham; His features apparently stamped on a toad-stool, and his eyes like marbles floating in mortar; his chin and nose like the toes of Grimaldi's slipper, when dressed for Whang-fong, and the tout ensemble of his person so much like that of Sir Murray Maxwell's ourang outang, are sufficient to drive love to the devil, only to be out of sight of so horrible a caricature of human nature.' But, she thought Harriette would do anything for money, just as Brougham 'would undertake the filthiest job for the sake of a fee'. It would appear from the later letters of the 'outcast of the English stews' to the 'man of the disgustful countenance', however, that it was not until after Brougham had married a handsome widow that Harriette granted Brougham her favours. But that marriage, which took place on an unpublicized date in 1819 and with a whiff of the shotgun about it, was not a complete success.

With such a combination of qualifications as Brougham had, it is surely not surprising that in the matter of her projected Memoirs Harriette should have looked on him variously as legal adviser, go-between,

### Page 25
and victim. Her first letter to him, however, seems plainly to have been of the first variety:

> July 15 [1824]
> no. 111 Faubourg St. Honoré
> Paris
> 
> Dear Brougham,
> I hope this once you'll assist me. My *Sketches of Character in High Life* which I began a long while ago I cut because Cokeburn [?Colburn] was afraid of making *ill will* by publishing them - a publisher in London [?Stockdale] now offers to take the blame on himself there being *no direct libel*, pay all expences & give me half the profit if I'll finish them. All *admit* them *excellent* well drawn, short & not vulgarly severe only *just* right to make you all *feel them* - not *you* unless you'll let me - at all events there's nothing I can say but good of you and of course for Rochfort's sake I can't talk of you as a lover. However if you say '*No*', I won't mention you - but as to Leinster & Graham I'll make them as much laugh'd at as I can.
> 
> God bless you - if on Tuesdays or Fridays before 5 o'clock you would at any time write to me under cover to his Excellency Sir C. Stuart & send your letter to Foreign Office I should get it cheap safe & pleasant.

Unfortunately for Harriette, Stuart was replaced as ambassador in Paris in the autumn of 1824 and his successor refused to continue her convenient use of the diplomatic bag. Perhaps that was one reason why she thought she had better come over herself before she finally went to print. But while Wellington was evidently unco-operative - though less coolly so than his admirers would have us believe - others promised better:

> 
> My Dear Mr. Brougham,
> I must make myself independent now or never. It won't do to be eternally dunning the few friends I *do possess*. I have been very ill used. This is a desperate effort to live by my *wits* since I cannot make my mind up to make an unfaithful wife. If my book does not procure me an annuity it is my *last* chance save hanging - and after all expences are paid (at least 450£) I only *devide* the rest with my publisher - and old Wellington is writing to us threatening letters about prosecution hanging etc which we laugh at. *Two noble* Lords have preferred *buying themselves* out quietly or rather a *Lord & a Duke*. Now your flaming love letters etc would certainly add to the value & interest of the book, so would anecdotes *three more* who have been kind to me viz - Marquis Graham, Ld. F. Conyngham & Ld. R. Manners. I *begin* by not putting anything in my book about them or you which can possibly *teaze* - if anything [at all] and then I leave it to them to dédommager me with whatever they can spare - towards making me independent once and for all that I may have no excuse for troubling any body again since I live with the most *careful economy* in France. If I only get 100£ a year no friend of mine shall ever be troubled again and of this I *hope* I have every chance - if not more. I leave it to your generosity as to what *you* will contribute. F. Conyngham Graham etc have openly sent me *quite* as much as they could reasonably afford towards purchasing a small annuity. If you cannot afford 50£ perhaps you can 25£. In short I have really suffered so much lately that I throw myself on your good heart, confident that you will contribute your mite towards my perminent relief and you shall have the satisfaction of seeing that I have made a *good use* of your kindness. Rochfort is truly *anxious* that what I may get should be settled intirely on *myself* and out of even his power to touch it or mine beyond the yearly allowance.

The 'three who had been kind' escaped in the very last part of the *Memoirs* with short, ambiguous mentions. Lord Mount Charles, as Francis Conyngham had just become by the death of his brother, 'was perhaps rather cold; but amiable and truly unaffected'; Graham was 'not very popular' but 'not the stupid person many imagine him to be'. Perhaps Brougham sent something too but he was safe enough while Harriette still had better need of his law than his money. For her publisher as well as her husband was now getting into difficulties. Her society victims, including Wellington, apparently had decided, one way or another, to suffer in silence. But some thought an example should be made and they probably set up a respectable stone-mason called Blore, who had been mentioned as courting one of Harriette's sisters at a time when he turned out to have been married, to sue for libel. That case Stockdale insisted on defending himself and lost. But the pirating of such successful Memoirs was a matter in which Harriette had a more material interest, in spite of what she now wrote to Brougham:

> 14 July [1825]
> Paris 111 Rue du Faubourg St. Honoré
> 
> My Dear Sir,
> I am sorry to take up your time, you being against the Memoirs as you told me. With regard to Stockdale's applying to you - I had *no hand* in it as to the *pirates* - neither do I in fact *believe* I shall get any good by him even if he wins as I fear he wishes to take very unfair advantage of me - . . .
> 
> Tommy Moore the poet's *Editor* was at Calais the other day. He tryed *two pirates* as to printing Moore's *Songs*. He lost the first because the copyright was not made over to him by *assignment*. In *vain* did Tom Moore come forward to state that he had sold the work to him. The *law* it seems is that a copyright must be the *author's* till he has properly made an asignment of it to another. (this is the first question I want answered.) Moore having made the assignment, his Editor got every other cause he tried 'because' said Ld. El[l]enborough 'if the work is *immoral* the *pirates* by underselling it add *ten-fold* to the circulation of immorality.'
> 
> My next question is this - I agreed to write 4 vols. of Memoirs (about 12 *quires*) and devide the profits of said 4 vols. with Stockdale. When I left England, only three [out] of 12 quires were written and I signed a *common* agreement on unstamped paper to say 'that the Memoirs she has written or *shall write* (I meaning of course up to the promised 12 quires) Stockdale is to be the joint proprietor of with *Harriette* etc.' Since that I have given him the full 12 quires I proposed and written more which I can sell elsewhere, he having made up no regular accounts or paid me more than 400£ in all for sale of work - and yet he says on the strength of the words in agreement thus *'what she has written or shall write'* (my meaning being only up to what he has now got) Stockdale threatens to lay an injunction on any *future* memoirs I may *publish*. Will you allow your Attorney to write me a candid answer to this question. I dont know who he is and he need not sign any name - I should be very sorry if any body connected with you suffered from ... politeness to me. - but if Stockdale is the *rogue* they say he is, it is hard to be quite at his mercy & no friend to advise at all. All I want is to *dissolve* partnership and have done with him. Am I *liable* for his difficulties as *partner* in what does *not* regard my own work or actions upon it? I mean if I go to London. There had been no book if he had not *enduced* me to use names in full etc etc. Of course I know nothing of law & it serves them all right (as to the Memoirs). Blore did make love to Fanny I can swear - only as usual, I mistook dates & it was when I was a child & she at home.
> . . .
> Yours very Truely
> H.R.
> 
> Will you have the charity to call or send for Portmore [?Pasmore] the attorney you once saw on behalf of Rochfort and ask him what claim he makes out of a debt against Rochfort. Stockdale tells us he has a writ out against him although he made over all his Irish Estates to pay his debts and has contracted none since. Portmore is a great rogue - but that I fear this writ I would request Rochfort to go to town on Stockdale's business. If your attorney can settle that I shall be very grateful or at least tell me what it is.

### Page 31
The reference to Tom Moore is interesting since the name his editor used was Tom Little and the same as that employed to introduce Harriette's *Memoirs*; hitherto there has been no reason to think that Stockdale did anything but borrow it for his productions. Be that as it may, it was Rochfort whose misfortunes troubled her most. The following day she wrote in reinforcement of her postscript's 'hasty scrawl':

### Page 32
> ... they have ... all his estate in their hands which must pay them all & more than all, when sold - but still right or wrong if Rochfort is put in prison again he will be half mad. He has had so much of it; and my *business* suffers much because he is not in London and I have not courage to let him go till Pasmore is settled or till we know what it is; some cheating thing or other I am sure - which if you or your Attorney enquired into he would probably be ashamed of. At all events you can and I hope will just let me know how the matter stands and if your Attorney can in any way ascertain if Rochfort can go to London in safety as to Portmore's *writs*. ... I know he had a writ out and was very near arresting Rochfort the last time he was in town, and that he sent two Bailiffs into the country after him. Rochfort however declares he *owed* him nothing. I know Pasmore is not a respectable man because he wanted to assist Rochfort to marry a rich *widow* & to

### Page 33
> be paid for his trouble some time ago.

To help get themselves out of all their difficulties that year, on 1 September Stockdale also published a first work of fiction by Harriette entitled *Paris Lions and London Tigers*. It was not very good, for it was obviously intended to cash in quickly on the success of the *Memoirs*. But the 'Colonel' made a fleeting appearance as 'young Bellfield' and in the introductory key to some of the other characters there was a charming advertisement about the 'names which appear to be still in want of owners'! Willy nilly in the New Year Brougham also appeared in court to press Stockdale's appeals against the non-suiting of his piracy case. But it was again in vain. Among Rochfort's troubles about this time there was also the disappointment he suffered in another anticipated inheritance. From the bitterness of his 'wife's' next letter to Brougham, his uncle must have been a rich man and the 'Colonel' his hopeful heir at law. But from the details of the divorce case he brought against his wife in 1799, Henry Rochfort was clearly a very unpleasant person indeed and, perhaps because he wished to wreak some vengeance on her, left all his property to an illegitimate son called Cowper Beeby. The will appears to have been proved in September 1821 but, as Harriette herself would say, 'there's nothing like trying':

> 
> My Dear Sir,
> I have to thank you for 5£ received some time ago, also various *other* favors, among them your opinion as to the *Will* of Rochfort's uncle. Still as

### Page 34
> several English lawyers with good *heads differ* from you when you say *there were not sufficient* grounds for setting aside the Will and as it is of so much consiquence to the *real* heir (my husband) that it should be set aside, I hope you will have the *charity* towards me to *reconsider* the subject in this *light*. *Will* the *law*, so *moral* in *general* so *over much* so with regard to my *Memoirs*, continue the *immoral publication* of late Mr. Rochfort's adulterous intercourse with the wife of another man by admitting that Mrs. Beeby's child *was* Mr. Rochfort's son got on her body during her husband's life time from whom she was never devorced? and this admission to the *positive* prejudice and disinheriting of the rightful heir my husband, his very own relation? The person is not *described* in the Will by these words - 'My son illegitimately begot on the body of Mrs. *Beeby*' - that young man being Mrs. Beeby's son by law the real father had no right to publish her adultery. You *moral* men in wigs and gowns have no right I think to countenance the publicity of adultery. Late Mr. Rochfort being *single* his property ought to belong to his heir at law unless by *will* he had *truely* described the person to whom he meant to leave it. This is a novel case, perhaps to puzzle the judges with - but... I would rather take your cool opinion after reflection than any other *man's* - I hope you will not risk to lose us a comfortable income from inattention to the subject. The young man who now enjoys the property is a selfish *miser* who refused to lend his cousin 10£ in a moment of great distress although he puts bye six 100£ yearly out of seven.

In spite of Harriette's tortuous legalism she and her 'husband' were undoubtedly disappointed and in her irritation she began in 1827 to put an unprecedented squeeze on Brougham and, through him, on others even higher in the land. About the time the Memoirs first appeared in 182s there had been strong rumours, evidently only too well founded, that among those who had bought themselves out' were the King and his friend, Lady Conyngham. Harriette must have been paid very well indeed since, as the Prince Regent, George comes off very lightly in the Memoirs, considering his reputation. So does Lady Conyngham, whose affair with John Ponsonby is casually mentioned only as an old and disappointed suit. The second Baron Ponsonby later became well-known as a rather irascible ambassador; when the Sultan of Turkey tried by building a low entrance arch to force foreign representatives to approach him only on their knees, Ponsonby responded by coming in backwards and presenting the Sultan with an appropriate first view. But in the first part of his life he was still more famous for his good looks; it was he who when accidentally caught up in the Terror of the French Revolution was actually cut down from the 'Lanterne' by admiring women. But he fell foul of George IV by captivating Lady Conyngham and then had the indelicacy, we are led to believe, to permit her letters to fall into Harriette's hands. Harriette had once been passionately in love with Ponsonby and her subsequent behaviour was probably dictated as much by jealousy as greed. The King was very jealous too; and he probably paid to hide his shame as much as any guilt. But hardly had he done so than Ponsonby himself returned to England and threatened to revive Lady Conyngham's in-fatuation. Canning, who was Foreign Secretary at the time and às a former supporter of the late Queen Caroline suffered like Brougham from the King's

### Page 36

### Page 37
displeasure, had already partly ingratiated himself by appointing Lady Conyngham's son, Francis, as his under-secretary. Early in 1826 he performed another great service to the Crown by having Ponsonby sent as far away as the legation in Buenos Aires. It was also rumoured that he provided money from the secret service funds to buy the letters in Harriette's possess-ion. But, whoever paid her, Harriette evidently held something back; and to balance the account perhaps, she also had something on another old defender of Queen Caroline and hero of the Opposition, Sir Robert Wilson. In April 1827 Canning became Prime Minister and this must have seemed too good an opportunity to miss. Consequently Rochfort, 'a poor vulgar animal living', as Julia delicately put it, 'on the proceeds of prostitution', made a lightning but risky visit to London in July 1827 in order to arrange a new sale. He also took the opportunity to dun Brougham, but much to Harriette's annoyance was disappointed, even though in the course of a single letter he came down £500, via 'say 250', to the 'small sum of 30£' about which he would not have troubled him at all 'but for circumstances of a most unpleasant nature.' Through Brougham, however, he did succeed in making contact with the King's confidential adviser, Sir William Knighton, who more than a decade earlier had as a doctor attended the deathbed of Harriette's sister Fanny. Then Rochfort rejoined Harriette in the Low Countries. She, however, had already run out of patience and written from there to Brougham recalling past affronts as well as present needs:

> Chimay the 3ist July (1827)

> My Dear Sir,

> Owing to the high opinion these people have formed of Rochfort's industry and principles [their local creditors' hopes of his black-mailing expedition, she no doubt meant]

Most earnestly do I desire not to be obliged to wound the feelings of others particularly I would spare *your feelings* sir, although from what I can gather from my husband's letters you have not been particularly anxious to spare his - having taken up his time in useless attendance on you which has not advanced him *one shilling* - I have so little fear of threats that I have intreated Mr. Canning to make amends to my husband for having refused to grant him his interest as to public employment - at the request of Lord Mountcharles by interceeding with *that family* to do Mr. R. a private service - which shall prevent the strong necessity I am else under to publish that which may be *displeasing to all parties*. *Much* I would do, but I would not want bread or see my husband want bread in order that Lord Mount-charles might give us lieing written promises of protection, Lady C sleep with Lord Ponsonby, Knighton insult my dieing sister and Mr. Brougham *commit adultery* and write arrant amorous nonsense with *impunity* and in *safe secrecy* - *to conceal my vices or follies Mr. Brougham would you see your own wife want bread?* - Now I confess that of two evils I should prefer the lesser - that of having all your private secrets & follies sold for penny ballads and your letters sung about the streets to the tune of *Allez Croker* for a penny - N.B. - original *epistles* shown at a penny a show!! But if you think I shall do this save *in desperation* or without deep regret for that dire necessity which will force me to wound those I admire - you don't know human nature - *truth* carries the stamp of truth along with it. I have still my character for *honest principle*. As yet I have betrayed no one's confidences since I was born. Think you then I shall *willingly* show up these people? Can I desire to show myself a mere inconsistent woman

You can prevent all this and you know that the real well wishers of the C[onyngham]s & Sir R[obert] W[ilson] would interfere to prevent the publication of their having *confessed* their vices adultery etc. to Harriette Wilson. Do we bribe for the concealment of vices *we never committed*? But having done so were it not common sense to prevent the public exposure of such bribes. If it be actionable to *declare* that rather than see my husband want *I will expose all your vices, follies confessions etc*. I am ready to make out my oath to that effect & to present it myself to Sir M. Berney or who you will appoint but earnestly I pray not to be forced to show want of feeling towards you - although when you treated me in all (but *paying me*) with all the cold disrespect due to a *common prostitute* you did not even show towards me the feelings of a gentleman - for though you cut your wife on a Sunday (the better [the] day the better [the] deed) to intrigue with me, whose *poverty* rather than her *will* consented, you not only *offered me nothing* but was only enduced to send me 10£ by a decided *threat* after all kinder means had failed. That you *did* comply with a *threat* sir, much as you affect to dispise one, I have *your letter* to prove clear as daylight since in that you began by stating you have enclosed me a ten pound and proceed to advise me to be more on my guard against writing to others such *threatening* letters as the one you had just received - in my answer, acknowledging the 10 pounds you may remember sir that I told you I had not threatened you *untill* every other milder means had failed to make you behave to me with *common*

Who could lose even a *small* certainty for the risks toils and chances of *publication*. Lord M[ount] Charles promised in his *letters* to interest himself for R - why am *I* alone to keep my word? 1000£ is required to settle us in business - a trifling hope for *hereafter* added to this would be better than leaving that book for publication to lose it. In short most solemnly I pledge myself when the business is once set right to trouble none of the parties again while I live - an annuity of 100£ might perhaps be made out *conditionally* that no one of you be further bored - and 10 years paid down in *advance* - in short you *know* better than I do how to secure the parties from further trouble. I declare to God solemnly I desire to and will act fairly and according to my *oath* if you will directly interest yourself to save us from a prison instead of making R run about for nothing.

Canning's death in August 1827 probably held things up and it was not until the autumn that Knighton made a trip to the Continent to have it out with Harriette. But he came back urging the King to defy her to do her worst. From her next letter she was clearly not getting any better satisfaction from Brougham:

> 16th December [1827] Calais
> In time ruin is the consiquence of your *perfect* indifference towards your *old acquaintance* who, though a writer of men and manners was well

### Page 42

> disposed to *spare your feelings* as well as *Mrs. Brougham*, and to conceal your faults of adultery and other follies untill you made a fool of my husband, wasted his time and refused him the most trifling favors or assistance. I am here to meet the publisher. As my only hope of obtaining any means of existence I must *publish* such truths as will sell - nor is there any one reason why *you* should have your *adultery* & *love letters concealed* for nothing while your friends pay for the concealment of theirs. I once thought you had some regard for me. Time has convinced me I was never more deceived. You have now to decide since I am *quite decided* & shall but wait the return of post from the North supposing you are there and a very few days grace, before the account of your *intregue* in Lisson Grove *since your marriage* with your love letters before, and that which advises me not to threaten in order to frighten me from asking you to pay. *Then* your letter in answer to mine (laughing at *your* threats) and explaining to you that I was *forced* to threaten before I could get the ten pound note your letter *proves* you forwarded after your *intregue* and in *consiquence* of my threat - before the receipt of which not *one sixpence could I get from you*. Now the safe way is that which you proposed to *Lord T[ankerville]*. I am an old friend of yours, all I ask is exactly the *same* terms you proposed to your noble friend viz 40£ a year in the like Bond (one years always paid in advance). Send me directly 40 pound and a line stating that it shall be yearly paid to me by you and your heirs during that part of my life that you are in *no shape annoyed either by my publishing* letters or private communications etc. This Rochfort will sign or agree to, I dare say. I shall wait as I have said exactly the due time for your answer - if it does not arrive at no 14 Rue du Colysée *a Paris Faubourg St. Honoré* I shall apply

### Page 43

> to *Mrs.* Brougham directly sending her a copy of this letter. Should that lady *not object to the publication* of her husband's adultery - B--lting etc, [then why] should I? Luckily I always keep the same servants about me and can easily make clear the exact truths I shall advance dates & all - not that I accuse you of wishing to deny the positive *fact* of your having been false to your wife. I have your letter dated sending me the 10 pounds in consiquence, and *copies* of all my letters to you. No man can have been more unfeeling that you were to Rochfort, why should I *favor* you? but if you pay me for the loss of interest my book will sustain I shall be *glad* to spare your feelings. Nay, if you say to me on your honor 40£ a year is *more than you can* spare your old acquaintance, I will accept *30 pounds a year*, if tendered directly and gratefully.
>
> You will *find this* to be my last communication and I hope you will decide agreeably to us *both*.

> If *you* will make no sacrifice to spare Mrs Brougham's feelings *why should I*? You certainly must be expected to sacrifice more for the mother of your children the wife you have chosen than *I* who never saw her. If her peace of mind is not considered by you *her husband* worth 30 pound a year I naturally conclude she is good for nothing. Since you pass for a good honorable man I have in my book drawn this fair conclusion - that, as you came to intregue with me on a Sunday morning *after* your love for me was gone it must have been your usual way of passing the *Sabath* in all probability. If I have time to copy it Mrs. B shall have your part in MS. to judge for herself whether it ought to fall into your *children's hands*.

This letter at least sent a useful Christmas gift of £20 across the Channel but with her hopes of Royal Bounty still in doubt that was clearly not enough:

> Dieppe 9th January [1828]
>
> Sir,
> I am greatly obliged to you for your assistance of 20£. I am quite determined to act up to my *promise*, on condition that you grant me 40 pounds a year - but for one twenty pound note or even two you may conceive that as a speculation it can never be worth my while to surpress *anecdotes* of a man so celebrated. Your letter without a signature can be good for nothing, and were you to die tomorrow, your heirs would laugh at my claiming 40 pounds a year from an unsigned note. If now you will immediately sign a few lines to this effect you *shall* I *declare to you* never have the slightest cause to repent of it - if not I am free to publish what I please.... I am anxious for your answer because I expect the publishers to meet me here to agree for the purchase of my MSS.
> This, or something to this effect is all I require to be thankful and grateful to you
>
> > I agree and engage myself to pay or cause to be paid to your order the sum of forty pounds annually in two half yearly payments of twenty pounds on each and every first of January and 1st of July in every year during your lifetime so long as you cause me no sort of serious annoyance either by using my name or causing it to be used in any publication - or in any other way after this day the — 1828 and in the event of your survivance I will make it a request that my heirs or executors keep up the payments regularly.

While Harriette awaited a further concession from Brougham, the ailing King succumbed to his fears and in March sent a reluctant Knighton once more across the Channel to haggle with her. What the result was we do not know; but probably it was inconclusive since in June they were both once more in Paris and Harriette was endeavouring to tide herself over by extracting on the nail the first half year's payment on the annuities to which she had in the meantime obviously got Brougham as well as poor Lord Tankerville to agree:

> (30 June 1828)
> Hotel des Languedoines
> No 12 Rue St Roch
> Poissonière
> Paris
> 
> My dear Sir,
> As you will keep your word I feel convinced *and allow me* to receive the 20 pound on the day it is due by your own agreement pray send it here to Paris which will be more convenient to you than Dieppe.
> ... I live in Dieppe but am here for eight or ten days on business. Do me the charity to send me the 20£ on the day you receive this or the next day as I am so miserably distressed, the least delay in my present very unfortunate circumstances will be severely felt, without being of the *slightest service* to you.
>
> Yours dear Sir
> Very Truely and obliged
> H. Rochfort
> 
> Lord Tankerville has had my receipt some time. It is due on the same day if you happen to see him perhaps you would tell him you have heard from me that I am much distressed and offer to forward me his 20£. ... Pray use no delay as I am in a strange Inn without a frank.

Evidently they did not delay. Brougham, increasingly, could hardly afford to take such a risk. Over-eager as he always was to take advantage of the tortuous shifts and sudden changes of fortune in the politics of 1827-8, he had resorted to such tactics in and out of parliament as to bring both his principles and his wisdom into ever more serious doubt on the part of his colleagues and to endanger his pretensions to lead the Whigs in the House of Commons. In the latter

### Page 48

part of 1827 some senior Whigs had joined the King to deny him high office and after the collapse of Goderich's feeble coalition ministry early in the New Year, no one could be quite sure whether Brougham was plotting to rebuild his political fortunes on the ruins of the new Wellington administration or among its ranks. Behind his back the charming Harriette called him 'the Diddler' and even as he tried to sweeten her she contrived new demands with which to plague him:

> Tibermont Dieppe [1 Aug. 1828]
> My dear Sir,
> I received the 20£ quite safe and thank you sincerely - but I dont bother you with postage merely to *thank you* - or is it to ask you any further favor - but in the name of common sense and common policy I ask you to turn over in your mind the talents of Rochfort and consider whether you can employ him in any way that may turn out useful to *yourself or friends*. *Clerks* are easily procured at so many *pence* per day but extraordinary quickness of invention & resources in all manner of difficulty are rare and useful qualities. So active a mind - as fertile in invention & resources I never met with as Rochfort's - something he must and will do - he will join the Catholics or the D—l rather than milch his cow and lead a rural life. His name is popular in Ireland. I only ask you to turn in your mind how Rochfort's extraordinary energy and abilities can be brought into play so as to be of use to yourself or your friends as well as to us all. One head even Brougham's head cannot be equal to all that you want with it. Rochfort's sense and feeling of honor to the gang' is as high flown & romantic as can possibly be imagined - by this odd expression I mean that his simple word given to those who confide is

### Page 49

> more sacred than that of any person I ever met with. He possess's the style of quickness & cleverness which would exactly suit your taste and impatience. ... Rochfort will be in London in a few weeks. Pray take the matter into *consideration*. This is all I ask.
>
> Yours Truely and Obliged
> Harriette Rochfort

Although Rochfort himself, with the supreme self-confidence and unconscious irony of the polished blackmailer, often headed his letters with the family crest and motto - 'Truth gives wings to strength' -

![Image of Rochfort's crest]()

Brougham would no doubt have rather agreed with Harriette about his 'extraordinary quickness of invention'. For according to Julia it was he who composed Harriette's letters. Brougham did not employ him; but he must have wondered whether such audacity was wise when at the end of the year Harriette arrived in person to compensate for an unexpected disappointment in another quarter by pressing him for her half-yearly payment, not merely on the nail but actually in advance:

### Page 50

18th December 1828
18 Lower Crown
Brompton

Received of Henry Brougham Esq. the sum of twenty pounds being the amount of half a year’s annuity due to me on the 1st of January next.

Harriette Rochfort

### Page 51

> [13 Dec. 1828]
> 16 Trevor Square
> Knightsbridge
> 
> My dear Sir,
> I arrived in England a few weeks ago. The sudden unexpected death of Mr. F[ermor] who paid me during his life 100f a year has much distressed me.
> I shall therefore feel obliged and grateful if you will forward me the zof due on the first of next month directly for which I enclose you a receipt and beg to offer my best wishes for your health and success.
> 
> Yours very truely and sincerely
> Harriette Rochfort

Brougham retained the receipt; perhaps he thought he might as well pay up a mere three weeks in advance.
But he had set a bad precedent and to ram the moral home in her next letter Harriette indicated that her mind was turning once again to thoughts of pub-lication:

> Sunday 1 February [1829]
> 16 Trevor Square, Knightsbridge
> My dear Sir,
> ... I am reduced to such pressing difficulty that I am obliged to throw myself on your kindness for a little advance of the annuity you grant me. No want of economy has been the cause. I have endeavoured to avoid giving my friends trouble but having bought a few necessary articles of furniture while Mr. Fermor was in perfect health I shall be forced to pay for them or be put immediately to endless expences of *law writs* etc. Having half finished a novel in the style of Gil Blas from which I have reason to expect profit, I may therefore perhaps

### Page 52

> better spare your allowance when due than now. ... Should you refuse, my small debts will soon be increased beyond my power to discharge - and since the accident of Mr. Fermor's death was so *unexpected* and happened just a few days before 100£ would have been due to me I must trust and hope that my old acquaintance will make the advance that necessity the most pressing *alone* should have compelled me to trouble him about after receiving two Lawyers' letters full of threats of *writs etc*. You, as a Lawyer can *pity* any poor devil of a woman whose small debts are about to be swelled by summons - every day making bad worse untill there is no end to her difficulties and no hopes left of getting clear of them.
> 
> Yours my Dear Sir
> with sincerest wishes for your happiness
> Harriette Rochfort

Harriette's talk of writs turned out to be justified; but they came from a quarter that evidently amazed her. She had brought over with her from Paris as a lady's maid a girl of 18 called Julia La Toille. According to Harriette she had saved the girl from disgrace in Paris only to find her trifling with her own brother in London and in an altercation had knocked her from her chair. A few days later she was summoned for assault and held up to public ridicule in court and press alike. Harriette, hoist perhaps with her own petard, was bitterly annoyed. She certainly suspected it was a plot to shut her up where other legal means would be too embarrassing. It was natural enough, therefore, that she should talk again of *publication* and threaten to revive the scandals of the Conynghams and others who thought they had safely bought themselves out:

### Page 53

> [Feb. 1829]
> 16 Trevor Square
> My Dear Sir,
> In consiquence of the Warrant served on me by two police officers I have been subject to every possible annoyance from old Duns, insulting letters and the most abusive language in the papers - unless I am outlaw'd because some six years ago I, in a book set forth our nobles *en robe de chambre et en bonet de nuit*. Perhaps, as my Counsel you will not object to state in writing your candid opinion of the justice of my late arrest. Do you believe sir that, if I were to apply to the same magistrate for a warrant of assault which I state to have occurred seven days ago, notwithstanding which I had remained ever since an inmate of the ladies house who assaulted me without having complained even to the female in the house - but enjoying the ladies hospitality freely for seven days before the pet took me to apply for a warrant - do you believe that I should have got it without witnesses or wounds to prove my state-ment? It would be a hard case if insult is to be ever heaped on me, because the Cony[ng]hams dread the publication of a Commedy for which I have refused 1000f desiring to lead a harmless quiet life.
I was at the time particularly persuaded and encouraged to write the Mémoirs by Lord Mount-charles. I copy you a few lines from letters of his Lordship's now before me signed with his name and dated -
I hope that the s[th] part will soon appear. You are quite mistaken about the Mémoirs. My bookseller knowing my eagerness for them sends them to me almost before I hear they are published....
Our friend Duke of Richmond is such a queer tempered fellow that to say the truth I do not like writing to him on the subject, but I will speak to
