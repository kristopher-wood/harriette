CHAP. XV. 


A LONG LETTER FROM THE PAGE EUGENIO, DATED 
LONDON, CONTAINING SKETCHES OF ENGLISH CHA- 
RACTER IN HIGH LIFE. 

The C'ardinal had a good night, and sanguine 
hopes being entertained of his speedy recovery 
his sister became calm. The poHce, such as exists 
at Naples, was on the " qui vive" to discover the 
deliquents, and it was soon ascertained, beyond a 
doubt, that a boat having conveyed two gentle- 
men to a vessel waiting in the bay ready to sail,

they had got out of the reach of detection, and the 
wind being favorable, had contrived to leave the 
kingdom in safety. The snuff box, which I have 
already mentioned, was supposed to have been 
dropped by one of the party, on the floor of the 
dining saloon ; on being examined, was found to 
contain a beautiful portrait of Laura, the Lady 
Poco-puranti's late protegee. Whether this por- 
trait had been the property of the green dominos, 
or of the Cardinal himself, was a puzzle to me. 
The Cardinal denied being the owner of it. 

It soon began to be whispered about that the 
disguised brother, and lo^er of Laura had taken 
this method of being revenged on her seducer. 
The Cardinal was rich, and gay, and popular, and 
above all powerful in 'Naples, so no one felt in- 
clined to interfere to his prejudice, or to pry too 
closely in to the mystery that enveloped this affair, 
since his Eminence Poco-puranti shewed such an 
earnest desire that the story should be for ever 
buried in oblivion. 

N ot choosing to leave the lady Poco-puranti im- 


CLARA GAZUL. 3 

mediately after this alarming adventure, I wrote 
to the Countess of Polignac to put off my visit to 
her for two months, at the end of which period, 
the Cardinal being perfectly recovered, I took my 
leave of his kind sister, and was welcomed by the 
Lady Polignac, with the warmest demonstrations 
of joy. 

On enquiring eagerly about Ligonia and her son, 
I was informed that the last accounts she had re- 
ceived from Russia were from Eugenio*s Tutor, 
who wrote to say that his pupil's health suffered 
so considerably from the coldness of the climate, 
that after shewing him what was most worthy to 
be seen, he had advised him to leave Russia and 
travel towards Germany; that after visiting various 
parts of the Continent, he should, at the earnest 
request of Eugenio, take a trip with him to Eng- 
land, the Lady Polignac having been pleased to 
intrust to his discretion, the travels of her child, 
who would soon write very fully from the capital 
of England. 

I remember nothing which occurred to me 


4 CLARA OAZUL. 

worth relating during the first two months that 
I remained with the Countess, who saw but httle 
society. I occasionally heard from the Countess 
Drognichief, and often from my nurse; the for- 
mer pressed me to join her at Paris, where she 
had resided some time, but much as I had reason 
to like Rosa, I dreaded the effects of her jealous 
disposition. 

My nurse, with her husband Albert, had left 
the service of the Count, by whose assistance they 
had taken a small shop at Dieppe, a fishing town 
in Normandy, where several of Agnes*s relations 
resided. 

One morning when I had been an inmate of the 
Lady Polignac more than four months, she hand- 
ed me the following letter from her son, dated 
London, Clarendon Hotel, Bond street : 

" My Dearest Mother, 
" I have been three weeks in this city, and I 
" delayed writing that I might give you some lit- 
" tie account of our mode of living here. We 


CLARA GAZUL. O 

" left Paris towards the end of April, and pro- 
" ceeded post to Calais, without a single letter of 
" introduction, although our bankers Messrs de 
'* Rothschild at Paris, would fain have given us 
*' several; but I hate patronage, so docs my Tutor 
•* Monsieur de Ville. Both of us understand the 
" English language, and being provided with 
** money, as well as intelligence, why should we 
*' not make our way. 

" We landed at Dover, after a very short 
" passage, and arrived at the Clarendon hotel at 
" about five in the afternoon, and having dined 
" excellently well, we proceeded, at my earnest 
" request, to Covent Garden theatre. The house 
" was crowded, we were obliged to sit in the 
" upper boxes. The salle de spectacle is both 
" splendid and neat, though much inferior in all 
" respects to San Carlos*. 

" Having obtained front seats, we were most 
** anxious to attend to the stage, but were pre- 
*' vented by two highly rouged females, who

CLABA GAZUL. 

" were continually coming into the box and going 
" out of it. A t last one of them took it into her 
" head to torment poor Monsieur de Ville, by 
" leaning on liis shoulder, or affecting to stumble 
" against him and then ask pardon. Annoyed 
" by these women, who appeared to be of the very 
" lowest class, we quitted the box, and wan- 
" dered about the galleries right and left in order 
" to examine the building. 

" We were soon followed by our female tor- 
" mentors, who becoming more explicit on the out 
" side of the boxes, proposed to us to accompany 
" them home. I laughed at them at first till they 
** grew disgustingly indecent, and then I told them 
" in an angry voice (seeing the annoyance they 
" contrived to give my poor Tutor) to go to the, 
"devil. They "now began to hiss and abuse me, 
" and to crown all, called me " Boney " and ** Bo- 
" naparte." I opened my eyes at the sound of my 
•' father's name,' but soon guessed that Boney must 
** probably be a sort of bye word among the vul- 
" gar, to express the ne plus ultra of an enem} to 
" John Bull. 


CLARA QAZUL. 7 

** One of our fair companions, a tail strapping 
" handsome wench, possessing twice the strength 
" of my Tutor, took hold of his neckhandkerchief 
" and untied it with vociferous bursts of laughter, 
" exclaiming, * Well Mouseer, shew us your false 
" collar — Let us see if you wear a shirt' I then 
" lost my temper for my Tutor's sake, which you 
" know is not by nature placid, and seizing the 
" woman by the hand, dragged her away iVom my 
" poor persecuted friend. 

" * Help! Help ! you — coward ! — you 'but I 

" will not shock you, my dear mother, by attempt- 
" ing to translate all the vile epithets she used ; 
" but coward was the expression that seemed 
" most to please her. 

" Why will you insult people? why force me 
" to forget you are a woman ? I asked. 

" They grew more noisy — one of the boxkeepers 
** interfered, and commanded silence. A spruce 
" youth in a green coat, who had observed us for 
" some time, now came forwards and told the box- 
" keeper, that he had seen the Frenchman use 


Q CLARA GAZUL. 

*' force towards the elder female, and that he 
" ought to be taken into custody for a cowardly 
" chap in striking poor harmless women. 

" The word '* coward," had just escaped the 
" Englishman's lips when his cheek was saluted 
" with as hearty and well aimed a box on his ears 
" as my arm could bestow. In another instant, 
" the said blow would have been returned with 
*' interest, but that in less than a second afterwards, 
" he held me in the safe custody of two English 
" constables, pour mon debut a Londres. 

" De Ville's anxiety about me, was cruel — * It 
" will be nothing, my dear Sir, go home quietly, 
" and consult our landlord, it will soon be set to 
" rights.' was all I had time to say, before I was 
" dragged out of the house, and committed to the 
" watch house. The guards of the night, after 
" ascertaining that I could pay them well pro- 
" cured me a clean blanket and some porter, 
'* whence, in spite of my anxiety about my poor 
" Tutor, I soon fell asleep, for my journey had fa- 
" tigued me. At ten, the next morning, I was led 


CLARA GAZUL. 9 

" into the presence of ****** vv ho is, the 
" fashionable magistrate it seems here. The 
** constable who had committed me in charge 
" to the watchman stated, * that his interference 
" had been called for by one of the box keepers 
" of Covent Garden, that two females having com- 
" plained of ill usage from the young French- 
" man, who, as they asserted, had struck at them, 
** Mr, Roe had taken their part, and called the 
" Frenchman a coward for having struck at a 
* woman, — that the foreigner had, without fur- 
" ther ceremony, given Mr. Roe a box on the ear, 
" so as to make them, as he should think, tingle 
** again, which had so exasperated Mr. Roe, that 
" he would soon have finished Moonsheer, but for 
" his interference.' 

" * And pray young gentleman,' said the magis- 
*' trate, addraessing me, * what have you to say for 
** yourself?' 

" That my name is Eugenio, that the man who 

" represents himself as Mr. Roe, called me a cow- 

" ard,and that I resented it immediately by giving

" him a box on the ears, as I should do again un- 
** der the like circumstances. 

" * You have committed an assault Sir, and I 
" am sorry to see one so young, and a foreigner 
*• too, in the custody of watchmen — What is your 
" profession or business in London, Sir.* 

" I am on my travels with my Tutor, whom I 
" see in the room. We arrived at the Clarendon 
" Hotel last night from Dover. 

" * Hem I — You were in a vast hurry to dis- 
" tinguish youself methinks- How came you to 
" quarrel v^ith these women?' 

" They annoyed and insulted my Tutor, and I 
" pushed them on one side. Mr Roe was then 
** desired to stand up. 

" * What is your profession. Sir,* 

" * I am a fishmonger.' 

" * Where do you live V 

" * In Co vent Garden, every body knows me, 
" I am a quiet peaceable young man, unless I see 
" the ladies ill used, and then I can't contain my- 
self. These liere Frenchmen, you see, are in 


CLAilA CiAZL'L 11 

*' the habit of treating ladies with very great 
" contempt, I assure you, for I have been in 
•* Paris, and at the Palais Royal, and can tell you 
" something about their goings on; but it won't 
** do in England. English ladies don't like to be 
" shoved, Hor pushed neither, in this here land of 
" freedom.* 

** * You are particularly eloquent, Mr. Roe,' 
" said the Magistrate, * but if you had kept your 
" own counsel, you would have escaped a box on 
" the ear, and the ladies would have been no worse 
" than they are now. Do you mean to prosecute, 
" Sir ?' 

'* * Why undoubtedly, I must have some kind 
** of satisfaction for that wipe of the face, since 
" those meddling box keepers interfered before 
" I could give the lad a due and proper hiding 
" for his imperence.' 

" * Then Sir, you must put in bail for the as- 
** sault,' said the magistaate, addressing me. 

" I replied, that I was a perfect stranger in 


12 CLARA GAZUL. 

** England, where I had not a single acquaiiil- 
*' ance. 

.« » Very strange, but you have a banker, 1 pre- 
*' sume.* 

" My Tutor came forward to say that we 
** brought letters of credit on the house of De 
" Rothschild, but that disliking obligations, he 
" believed his pupil would decline making an ap- 
*« plication of the sort. 

** • Then the young man must go to prison,' 
" said the magistrate, adding, * that as he was a fo- 
" reigner, he wished the matter could be made up.* 

** A gentleman who had accompanied ^^y T"- 
" tor from the Clarendon, now came forwards, 
** ard touching his hat, with much politeness, ad- 
•* dressed me as follows : — * I live in the same 
'* hotel with you, and have taken the liberty of 
** accompanying your friend, at the representation 
'* of our landlord, Mr. Jacquier. Will you permit 
" me to offer bail for you. This is my name/ 
*' added the young gentleman, taking a card from 
*' a very elegant little case, and presenting it to me. 


CLARA GAZUL. 13 

* I read *' the L'arl ot Ricketty," and presenting 
" my own, upon which was written " Monsieur 
** Eugenio," I endeavoured to express my sense 
'* of his great politeness. 

" * Will you permit me then the pleasure of 
*• offering my bail at once?' enquired his Lord- 
'* ship, good naturedly. 

" With thanks, my Lord, and I will take care 
" that you do not have to repent your confidence 


" in a stranger. 


" Lord [licketty soon arranged the business 
•* with the fashionable magistrate, who informed 
" me I was at liberty to depart. 

" * Will you accept my arm.^' said his Lord- 
'* ship when we got into the street 

*• W^ith pleasure, in half a second, said I, for I 
** had at that moment an opportunity of addres- 
" sing Mr. Roe. Drawing him a little on one side, 
" I whispered to him that I was always to be heard 
" of at the Clarendon, or at my banker's Mr. 
*' Rothschild, and would be ready to give him 
** any satisfaction he might require. 


14 CLARA GAZUL. 

***Oh! we trades people don't tight with 
" swords,^nor pistols neither,* answered the man, 
'* * but you can t wonder at my not liking to 
" have my ears boxed by a child, that I could 
" throw over the lamp post with my finger and 
" thumb, as the saying is.' 

'** What saying?' Lord Ricketty asked, having 
** just joined us; then turning laughingly towards 
** me, he added, in good freneh, ' Pray let me settle 
*' this nonsensical business for you Mr. Eugenio/ 
'* You don't appear to understand dealing with 
*' John Bull — * II faut baisser pavillion.*' 

" I have no alternative. 

" • Mr. Roe,' said Lord Ricketty, turning to- 
** wards the fishman, * permit me to speak to you as 
*• a friend ;' the fishmonger here took of his hat, 
** for the condescentions of Lords to tradesmen in 
" this land of liberty ever makes a deep impres- 
'* sion. * It is a very disagreable thing to be cal- 
" led a coward as you will admit.' 

* You niusl strike your flag.— Ed. 


CLA.RA GAZUL. 15 

<f * Why, to be sure,' said Roe, scratching his 
" head. 

" * And an Englishman's first impulse, on these 
** occasions, generally prompts him to prove the 
" defamer a liar,' continued his Lordship. 

" * Certainly, my Lord, that is no more than the 
** truth,' said Roe. 

" * Well then Mr. Roe," his Lordship proceed- 
«* ed, • the best and surest proof this young gentle- 
*• man could give you, that you had belied him, 
" was by venturing to serve you as you would 
" have served him, under the like provocation.— 
" Now if you will say that you are sorry you pro- 
*• voked him, I think he will as willingly express 
" to you his regrets for the whole of what has pas- 

" sed.* 

" * With all my heart,' said the fishmonger, 
*• ' give us your hand young gentleman, 1 dont be- 
•« lieve you hurt the ladies, so I am sorry I Aagra- 
" toated you, and to make amends, I tell you that 
«* I have heard say that you French men can fight 
** like * limbs/ when you're warmed to it.' 


16 CLAKA GAZUL. 

" And is that all that is to be said in our fa- 
" vor ? I asked laughing, and then added, Mr, 
** Roe, I beg to assure you that I am very sorry 
*' for the whole affair, and particulary, I regret 
•* that the conduct of the females should have ob- 
" liged me to push them aside. Saying this, I 
*• offered Mr. Roe my hand, who gave it a cordial 
•* shake, and we then took our leave of the fish- 
" monger. 

** Bending our steps now towards the Clarendon 
«• Hotel, Lord Ricketty paid me many compli- 
" ments on my excellent accent in speaking En- 
" glish. His Lordship mentioned that he expect- 
** ed some half dozen friends to breakfast with 
" him, and invited us to join them. My Tutor ex- 
" cused himself on the plea of fatigue and indispo- 
" sition, but he seemed to wish me to avail my- 
" self of this opportunity of getting into a little 
** English society, and as I liked the countenance 
"of my new acquaintance, I accepted his invi- 
" tation. 

*' Lord Ricketty appeared to be about two or 


CLARA GAZUL. 17 

" three and twenty ; a thin tall stripling with a 
«* lively countenance, and fine eyes, irregular fea- 
*' tures, straight fair hair, and a pale face. His 
" expressions struck me as well chosen, and his 
" remarks shrewd and lively. 

** We found only two gentlemen in his sitting 
" room on our arrival at the Clarendon, one of 
** whom he introduced to me by the name of 
** Lord Dolittle, a stout man of about forty years 
" of age, with rosy cheeks, — the other was a very 
*' handsome man, whose countenance struck me 
" as one I had before seen. This was no other 
" person than the Mr Delford, who, with his fa- 
" ther, passed some months at Naples last year. 
" Miss Clara, saw a great deal of this gentlaman 
*' when he visited the Countess Drognichieff. It 
'* was an odd fatality my meeting with him on 
" the second day of my arrival in London. He 
" recollected me the moment he heard my name, 
*' and having shook me by the hand, asked me a 
*' thousand questions about Miss Clara Gazul. — 
" We were shortly afterwards joined by tlie Mar^ 
Vol n. D 


18 CLARA GAZUL. 

" quis of Boobeedon, and Mr. Kingdomcome, 
** whose father is a distinguished personage of very 
*• high rank. 

•• Lord Ricketty did the honors with grace and 
*' easy politeness. — Ths conversation ran on eve- 
** ning parties, women of the town, horses and 
" curricles. None of these subjects amused me, 
" so I sat still and eat my breakfast. I dare say 
*• they thought me a very heavy stupid young 
" man, which I could not help, as I really don t 
" know how to aflect to feel an interest about 
" subjects that bore and tire me. 

" Lord Dolittle good naturedly tried to draw 
*• me out. * Do you promise yourself much plea- 
" sure from your visit to London? he asked. 

" * A great deal my Lord,* said I, there is, in 
" fact, nothing I more ardently desire than to 
** make myself acquainted with, than the com- 
" merce, laws, and politics of England ; that is to 
" say, in as great a degree as time and my capa- 
" city will permit. 

'* Lord Pickle, who had just shewn his hand- 


CLARA GAZUL. 19 

" some face at the door of the apartment, and 
" was taking off his gloves, said, * You're all too 
** scientific for me, what are you prosing about,?' 
"then observing that I was a stranger; * I beg 
" pardon, I thought I was to meet with no one 
** but our old set* Lord Ricketty presented me 
" to Lord Pickle, who addressed me in excellent 
" French, aked me when I left Paris, and if I knew 
" any of the actresses, named a great many to me, 
" and declared he hated them all. 

** ' Why the deuce do you visit them then/ 
" said Lord Dolittle, his mouth full of roast par- 
" tridge. 

*' * Visit ! Hem ! Why what is a man to do in 
** such a blackguard place as Paris ? I go to half 
** a dozen of these nasty things, sometimes of a 
** morning, for the vice and viciousness of it. I 
" am naturally vicious : there was a man wanted 
" me to call a young fellow out for having said at 
" a large party that I was an unparalleled liber- 
" tine; but just the contrary, I asked him to dine 
• with me.' 


20 CLARA UAZUL. 

" * I will tell you what, Pickle,' said Colonel 

** Kingdomcome, a fat, fair, jolly handsome 

" man, who seemed to be bursting out of his tight 

" coat, * you are below par, Pickle, you must re- 

" form.' 

*' * You be d — d,' said Lord Pickle, whose 
" graceful person, had struck me with admira- 
" tion, until he opened his mouth. 

** * I wonder I never met you in Paris,' said his 
" lordship, who seemed to have taken a liking to 
** me. * Did you ride about jnuch ? — Is it long 
** since you was there ?' 

" I am a Neapolitan, I replied, although I 
•' studied at the university of Paris. 

•* • I wish you would not talk about your stu- 
•• dies, ce nest pas requ in this country ; what has 
** a handsome fellow like you to do with study, 

" and d- bother of that sort ? Fencing is the 

" only thing to study. You fancy we English- 
*' men know nothing about fencing, but I have 
" done something in that way to distinguish my- 
** self in Paris. 1 wont ask you if you can fence 


CLAUA GAZUL. -21 

'* I am Rure you can. You liave a fencing face, — 
" What a nice light rider you must be ! How 
" much do you weigh ? Which do you like best, 
" the French seat on horseback or the English ? 
" I don't despise a French seat, I assure you. — It 
** is different from ours, but it has its merit. — Do 
" you know the Mount Diables ? Good rou^s 
" and they ride hard ! Eh ? — but you are an 
" Italian, I had forgotten. — I was a long time in 
" Italy, and made a fool of myself there, about an 
" old woman ! don't you hate old women, eh ! 
"youngster? — Why don't you speak? Tell 
** me, eh, youngster, why don't you speak ? Tell 
" me what you like best? What, are you dumb ? 
" I am sorry to^ see you sulky, little fellow, be- 
•* cause I had taken a liking to you.' 

*' Me sulky ! my Lord, not I, it is the first ac- 
" cusation of the kind lever met with. It struck 
" me that your lordship was in want of a good 
*' listener, and therefore I tendered to you my 
" ear, in hopes of making myself agreeable. 

** Lord Ricketty laughed, and gave me a look 


e-2 CLARA GAZUL. 

*• of encouragement ; 'you are a pretty fellow to 
** quiz one in this sort of way." said Pickle. 
Ja «• t "vvhy you did not give Mr. Eugenio time to 
*• get a word in for the last quarter of an hour/ 
** said Lord Dolittle, adding, * Do you get grouse 
♦* in Italy, Sir ? What do you think of ours ? It 
•* is better than this in the north of England. ' 
" I told his lordship that I thought the English 
" kitchen delicious, particularly after having fast- 
" ed so long. This remark occasioned Lord 
" Rickety to relate my adventure of the morn- 
" ing. Lord Pickle laughed heartily at my hav- 
'* ing proposed to have an affair of honor with a 
*• fishmonger. The Marquis of Boobeedon here 
*• opened his lips for the first time, and with a 
*' condescending air of protection, said, graciously 
** smiling, * It was a capital mistake you made, 
*' Mr. Eugenio* * 

" True my Lord, for I knew not till to day that 
" English tradesmen were ignorant of the use of 
" arms. 

" * And suppose this were not the case, who 
** would measure his good sword with a fish- 


CLARA GAZUL. -23 

** monger,' enquired Colonel Kingdomcome af- 
" fee ted ly. 

" I would have done so this morning, I replied, 
** adding, that I had no right to boast of ancient 
" descent myself, being a mere *' enfant trouve,*' 
" who when an infant, had been found tied in a 
** basket at the door of a great Cardinal residing 
*' in Naples. 

" * A frank confession,'observed Lord Dolittle, 
•* opening his eyes, as if he did not know what to 
** make of me. 

** * Why, it may be all a hum, for any thing 
** you know, master wise acre,' said Pickle, then 
*' turning to me and observing that I reddened, he 
" added, I am only in joke, you dont suppose 
'* I w^ouldwish to ofl'endyou r' 

'* I take it for granted that you are too well 
" bred, my Lord ; but I must seize this oppor- 
" tunity of informing my noble entertainer, that 
*' I am in truth ' un enfant trouve,' with this 
*' advantage over the greater part of my fraternity, 
'* that all my pecuniary wants have been liberally

** provided for by my parents or friends, whoever 
" they may be. 

" ' Money makes the mare to go/ said Lord 
" Ricketty with a bow, and a good natured 
*' smile. Mr. Delford here came forward to speak 
" of me and my progress in literature, in the most 
" flattering terms, and was pleased to say of me 
** that I was considered a prodigy at school. 
•* He also related what he had learned in Naples ; 
*' namely, that Bonaparte, when he visited the 
" college, had bestowed on me his portrait as a 
*• mark of his approbation. 

*'Oh! Ho! was Lord Dolittle's exclamation. 

" Ha! Ha! was Kingdomcome's ejaculation. 

" Pooh! pooh! wasLordBoobeedon's indefinite 
" remark, uttered with a sneering expression of 
" the mouth which looked as if he would have 
** been ironical if he had known how. 

** Lord Pickle whistled, which was as much as 
" to say ' fiddlededee,' or * bah!' while my enter- 
" tainer, with friendly warmth, proposed his ser- 
*' vices in any shape which might be agreeable to 

me. 


CLAKA CA'IUL, 46 

" * He would,* he said, *take me into the gallery, 
" of the House of Commons to hear the debates, 
" introduce me to Lord Munby, who had written 
** several light works, and was rather clever, and 
" he would take me with him to the Opera, tha» 
*• very evening, where I should see all the world. 

" * We shall have no chance with the women 
" when Mr. Eugenio shows his face, drawled out 
'* the Marquis of Boobeedon. 

" * None on earth, we must hide our diminished 
" heads, 'pon honor,' said Colonel Kingdomcome, 
** glancing towards the looking glass. 

'• * He thinks himself the handsomest man in 
" London,' said Lord Dolittle, who was rich, mar- 
" lied, and privileged. 

" Breakfast being at length concluded, we all 

" took a walk through the fashionable streets* 

" When we got to Charing Cross, I observed the 

*' statue of a man on horse-back. It struck me as a 

•* decent performance, but it was placed so high, 

" that it was impossible to examine it accurately.

" kind enough to amuse me with the following 
" anecdote out of which my Tutor might find mat- 
" ter for a moral of discourse on the uncertainty 
** and vanity of all sublunary things. 

" It is the statue of Charles the First who was 
** beheaded at that very window/ said Lord Rick- 
" etty, and proceedeed thus, ' The statue was con- 
'* sidered at the time not only as a most extraordi- 
*' nary likeness of his Majesty, but a model of 
** sculpture, and the artist had reason to promise

SHEWING WHAT BEFEL LAURA. 

I WAS summoned into the dining saloon, a short 
time after the above letter had been received. " Is 
your name Gazul ?" enquired an elderly female, 
whose face was concealed in a hood. 

Upon my answering in the affirmative, she re- 
quested me to accompany her to the celebrated 
Convent of St. Lorenza, w hich was situated a few 
miles from Naples, acquainting me that I should 
there meet with an old friend, who had just en- 
tered her noviciate, and was in deep affliction. I 
enquired her name, but was informed that parti- 
cular reasons rendered discretion necessary, and 


fLAKA (rAZUI.. '29 

that I must, therefore, endure suspense, until I 
arrived at the Convent. 

The Countess of Polignac having permitted one 
other maleservants to accompany me, I presented 
myselt at the grated parlour<C)r the Convent. The 
Lady Abbess soon jomed me and, after the usual 
compliments, conducted me to her own private 
apartments, where a young lady, as pale as a 
corpse, arose from the sofa and threw her feeble 
arms about my neck. 

I gazed on her palid features with doubt and 
astonishment. 
" Have you forgotten me ?" she asked. 
It was Laura! but how dreadfully changed! 
she was an absolute skeleton, and her eyes seemed 
fixed as in death. I burst into tears. 

** Your poor friend is much changed," said the 
Lady Abbess in a tone of commiseration, 
e'"^ Miss Laura is indeed changed, I replied, but 
under your kind protection, she will, I trust in 
Heaven, soon recover. 
Laura now sunk on her couch, exhausted with 


30 CLAltA GAZUL. 

the ertbrt she had made, to embrace me. The 
Lady Abbess easily prevailed on me to pass a few 
days with the poor invalid, and the servant was 
dispatched with my excuse to the Lady Polignac. 
After advising Laura to open her mind to me, the 
Lady Abbess left us together. 

As soon as we were alone, Laura begged me 
to sit close to her, as her voice was feeble. She 
wept bitterly, and seemed so agitated, that I pre- 
vailed on her to postpone her communication to 
the following day. In the mean time, I strove to 
divert her mind, by conversing on such general 
subjects as could have no power to recall the 
past. 

'; The Lady Abbess visited us in the evening, and 
invited me to sup with her. I slept in the room 
with Laura, whose sleep was disturbed by fear- 
ful dreams, from which she awoke more agitated 
than refreshed, We breakfasted on the following 
morning at a very early hour, after which Laura 
finding herself somewhat calmer, commenced the 


CLARA GAZUL. 31 

relation of her sad adventures in about the fol- 
lowing words : 

*' You may remember, Clara, that the Cardinal 
Poco-puranti's attentions to me were ever the most 
delicate and flattering. Already impressed with 
a high opinion of his beauty and merits, I soon 
began to think of him with a degree of romantic 
tenderness which I mistook for the mere respect 
due to his superior qualifications. How have I 
hung upon his Words ! How graceful seemed to 
me his language! How noble, yet pleasing 
the lofty expression of his fine countenance I 

*' The good but imprudent Signora Poco-pu- 
ranti, his sister, encouraged our frequent tetes a 
tete with a view that his Eminence should in- 
struct me in my religion, and prepare me for my 
first communion. Each day my passion increas- 
ed, and I began to look forward to my destined 
marriage, with dread and disgust. 

'* The Cardinal had not yet breathed a syllable 
to me that might not have been listened to by 
the whole world, although his eyes were often 


32 CLARA GAZUL. 

fixed on my face with an expression of the most 
marked tenderness and admiration. As my me- 
lancholy increased, the Cadinal's manner of ad- 
dressing me became more soft and touching. 

" One evening when his sister had just retired 
to her room, he surprised me in tears — I turned 
away my head and held my handkerchief to my 
eyes. 

" Laura," said the Cardinal, drawing a chair 
near mine, *' your grief affects me more than it 
ought. If I dared flatter myself that you would 
consider me worthy of your confidence." 

*' I sobbed aloud. 

** Speak Laura, dear Laura, tell me I intreat 
you what distresses you," said the Cardinal. 

" My marriage, I replied, my marriage has 
become hateful to my thoughts, and surely, my 
Lord, it would be a hard, a dreadful fate to be 
forced into the arms of one, I feel, I could never 
love. 

" The Cardinal soothed me with the tenderest 
expressions that the most delicate friendship could 


(LARA (iAZUL. 3.'i 

dictate. I was badly brought up, my feelings 
had hitherto been under no restraint. 

** The Cardinal soon discovered my passion 
for him. He was a man of luxurious habits, and 
in the vigour of life. Opportunities of seeing me 
in private, were never wanting. 

" Clara, you have long since, I know, guessed 
the rest, and I shall not astonish you with con- 
fession, that when I left the Cardinal's protection, 
I was pregnant by him;" Laura paused, and shed 
a few tears, which she hastily brushed from her 
cheek with her handkerchief, and continued as 
follows : 

" I am descended from one of the noblest and 

proudest families in Italy. My father counted his 

ancestors as far back as three hundred years. My 

marriage with a Catholic nobleman, whose name 

I must now forbear to mention, was decided on 

between our parents, as soon as I was born. 

From the hour that I became guilty, my forbod- 

ing heart told me that my fate was fixed in 

night.: 
Vol. II. f 


.*34 Cl^AKA GAZUL. 

I am ail orphan, entirely dependent on my 
brother, whose lofty pride of birth and natural 
severity I dreaded. Yet, I loved the Cardinal 
with the most devoted passion, and in our hours 
of guilty enjoyment, all was forgotten but the 
happiness of the moment. But I was soon to 
awaken from my feverish dream of fancied bliss, 
by the discovery of my pregnancy ! What nights 
and days of bitter anguish did that circumstance 
occasion me. 

The Cardinal was deeply aflected at my suffer- 
ing, but his reputation was dear to him ; so dear 
that I fear he would have sacrificed me to pre- 
serve it unimpeached. 

" I will do all that a man in my situation can 
do/' said the Cardinal, "to atone for the misfor- 
fortune I have been the occasion of ; my fortune, 
my life is at your service, but not my character, 
he would say, should that be impeached, and if 
through your means , I see the Hnger of scorn 
pointed at me, Laura, I shall become your ene- 
my." 


CLAKA GAZUL. 3j 

"At these harsh words, I was deeply affected, 
and shed the bitterest tears that ever fell from my 
eyes. 

** The Cardinal endeavoured to soothe my 
agitation of mind. 

" * I am rich,* said he, * I will place you out 
of the reach of your brother's indignation, and I 
will pass as much of my time with you as my 
duties will permit.' 

I listened with avidity to this proposal, for I 
still dearly loved my seducer, and could not en- 
dure the idea of being ever separated from him. 
The Cardinal Poco-puranti possesses a most use- 
ful and convenient friend in the poor besotted 
curate. Father Pietro. This priest is the dupe of 
any man who wears the garb of religion ; nothing 
is too extravagant for his credulity ; it would, 
therefore, have been easy to have engaged the poor 
man in our interests. 

The Cardinal had made known to him his 
wishes with regard to my departure under Pie- 
tro's protection, and a retired elegant cottage was 


^0 CLAli.V GAZUL. 

hired for my residence, at some leagues from 
Naples. The difficulty which delayed us was 
that of procuring an eligible female companion, 
whose discretion might be depended on. 

'* After much consideration, we had nearly de- 
cided that I should intrust you with our fatal se- 
cret, and implore you to be the companion of my 
solitude. Alas! my crime was not to remain 
unpunished. I received the following letter from 
my brother on the very day I had made up my 
mind to open my heart to you : 

Laura, 
" * Reports to your dishonour are circulating in 
" Naples ; — to be brief, you are supposed to be 
•* pregnant. Dr. Stacato, of the King's household, 
" who met you at a converzatione, at the Mar- 
** chionesss de la Croix, declared in the presence 
" of several of the Royal Family, that he firmly 
'* believed my sister was pregnant. 

*• * Should this assertion be false, I shall know 
know how to punish the calumniator, but if you 


CL/VKA GAZUL. 37 

" indeedjhave been so lost to shame, so forgetful 
" of your liigh descent, and if you do desire that 
** I should not destroy myself, you will meet me 

"immediately at Hotel, which is only three 

" leagues from your present residence, that I may 
" conduct you to a retired Castello, which by in- 
" heritance, has long been mine, in order to con- 
" ceal your shame from the world ; your waiting 
" woman may accompany you. 

*' I suspect the Cardinal ; — If you value his 
" safety— if you would not see him weltering in 
" his blood, hasten to meet me, and enter into 
" no explanations with either the Cardinal or 
" his sister, but contrive to leave the Castello 
" while they are absent. 

*' * I will, on your arrival here, write to inform 
** the family that you are under my protection — 
" your fate and mine are :n your hands. 

" * Be obedient, act prudently, and all may yet 
" be well, 

*• * Your distracted but affectionate Brother, 
" ' The Count de I F ." 


38 CLARA GAZUL. 

*' Oil the receipt of this letter my agitation be- 
came so great that it was with the greatest dif- 
ficulty I accomplished the necessary preparations 
for my departure. Cruelly alarmed for the father 
of that infant, who lived in my bosom, lest his 
safety might be endangered by my delay, a prey to 
the most tormenting remorse, I departed with my 
woman Esterre, in a hired conveyance, after having 
with a trembling hand traced two letters, one for 
you, and the other for the Lady Poco-puranti. 

I here ackowledged the receipt of the hand- 
some ring which Laura had made me a present of, 
with many thanks, and she then proceeded thus: 

" My brother's reception of me was kinder 
than I expected. He spoke but little on that 
evening, but as soon as we had dined, advised 
me to retire to bed, alledging that I looked haggard 
and fatigued. I passed a sleepless night. 

" The idea that I should never again be permit- 
ted to see my seducer absorbed all my thoughts, 
and in the bitterness of my anguish, I prayed to 


CLARA GA7.UL 3<) 

be relieved by death from my suflferings and de- 
spair. 

** After breakfast, the next morning, my bro- 
ther having secured the door of our apartment ; 
addressed me as follows : 

" * Laura, I will spare you the painful avowal. 
I know your situation, and that the Cardinal was 
your seducer !' — I threw myself on my knees at 
the feet of my brother. — Take pity on me Lean- 
dro, befriend your poor orphan sister, in her ap- 
proaching hour of trial ! Remember she has no 
protector but yourself 

" * Arise Laura,* said my brother, raising me, 
* what can you have to fear from me your rela- 
tive? But there is no time to loose; you are, I 
believe, in a very advanced state of pregnancy. 
The honor of our noble house is at stake, and the 
least imprudence or delay will ruin all. 

" We must get rid of your woman Esterre, un- 
der some plausible pretext this very night.* 

" Alas! she is kind hearted and intelligent, and 
would be a great comfort to me, said I, while the 


40 CLARA GAZUL. 

slow tears chased each otljer down my cheek. 
* Imposible/ replied my brother, * your woman is 
a Neapolitan. Have you no pride, and would 
you see your brother a prey toeverlastmg shame 
Would you excite him to crimes to appease his 
vengeance? 

" Ah ! Heavens forbid, Leandro, said I, be it 
then as you please, I will complain no more. I 
would I were in my grave with my parents, for 
I am sick of life. 

"My brother reproached me for want of firm- 
ness and insisted on my immediately dismissing 
my favorite and faithful attendant. We both 
shed tears at parting. My brother refused to 
leave us one moment alone, but permitted me in 
his presence, to make a handsome present to Es- 
terra I saw her depart with a desponding heart. 
My brother, soon atter her departure, informed 
me that he should travel all night, as w^e had a 
long journey to make before we could arrive at 
the retired residence, where he had chosen to con- 
ceal my disgrace. 


CLARA GAZUr. 41 

" I coul<l only bow, tears choakecl niv utter- 
ance. I went into my room to prepare tor my 
departure, and as I w as about to tie on my hat, 
I observed a small letter pinned into the crown of 
it, which contained these words; 

" My dearest young lady. Heaven knows with 
" what regret I am forced to leave you. 

** I pray God all may be well. You have ever 
'* been the kindest mistress to me, and I would 
'* live with you in poverty and in sickness, rather 
" than with the richest lady in all Italy. 

" Should my respectful and affectionate ser- 
" vices ever be required, a line to the enclosed 
" address, will be sure to fmd me, and I will tra- 
" vel any distance to do your service.

** A gleam of comfort enlivened for an instant

most grateful did I leel to my afVectionate wait- 
ing woman, for this proof of her legard. Hav- 
ing concealed this letter carefully in my bosom^ 
I hastily descended into the sitting room, equip- 
ped for my melancholy journey. 

We started at about five in the evening in a 
close carriage, drawn by four swift horses. The 
weather was sultry, the same postillions accom- 
panied us the whole of the night. The first time 
we stopped to change horses was at a wild look- 
ing place, where the horses were in waiting for 
us at the door of a hut. 

" My brother alighted, but desired me to re- 
main quiet. I saw him address a man who stood 
at the door of the hut, and seemed to have been 
watching our approach. They spoke in German, 
a language I do not understand, and the stranger 
often seemed to look towards the carriage, so as to 
lead me to imagine myself the subject of their 
discourse. He wore the dress of a Friar, and 
his features were completely concealed under his 
cowl. 


CLARA (JAZUL. 4;j 

** In a lew minutes he mounted a handsome bay 
horse that was fastened to a tree, when our car- 
riage being ready, we all departed together. The 
Friar seldom addressed my brother, but rode si- 
lently by the side of our equipage. 

** I was exhausted towards morning, and in- 
treated my brother to allow me to alight. 

** * We have but three leagues more to travel,' 
said he, * when w^e shall arrive at a farm, where 
you may have a draught of milk.* 

" Will the father accompany us to the end of 
our journey ? I ventured to enquire. 

** * Laura,' replied my brother, in a stern voice, 
* I cannot converse with you with temper, so 
much do I take to heart your having dishonoured 
our family.' 

*• Let us continue silent, or I shall else say 
what may wound you to the quick.' 

*' I sunk back in the carriage with a heavy sigh, 
and was silent. 

" When we arrived at the farm my brother had 
mentioned, we were received by a thin old wo- 


44 CLARA (iAZt'L. 

man, who invited us to enter. She soon served 
us with milk and eggs, of which my brother and 
myself partook in silence. The Friar did not join 
us. In less than a quarter of an hour we were 
again on our road. We only stopped once more 
(luring the whole of the day, and then only for 
half an hour, to partake under the shade of some 
fine oak trees, the refreshment which my brother 
produced from the carriage. 

Towards night, I was really ill, and I assured 
my brother that I felt quite unequal to the task 
of continuing my journey another night. 

" My brother seemed greatly discomposed, but 
promised that he would alight at midnight I 
anxiously intreated to learn to what place we were 
travelling, whilst my brother used every precau- 
tion to keep me in ignorance of our route. 

" At last we stopped before a tolerable looking 
inn, in a small fishing town. It was, I guessed, 
about one hour after midnight. My brother or- 
dered a bed to be prepared for me, to which he 
conducted me himself, when having commanded 


CLAKA (;azul. 45 

refreshments, and seen it placed on my table, he 
left me to my dismal reflections, locked my door 
on the outside, and took out the key. 

" Alas! What will become of me — what means 
this dreadful mystery ? I inwardly exclaimed ! I 
could not eat, and vainly did I endeavour to 
drown my harassed senses in sleep.

CONTINUATION OF LAURA'S HISTORY. 

•• I Arose unrefreshed, to throw myself on my 
knees, and to implore the Father of all good to 
give me comfort. Vague suspicions of future evil 
and danger haunted my mind. 'I'he sinister ex- 
pression which my brother sometimes threw into 
his countenance, made my blood run cold, 

'* Oh ! that I could escape, I inwardly exclaim- 
ed, throwing up the sash of my small window 
in order to examine my situation. 

By the light of the moon, I could see that my 
apartment overlooked a modern kitchen garden. 
Not a leaf was stirring. Suddenly I heard the 
distant sound of human voices. — They approached 
nearer, and I was almost certain that two persons 


CLAKA li AZVL. 4? 

were conversing in a low voice. I iiastily dark- 
ened my lamp in order to avoid observation. 
'I\vo figures now appeared under my u in low. 
These were no doubt my brother and ilit- I riar 
who travelled with us on horseback. 

'* 'IMiey spoke in a low tone, and it was some 
time before my ear could catch a syllable of their 
conversation. At length I distinctly overheard 
these words in my brother's voice. 

** * I like not our plan — We shall one day, I 
fear, repent of having fixed upon this Castello. 
There is danger in it — Strange things have come 
to light — What if they should meet ? 

** * Hush! Speak low,' said the Friar, pointing 
to the of window of my apartment. 

" * She has extinguished her light, and has re- 
tired to her couch,' answered my brother. 

'• They now bent their steps onwards, and I 
lost what they said. — Again they passed my win- 
dow, when I heard my brother address these 
words to the Friar in an angry voice.

to thee. Thou knowest what thou was't, — who 
it was who saved thy life, and raised thee to what 
thou art. Thou knoweston what our future fate 
depends ; this plan is thine own, remember, and 
that I have ever objected to it as fraught with 
risks and danger. 

"*What,* replied the Friar in anger, wouldst 
thou forego thy revenge ? Shall our ho[)es and 
rights be trampled upon by a viper of the church, 
and shall We smile tamely on the insult and our 
degradation ? ' 

" * Be it so then, since the brother countenan- 
ces the dishonor of his house.' 

" * Rather,' answered my brother would I with 

my own hands The rest of this speech was 

uttered in a low^ whisper which I could not dis- 
tinguish, 

" I was seized with a cold shivering, my 
heart seemed to die within me, scarcely could I 
support myself to my bed, where I sunk dowti, 
as I imagine, in a fainting fit. 

"On opening my eyes^ T perceived that day

light was fast approaching. Exhausted more from 
mental sufferings than bodily fatigue, I at length 
fell into a feverish sleep, from which I did not 
thoroughly awake until my brother entered my 
room, accompanied by an old female, dressed in 
the garb worn by the lower and most abject order 
of German peasants. 

" She placed on mv table a cup of warm milk, 
a small loaf, and a roasted rabbit. My brother 
without inquiring after my health, or remarking 
my haggard appearance, recommended me to use 
dispatch, adding, that our horses would shortly 
be ready for us to pursue our journey. I would 
have spoken, but he waived his hand, as if to for- 
bid my addressing him, and hastened out of the 
room. 

" How to account for this cruelty I knew not 
My brother had ever passed in the world for a 
man of pious habits during my father's life time, 
in spite of the violence of his temper.

death took place in Spain, where he had accom-

panied my brother, and destined husband, on par- 
ticular business. 

" One month after their arrival at Madrid, I 
received from my brother the melancholy news 
of my parent's death, which was occasioned as 
he told me, by a malignant fever, that carried 
him oft' in three days. 

*' My brother had the last solemn rites perfor- 
med with regal magnificence, and then took pos- 
session of the large estates to which he was heir. 
My parent's ashes were conveyed by easy stages 
to the family vaults of our ancestors, attended by 
my brother. 

** Since the death of my only parent, for I lost 
my mother in infancy, I have seldom seen either 
my brother, or he who was destined for my future 
husband. I heard that the strictest intimacy ex- 
isted between them. 

My brother made frequent visits to Spain, leav- 
ing me to the care of an old aunt of my mother's, 
who resided near Florence. There I was suffered 
to follow in all things the bent of my inclinations. 


CLARA GAZUL. 51 

The Governess provided for me by my aunt, who 
was almost in her dotage, indulged me in every 
childish whim. I never read or studied, but at 
my own good will and pleasure. 

** The lady Poco-puranti, was a distant relation 
of my mother's. Her goodness of heart prompt- 
ed her to represent to my brother, in a letter, the 
necessity that existed for my change of residence, 
since my aunt, from her advanced age, was un- 
equal to the task of directing my studies, or in- 
stilling into my mind the firm principles of reli- 
gion, which should be my future guide through 
life. The Lady Poco-puranti concluded her let- 
ter by proposing to take charge of me with the 
assistance of the Cardinal, until the period ap- 
pointed for my marriage. 

** My brother consented, and requested her to 
prepare two rooms in her Castello, for the recep- 
tion of myself and woman. 

" I had resided, I think, about three months 
at the Cardinal's, when you, Clara, were invited 


UNIVERSITY OF 
ILLINOIS LlBRARt 


b'l CLARA GAZUL. 

to be my companion, but I will endeavour to pro- 
ceed with my dreadful story. 

** Having hastily and sparingly partaken of my 
breakfast, my brother led me towards the carri- 
age, that was waiting for us, when having pla- 
ced himself by my side, and drawn down the 
blinds, we proceeded along a rough unfrequented 
path at a good smart pace. The heat soon be- 
came intense. I was miserably ill, and my mouth 
was parched with feverish thirst. 

** I endeavoured, however, to calm my agitated 
spirits, and determined in my mind that I would 
make an attempt to escape from the dreaded per- 
secution of my brother. I was not permitted to 
alight again during five long days and nights 
that we travelled, save for a few minutes, and that 
rarely, in order to obtain the most pressing neces- 
sities to sustain life. 

** My brother, with obstinate perseverance, re- 
fused to converse with me. He seemed rapt in 
anxious reflexions. Reclined in a corner of the 
carriage, with his brow bent, his face half con- 


CLARA GAZUL. 53 

cealed in his cloak, he preserved the most impene- 
trable silence. The carriage was amply provided 
with wine, and the most delicate refreshments. 

" The Friar occasionally entered the carriage for 
a few hours, to avoid the burning heat of the 
sunny atmosphere, but I did not hear him utter a 
single syllable, neither could I catch a glimpse of 
his features, so completely were they concealed 
by his large cowl. 

" At length after we had been a week or more 
on the road, we arrived by means of an unfre- 
quented and dangerous path within sight of the 
strongest and most ancient looking castle (ruin 
rather) that I had ever beheld. 

** My brother now descended and addressed the 
|/ostillions. I observed that they unharnessed 
their horses, when having acknowledged with the 
most abject appearance of gratitude, the present 
of gold which my brother placed in the hand of 
each, they led I heir horses onwards, and were 
soon out of sight. 

.*' I am then alone, perhaps, with my execution- 


54 CLARA GAZUL. 

ers, thought I. The thick gathering twilight be- 
gan to obscure the surrounding rich scenery — the 
last red flash oF the setting sun, fell on the dark 
ruin before me, and tinted the ivy on it*s battle- 
ments with a glowing hue. 

" * Take my arm,* said my brother, * the ascent 
to the castle is rough and steep. 

The Friar advanced on before us, and his dark 
shadowy figure as it was disappearing in the mist 
of the evening, added a striking feature to the bold 
scenery. 

" Before we arrived at the gates of this ancient 
edifice, our ears were assailed by the sound of a 
heavy bell. We contrived to reach the moss- 
grown yard, which appeared to have been recently 
used as a burial place, by the poor inhabitants of 
some adjoining village. 

Rude crosses and devices cut out in wood were 
scattered among the trees. After frequent appli- 
cations to the rusty bell, we heard the sound 
of bolts and bars which seemed to be withdrawn 
with much difliculty, and we had waited nearly a 


CLAKA GA7.UL •^•'> 

quarter of an hour, when the gales were slowly 
dragged open, with a creaking sound, and a hag- 
gard female stood forward, to invite us into this 
dismal abode. 

*' Never, Clara, shall I be able to convey to 
your mind the horror and fear with which this 
woman's appearance inspired me. 

" She was just passing the meridian of life. Her 
height was commanding, her features regular, but 
in their expression lurked the cunning viciousness 
of a demon. 

" She was thin and haggard, and her dark raven 
coloured lock» escaping from the confinement of 
a red kerchief, which was bound about her tem- 
ples, in something of the German fashion, fell 
lank and wild about her face and ears. A simple 
short robe or jacket of dark grey stuff, was con- 
fined at the waist with a yellow ribbon. Her 
petticoat had been made of costly materials, but 
the quilted yellow satin was worn thread bare. 
On her neck was carelessly fastened a rich but 
dirtv Indian handkerchief.

'* Something in the aspect of this woman, 
seemed to denote thai she had seen better 
days. 

** * Ye are come at last,' said the woman in Ita- 
lian. She spoke that language with a foreign ac- 
cent. 

" Behind her stood a tall gaunt-looking male 
figure, habited in a grey smock frock. My bro- 
ther addressed the female in German. She made 
signs to the man, who I soon discovered was both 
deaf and dumb. 

" With the assistance of a labourer, whom he 
went in search of, our equipage was dragged into 
a sort of dilapidated building which probably 
had once been used as stabling. 

" Whilst the Friar and my brother were occu- 
pied with the carriage and my luggage, the wo- 
man, whose name was Bianca, with a scowling 
countenance, beckoned me to follow her. I obey- 
ed in silence, my heart being too full for utter- 
ance. 

Bianca led the way up a narrow flight of wind- 


CLARA GAZUL. 57 

ing stone stairs, which were so worn and decay- 
ed, as to render our ascent in the twilight danger- 
ous. 

" * I will go into the kitchen for a lanthorn,* 
said the woman, observing that I stumbled at 
every step. I waited her retnrn in mute despair. 

"At last she made her appearance, and by the 
faint light of her lamp, after ascending the peril- 
ous staircase, I was conducted through a long 
dark gallery, at the extremity of which I observ- 
ed a huge massive oak door, secured on the out- 
side by a ponderous iron bar. 

Bianca having with difficulty removed it, we 
entered a dismal apartment, the walls of which 
had the appearance of having once been hung 
with curious tapestry, which now was moulder- 
ing into dust, and falling from the wall. 

" This dark melancholy room, communicated 
with a smaller one, which presented a more cheer- 
ful aspect ; it seemed to have been recently put in 

order. The walls were hung with old portraits,

which were nearly defaced and disfigured by 
time, but they had been dusted and repaired. 

" Atone end of the room stood a bed which 
had once been magnificent, but the rich purple 
hangings were worm eaten, and corresponded 
with the pictures. The bed clothes, however, 
were clean and comfortable, and an old couch was 
placed near a curious antique table, covererl with 
an embroidered cloth. A few books and a guitar 
lay on a gothic marble slab, and on a buffet, in 
a recess, I found tea and coffee service with 
various trifles that were evidently placed there 
for my accommodation. 

I was glowing callous and stubborn from de- 
spair, but at sight of these trifling preparations 
that evince'] a degree of humanity in my brother, 
of which I had began to think him utterly desti- 
tute, I burst into a violent flood of tears 

'* * rs nd are you then dissatisfied with your 
apartment after all the pains that has been taken 
to make you comfortable,' enquired Bianca sharp- 


CLARA UA/UL. 4J) 

*' I guessed it vvoulil be my interest to conciliate 
her, if possible, I therefore mildly expressed my 
gratitude for her attention. 

" * Bestow your thanks where they are due/ 
said Bianca, rudely, a<lding, * your brother's will 
is law here, I am but his slave, else you might 
have taken things as you had found them. They 
had served me, and might you. This delicate 
couch was prepared for my reception, when I was 
invited hither* 

*' Disgusted with this unfeeling woman, I re- 
quested to be left alone. 

" * You'll have as much of your own company 
as you can desire,' said Bianca, and placing my 
lamp on the table, she stalked out of the room, 
but soon returned wiih refreshments of various 
kinds. Having placed them on a table, and point- 
ed to a bell which hung near the bed, she once 
more retired, and I heard her fasten my door with 
the iron bar. 

It was now that feeling myself for the first time 
in my life alone, and dependant on my own re-

sources, that I felt my courage increase with the 
occasion of its exertion. * Sufficient for the day 
is the evil thereof,' said I, drying my tears. Let 
me not despair of obtaining my freedom. 

My first object must be, to preserve my health 
and strength. The air struck chill and damp ; 
there was a quantity of dry fuel prepared on the 
hearth, which I lighted, and soon produced a 
cheering blaze. I then sat down to supper with 
some slight degree of appetite, and swallowed a 
glass of excellent Spanish wine, from which I felt 
much refreshed. 

" My supper being concluded, I began to ex- 
amine my apartment,! had read of sliding pannels 
in almost every romance that had fallen into my 
hands, but here, in this old crumbling castle, 
where they ought to have abounded, not one was 
to be discovered. 

" Adjoining my bed room to the left, was a 
dressing closet, but it had no communication with 
any other apartment. 

" The windows were so high that it was neces- 


CLAJtA GXZUL. Ql 

sary to mount on a chair in order tu reach them, 
and when mounted, I could see nothing but the 
sky. I had disturbed a quantity of owls, th^t now 
made a dismal noise about my ears. 

" I examined the few books that lay on the 
marble, slab. They were chiefly light works, fit 
to amuse the hour, written in the Italian lan- 
guage. 'I'he guitar was in good condition, and 
there was a music book of old German romances. 

" Vainly did I search for some clue to guide 
me as to where I was. It might be Germany, or 
Spain, I could not help guessing, it was the lat- 
ter, from various triffling circumstances, which 
during my journey attracted my attention. 

" The excessive fatigue I had undergone was 
no longer to be resisted, and placing my lamp on 
the table near my bed side, and arming myself 
with my supper-knife, I threw myself on my 
bed, and slept soundly for seven 1 hours. 

** The glare of the morning sun which had pe- 
netrated my bed curtains, at length awoke mc. I 
ventured to touch the bell which hung bv mv side.

*' it was answered slowly by Bianca, who 
brought me some bread and a cup of chocolate. 

" I'^equested that my trunk might be brought 
to me. 

•' The woman merely nodded sulkily, and was 
leaving the room. 

" Stay my good Bianca, said I to her beseech- 
ly, stay I intreat you — I am a poor unhappy girl, 
I am pregnant, and in three weeks I shall become 
a mother ! I threw myself on my knees at her 
feet. 

" * Such pity as the wolf shews the lamb, shalt 
thou and all thy base progeny have at my hands; 
for know thy mother was a serpent in my path : 
'twas thy father's falsehood that stamped these 
premature wrinkles deep upon my brow — his trea- 
chery that made me the loathsome thing I am — 
but revenge ! — Revenge has been mine, and shall 
be mine,' said Bianca, fixing her dark eyes on my 
face with an expression of malice, the most fiend . 
like and determined, while her vivid lips quivered, 


CLARA GAZUL. 03 

and her whole appearauce inspired the most apal- 
Hng sensations in my breast. 

** Leave me then to my fate, said I, God is all 
powerful, and may yet save me, even though men 
have turned their hearts against me. 

* Bianca darted on me a glance of furious 
exultation, and then left me to my \^ retched 
thoughts. 

" Three weeks rolled away in the same uni- 
form manner. Bianca visited me twice each 
day, to bring my meals which were well served. 
Dfeading the sound of her voice, 1 had ceased to 
address her. My hours were spent chiefly in 
prayer to the Giver of all good, that he would 
preserve me in my hour of trial. 

" 1 attempted once to strike the chords of the 
guitar, and accompany a hymn with my voice, 
that my father had composed, and taught me to 
sing in infancy. It was midnight! Not a breath 
was stirring, when nje-thought I heard the faint 
echo of foot steps at a great distance, and then 
the sound of some one opening a door or the sash 


64 CLARA GAZUL. 

of a window, but all was so vague and distant, 
that it might be the owls, or the wind. Again 
I exerted my trembling voice, and sang the se- 
cond couplet of my favorite hymn. A fine bass 
voice sounded faintly in the distance, chaunting 
the accompaniment in just such notes, as my de- 
parted father's. 

** Oft had we sung the hymn together — I could 
scarcely be mistaken, yet my ear had only caught 
a sound, w hich was distant and vague. 

*' My heart beat violently, — a mysterious feeling 
of rapture possessed every faculty. I suppres- 
sed my breath, removed my hair from my ears, 
and stood immoveably fixed to the spot. Again 
I thought I heard the sound of footsteps, and 
again the last couplet of my hymn was warbled 
by a bass voice which resembled strongly my 
late father's. 

*• I never believed in supernatural stories of 
ghosts or spirits, yet now when my nerves were 
weakened by my suffering, I almost hoped that 
the spirit of my beloved parent, was permitted 


CLARA GAZUL. 6'5 

to watch over me, to defeat the fiend-like malice 
of Bianca. 

How could my father have injured this wo- 
man? Where could he have known her, and at 
what period ? All was a fearful mystery. 

'* My hour of trial approached, my brother 
had not once visited me, nor had I seen any hu- 
man being, during my confinement, save Bianca 
and her dumb man, who occasionally assisted 
her to clean my apartment. Vainly did I watch 
for some expression of kindness or compassion in 
this man's heavy German features. He gave me 
ever but an unmeaning stare. Once I contrived to 
shew him a gold piece, which I held in my hand : 
Bianca was employed in the adjoining closet. The 
man took the piece, and immediately carried it 
to her. The beldame, in a fury, seized my arm, 
and shook it so violently, that I was attacked 
with an hysterical afi'ection, which terminated ia 
the pangs of labour. 

*' Have you no surgeon at hand ? I feebly ar- 
ticulated; Is there no help for the wretched

Laura? Oh! God of mercies, what has my se- 
ducer to answer for ! and HE can enjoy existence 
in the luxury of his palace, indulging his pamper- 
ed appetites, while his wretched victim is left to 
perish in tortures. 

" If, continued I, in a paroxysm of despair, 
throwing myself on the ground, and raising my 
eyes to Bianca's face — If there exist one particle 
of pity in your breast — If you were born of wo- 
man, and hope for mercy hereafter, seek out a 
surgeon! — Send for my brother ! — Let me not pe- 
rish with my living, but unborn babe. — Consider 
I implore you, my extreme youth — scarcely yet 
seventeen years of age. 

" * I was but little older when thy parent de- 
stroyed all my earthly hopes,' said Bianca, add- 
ing with an exulting snjile: * fear not! thy brother 
shall soon attend thee, neither shall help be de- 
nied thee in thy need.' 

•* She then hastily left the room, and in less 
than an hour returned, leading in a most extra- 
ordinary personage, of prodigious height, dressed 


CLARA GAZUL. (J? 

m a red patched jacket! Sharp misery seemed 
to have worn him to the mere anatomy of a man ; 
the sleeves, of his vest scarcely reached to the 
middle of his bony arm; his legs were thrust into 
a pair of red worsted stockings, which reached 
above his knees, and he wore a pair of old slash- 
ed damask breeches, which had once been yel- 
low, and on his head, a wretched hat in the form 
of a sugar loaf, 

** He was a man of about fifty years of age, or 
less, with a beak nose, a narrow face, and cheek 
bones so high, that they nearly concealed his two 
sharp peering grey eyes. 

" * Here is the surgeon of the adjoining village, 
come to render thee assistance,' said Bianca, 
and then, although the weather was sultry, she 
began to busy herself m preparing a quantity of 
fuel on the hearth. 

" Vainly did I assure her that the heat was 
already insupportable. All my objections were 
overruled, and a tremendous fire soon blazed, the 


(58 CLARA C.'AZUL. 

heat of which, quite overpowered me, and I faint- 
ed. 

Too soon, oh God ! did I return to life. — 
My tortures were protacted fifteen hours longer ; 
my cries resounded through the hall. The miser- 
able doctor trembled from head to loot, and ren- 
dered me scarcely any assistance, although he 
struck me as possessing both skill and knowledge 
in his profession. 

** Two figures in black cloaks and masks ho- 
vered around my bed, like the spirits of darkness. 
The red blaze tinted the ashy features of Bianca, 
as she kindled the flame with demoniacal expres- 
sion. My senses were confused — methought I 

was in the regions of purgatory. Clara, I must 

hurry over this appalling part of my shocking 
story, or it will even now distract my brain. 

Laura's eyes were raised wildly to heaven, lier 
pale lips quivered. Alarmed by her agitation, I 
pressed the poor weak girl in my arms, kissed her 
cheek, and implored her to defer the conclusion 
of her dreadful tale till another time. 


CLARA UA/.UL. 69 

*' "I'is soon told, and I would not, whilst I live 
have to recur to it after to-day," said Laura, and 
hastily swallowing a few drops, after a pause, 
she continued as follows: 

** My infant was at length born. I heard his 
plaintiff' cry. I saw his little angel form, with 
all a mother's joy. My child lived ! HIS child 
lived, and sweet hope entered into my heart." 

Laura's convulsive sobs here choaked her ut- 
terance, and for several minutes sp)eech was de- 
nied her. 

Say no more, Laura, let me guess the horrid 
story, and spare you the relation of a tale so mon- 
strous, so shocking to humanity. 

" One instant, and I have done," said Laura, 
and she continued thus: 

** Perish the fruits of thy dishonor ! — The 
shame of a noble house! — To the flames with him 
Bianca ! said a hollow voice, proceeding from 
one of the masked dark figures — Oh ! mighty 
God I! — The fiend obeyed spite of the efforts 
made by the doctor to preserve the pure vie- 


rfQ CLARA GAZUL. 

tim. I saw the body of my infant struggling in 
the flames! and yet I live! ! 

Laura's voice, in uttering this last expression, 
was raised to frenzy ; she tore her hair from its 
confinement, and her eyes became fixed for an 
instant, when she fell senseless on the floor. — My 
arms had in some measure broken her fall. — 
Trembling, and sick at heart, from sympathy, 
with the unhappy Laura, I with difl^iculty pla- 
ced her on her bed, and rang for assistance. 

The friendly Abbess soon made her appear- 
ance, followed by several nuns, who, exerted 
themselves with tender zeal, for the relief of the 
poor novice, who did not recover till the next 
day, when she continued her melancholy tale, in 
about these words : 

" God was merciful to me, and locked my sen- 
ses in oblivion, from the instant that the dread- 
ful scene had struck my afflicted sight. I have 
no recollection of what afterwards befel me, for 
a period of more than three weeks, during which 
time I lay in a raging fever. 


ci-AHA c;AzrL. 71 

** The first circumstance I can call to mind 
was, that I opened my eyes as from a deep sleep, 
and fixed them on the venerable face of my de- 
parted father ! ! 

The sight of that dear parent, whom I felt 
convinced I had followed to his grave, inspired 
me with the idea that I had ceased to live, and 
was in Heaven. 

*' I smiled tenderly and happily in my father's 
face, and stretched forward my languid hand 
for him to embrace. 

*' * Do you know me then, my child,' said the 
venerable figure ? 

'* Joy, the purest joy that ever illumined the 
face of a mortal, shone in his eyes, when I called 
him my beloved father ! 

" I soon closed my eyes again and obtained 
several hours of refreshing sleep. The crisis of 
my disorder had passed. My youth and consti- 
tution had enabled me to survive the painful or- 
deal of human suffering. 

" On awakening this time, I saw only my fa- 


7*2 CLARA CAZUL. 

vorite woman, Esterre, who sat at her embroider- 
ing frame close to my bedside. What comfort 
did the sight of her benevolent countenance af- 
ford me ! 

" Esterre, said I, thank God you are here ; I 
have had frightful dreams. I pressed my hand to 
my forehead ; — There is still much confusion in 
my brain, said I, Do not leave me again Esterre, 

promise me you will not, and I paused and 

cast a frightened look around the room But 

are they gone ? — Will they come no more? I 
whispered. »* 

"You are with friends, dear Miss Laura, who 
will protect you, but you are too weak to con- 
verse. In a few days you shall hear pleasing news : 
wait only till your nerves can support it. 

My recovery was very slow, but when at 
length, I was able to converse, I learned the fol- 
lowing particulars from the mouth of my revered 
parent, for it was indeed himself who related his 
story. 

** ' Vain would I bury in oblivion the memory 


CLARA GAZUL. 73 

of a son, whose vices cause me to shudder at the 
idea of being his parent. I cannot, my child, 
dwell on a subject so painful, but must briefly 
give you only the heads of my sad story. 

" * The violence of your brother's temper, 
and his ungovernable pride of birth, you may re- 
member, had long caused me the deepest afflic- 
tion. It was in the vain hope of estranging him 
from a set of profligate friends, that I accom- 
panied him on a , tour through Germany and 
Spain. 

This old ruinous castle, situated on the borders 
of Spain, was bequeathed to your grandfather, by 
the will of an old and dear friend, who had 
fought by his side in various campaigns ; your 
brother affected to feel the strongest curiosity to 
visit this inheritance of mine, alledging that he 
had heard its surrounding scenery extolled be- 
yond any in this part of the world. 

*' * Willing to indulge, him I accompanied him 
here ; we remained more than a month in the 

Vol. II. L 


74 CLAIJA GAZUL. 

neighbourhood during which period, we made fre- 
quent excursions to the castle. 

One day we discovered a small narrow staircase 
which had hitherto escaped my observation. My 
son led the way, and I followed. The stairs were 
steep, and much injured by time. I, with diffi- 
culty reached the top, when we entered a small 
apartment, the window and door of which were 
secured by an iron grating of massy strength, 
which appeared to me to have been newly con- 
structed. 

I had time for few remarks, for my unnatural 
son, ashamed to look me in the face, hastily quit- 
ted the prison he had destined for me, and having 
placed the strong bar on the outside, left the cas- 
tle to return no more. 

The truth soon flashed on my mind. My son, 
to enjoy my inheritance, had no doubt, reported 
me dead. Here, then, I was destined to linger 
out the remainder of my miserable existence. 
It were needless to dwell upon my suft'erings, my 


CLARA GA'IVL. 75 

despair, since my wretched child has gone to his 
long account.' 

" Is my brother dead then ? I enquired, in 
great agitation. My father sighed heavily, and 
brushed a tear from his furrowed cheek. 

" * Leandro is gone to his great account ; let 
us pray for the repose of his soul,* said my father ; 
after a long pause, he continued thus : 

" * My dismal solitude was not interrupted till 
noon, when Bianca entered my room with re- 
freshments, her features glowed with exultation* 
* Wretch! perjured wretch!' said she, * thank 
Heaven you are now my prisoner.* She appeared 
on the outside of the grating, where she placed 
my refreshments. Knowing her fiend-like cha- 
racter, and how long she had thirsted to be re- 
venged on me, my heart sickened at the sight of 
this woman, and I was silent. 

*' * You will be surprised, my child, to learn 
that Bianca was my affianced bride ; I loved her 
dearly. The day was fixed for our nuptials, 'vheii 


76 CLAUA GAZUL. 

a circumstance opened my eyes to the viciousness 
of her character, and I rejected her with scorn. 

" * In one year after the discovery of her un- 
worthy principles, I became the husband of your 
mother, and from that hour, Bianca hved but for 
revenge. She has twice attempted to destroy me, 
and contrived to escape. For many years I lost 
sight of her, but had reason to believe that she 
became the mistress of a most infamous character, 
and abandoned herself to such vices, as human 
nature shudders to think of. It was in the midst 
of her vicious career, no doubt, that my son met 
with her, and conceived she might serve his pur- 
pose. 

" * Forsaken by all the world, living only for 
vengeance, she accepted this trust with savage 
joy. Four years did I inhabit that wretched pri- 
son, during which time I never saw a human 
being, except Bianca, who brought me food and 
books, which were my only solace. One night 
some few weeks ago, when the air was still, and 
not a breath stirring, 1 thought I heard the dis- 


CLARA GAZUL. 77 

tant sound of music, I hastened to throw open 
my small lattice. The sounds, though distant, 
grew clearer — Was it a dream, or did I hear the 
hymn which I composed for my only daughter, 
my beloved Laura ? My heart thrilled once more 
with delight In a tremulous voice I tried to 
accompany the air. Suddenly all became still 
again, and silent as the grave. 

" * Tell me, Bianca,' said I to her the next 
morning as soon as she had made her appear- 
ance at the grate with my breakfast, * tell me I 
implore you, have I not heard the voice of my 
child?. 

" * Thy children shall live to be thy curse, 
false monster,' said Bianca. — * Thy daughter has 
become the victim of a lascivious priest, and 
she is pregnant. — Revenge ! I have thee in my 
grasp,' screamed out Bianca triumphantly, while 
her eyes glared on me with such a hideous ex- 
pression, that I turned from her in horror. 

** * A few days after I had heard the music. I 
was suddenly awakened by the appearance of 


78 CLAUA GAZUL. 

fire and smoke. Soon the flames mounted to my 
window. — Every instant threatened to crush me 
beneath the ruins of this mouldering castle. One 
side of the roof of my room fell in with a horrid 
crash. I resigned myself to a frightful death. 
The corner where my bed stood was still unin- 
jured.— The floor of my room began to scorch 
my feet, and I threw myself distractedly on the 
bed. In another instant, the floor fell in with 
me, and strange to say, I found myself in another 
apartment unhurt, except by the shock and a few 
slight bruises. 

** * The room I fell into did not appear to have 
been so much injured, and I contrived to open 
a door to the left, where I perceived only smoke ; 
the flames had gone out, or been extinguished. 

" * Some dismal ^groans now appalled my ear, 
I tottered towards the spot from whence they 
proceeded, and opened a door on the other side 
of the room. 

*' * Oh God ! How did I survive the awful 
scene that presented itself! Three mangled dis- 


CLARA GAZUL. 7^> 

figured human bodies, lay writhing in tortures 
clinging to a few remaining planks ! 

" * Water ! Water ! cried a voice, the accents 
of which still vibrates on my frightened senses. 

" * Let me hasten to conclude, I saw my son 
breathe his last amidst flames and tortures, the 
other two wretched beings, were Bianca, and he 
who was your affianced husband. 

*' * A hideous mass of bones and scorched 
flesh was shortly all that remained of the three 
miserable objects that perished in the flames. 
Near them stood a trembling ragged wretch who 
appeared to have escaped unhurt from the dread- 
ful conflagration, and to have been tendering his 
feeble assistance to the rest. On enquiry, I learn- 
ed that he was the village apothecary. 

" * Laura, you know the rest, I will not torture 
your poor bleeding heart by dwelling on the 
dreadful scene which this man has described 
to me, but frankly inform you that as soon 
as their shocking purpose had been effected, 
all three had drank large draughts of strong li-

quors, in order to drown remorse, and growing 
intoxicated, they threw themselves on the floor, 
and fell asleep. The fire that had been kindled 
for a dreadful purpose, being scattered far and 
■wide, had caught the dry wooden floor. 

" ' It was the poor apothecary, who saved your 
life, my child, at the risk of his own. You were 
insensible, and on account of the heat had been 
removed to a more distant apartment. He sat 
watching by your side, and when the flames burst 
forth, he carried you through the scorching 
apartments, and placed you in this wing of the 
building,^ which the fire has completely spared. 
He attempted afterwards to search for Bianca,and 
the other two hardened wretches, but before he 
could discover them, their bodies were nearly 
consumed by the flames. 

" ' After my son had breathed his last with 
his vile associates, the apothecary led me into the 
left wing of the castle, and throwing open the 
door of a large apartment, shewed me the form 
of mv beloved child ! 


CLARA GAZUL. 81 

" • Reclined on an old couch, as pale as death, 
I addressed you by the most endearing epithets 
of parental atl'ection, and pressed you to my 
heart. You appeared totally unmindful of my 
presence, your eyes were fixed — your cheek was 
chill and clammy. 

I dispatched the apothecary on various errands 
o procure you such comforts as you stood most 
immediately in need of. I know not how to do 
justice to the indefatigable zeal of this poor peni- 
tent man, by whose aid you were soon rendered 
comparatively comfortable. A decent village 
girl was procured to nurse you, a small tempo- 
rary kitchen, furnished with necessary utensils, 
to provide our meals ; good bedding, and almost 
all the comforts your melancholy situation re- 
quired, were soon procured by this indefatigable 
man, by means of some gold pieces which I hap- 
pened to have about me. The poor iellow, whose 
future wants I shall provide for, prescribed for 
you with skill, and your fever gradually abated.

I forgot to mention tlie circumstance, of 
having discovered among your papers, which had 
escaped the flames, a letter from your late wait- 
ing woman, containing her address at Naples. 

** * I procured an active youth from the next 
village to ride night and day in search of her. 
He returned accompanied by your favorite Fs- 
terre, in ten days. 

" * You were s>ill insensible. Your disorder for 
some time defied the skill of the most learned of 
the faculty, which we could procure from the 
adjoining towns. Your removal was pronounced 
dangerous until your disorder should turn. 

'' * I need not tell you what joy my heart felt 
when at length I heard you call me by the en 
dearing name of Father !' 

" Here," continued Laura, " ends my parent's 
account of himself. My reason being completely 
restored, it was my earnest wish to retire to a 
convent IVoni an idea that in such a seclusion 
I should enjoy more calm than elsew here. 

" Mv father procured every necessary for our 


journey, and by short sta:7es, accompanied by 
the poor apothecary, who had been furnished 
with means for a new equipment, we arrived at 
Naples, where he placed me under the care of 
the lady A bbess, and took a tender leave of me, 
but not until he had obtained my promise to live 
under his roof, and be mistress of his house, as 
soon as I should, in some measure, recover my 
serenity. In the mean time, my parent is occu- 
pied in arranging his embarassed affairs, which 
my brother had left in such disorder, that ruin 
must have ensued, had he not been so awfullv cut 
off by the very means which he himself employed 
for the perpetration of such a diabohcal and 
dreadful crime." 

Laura having concluded her melancholy story, 
was- so exhausted, as to be quite unable to utter 
a single word more, during the remainder of the 
eveni ng. 

Her health, however, gradually improved, and 
in a few weeks, she looked considerably more like 
her former self. 
I remained with her six weeks, and when I

left lier, she was in daily expectation of joining 
her parent, who languished for the society of his 
only child. 

Laura only once ventured to mention the Car- 
dinal during my residence at the convent. On 
that occasion she trembled violently, and could 
scarcely trust her voice to utter his name, for 
she still adored her seducer, while the conse- 
quences of her crime had been so appalling, that 
she considered herself as a wicUed wretch who 
could only atone for her past life, by devoting the 
remainder ot it to religion, and the performance 
of acts of charity. 

" Should I survive my only parent," said 
Laura, " to this convent will I return to lay my 
bones; — but I cannot forsake my lather. I will, 
therefore, devote my time to his poor tenants^and 
divide my fortune among the aged and the sick. 

J. pressed poor Laura in my arms, and bedewed 
her pale cheeks with my tears. — '* May we soon 
meet again, dear Clara," said she, ** something 
whispers to my heart, that n\ t shall be e're long. 


CLARA GA/UL. 85 

united lo part no more. Should the world ill- 
use you, and if you would enjoy the calm of re- 
ligious retirement, remember your poor unhappy 
friend Laura, who will receive you with open 
arms, and," continued Laura, blushing deeply, 
while taking a letter from her pocket book, " I 
have fixed my heart on having this letter deliver- 
ed to the Cardinal : I present it to you open, 
that you may first make yourself acquainted with 
the rectitude of my intentions.'* 

If I live, your letter shall be placed in the 
hands of your late guardian, Laura, said I, and 
now, may Heaven preserve you. 

Again and again we embraced each other, and 
but for the sound of the last bell for vespers, we 
had not parted even when we did, so much and 
tenderly had Laura's misfortimes, endeared her to 
me, and so warmly did she court my society. 

The Countess of Polignac having sent her 
carriage for me, I was no sooner seated in it, than 
I perused the letter intrusted to my charge for the 
Cardinal Poco-punmti, it ran thus: 


8{) CLARA GAZUL. 

" Anselm, 

"I write to bid you an eternal farewell on 
*• earth. — Bright as fairy dreams were once my 
" waking hopes. You were appointed the guar- 
'* dian of a child, and you betrayed your trust 

" I adored and respected you above all human 
" beings, and when your counsels might have led 
" me up to Heaven, by the sweet paths of virtuous 
** friendship, you preferred the indulgence of 
" your own appetites, at the risk of never end- 
** ing shame and remorse to me 

" Some indignation I have since encouraged 
** towards you, for that you have changed my 
* dreams of happiness to black despair; but my 
** heart would fain now be reconciled to you, 
*' Could you have but guessed the appalling fate 
** you were preparing for your wretched victim

The Countess of Polignac received me with 
much kindness, and shewed me a letter of her 
son's which had been received during my visit 
to the Convent, by a young college friend of his, 
who had handed it to his mother for perusal ; the 
letter ran thus : — 

*' My Dear Albert 

London. 

*' I was much vexed to learn, by your last let- 
" ter that you are disappointed in your wish to 
" join me in London. I should indeed have en- 
** joyed your society here above all things, if only 


CLARA GAZUL. J)l 

*• to keep me in countenance when I make blun- 
** ders. 

. '* The English, of all nations, are the greatest 
'• slaves to etiquette. They carry this weakness 
* to such an excess, that I assure you a bad tie of 
'* a neck cloth will be liable to get a man into dis- 
'* repute— nay almost cashiered from the fashiona- 
'* ble world, though he be the most learned, witty, 
" and agreable being alive. True, Birch, the mem- 
" ber of parliment, may tie his knot behind or un- 
" der his ear with impunity, but not so he who 
*• has his reputation to make in the world. 

" A quadrille must be danced in gloves, but a 
" lady's hand must not be pressed, unless du- 
** ring a caper, until the glove be removed ; and 
*• why it is rude to press a fair lady's hand in the 
" dance ungloved ;— -or why it is polite to unglove 
" when you press the same or any other lady's 
" hand even upon accidentally meeting in the 
" street, Heaven only knows ; but if you are not a

" single rap at a street door, instead of a repeti-

** every silly young man in the room : and again, 
*' at dinner, though you may be dying with thirst, 
** with a full bottle of excellent wine standing 
*' idle at your elbow, 'tis treason to touch it, un-

** precisely at the same instant, after making two

** at her eldest son last, for two glasses of wine, but 
" I had no sooner poured out the second, and

" under these restraints, but the youths from col- 
'* lege look as if they dared not swallow their food 
" freely, lest it should fall noisily into the sto-

** usually bored until some of them fell asleep. 
*' Having, at length nodded away some of the va- 
" pours of the wine, they arose in confusion, 
" and accompanied my Lord Raby to the draw- 
" ing room. There, the delicious fragrance of the 
'* tea, invited us to partake of that popular beve-

'* bass, while the former beat time or rolled his 
*' eyes in rapture over the music book ; after 
" which, they sang a duet together, making the 
" oddest faces you can conceive, which is the 
'* fashion in England. But the distorted muscles

" every body must melt in Jul}'. 

*' Apropos, I will take the liberty of describing 
'* these two English inseparables for the benefit 
*• of our poor Italians, who have not the honour 
" of being acquainted with them. 

** Mr. Mediocrity is a fat juicy looking man, of 
" six feet in heigth, the very emblem of good hu- 
** mour, with florid cheeks, and plenty of straight 
" hair. Mr. Mediocrity, to take him all in all, is a 
" companionable good sort of person enough, only 
*' he wears pattens and makes love to every body ; 
** and then he will sing, which is all nonsense 
'* after forty years of age, unless a man's voice 
** will bear him out, and he can doit without mak- 
*' ing faces. At all events, if the grimace must 
" be made, let the grimacier present his distorted 
'* features to his music book or the ceiling, in or-

•* sly laughter; but your sentimental singer, and 
*• Mediocrity is one of these, forces the whole 
'* swing of his ugliness on your attention, by sing- 
' ' ing at yoli, as well as to you, and when he fixes 
•* his melting eyes on your face, there's nor stan- 
" ding the sort of thing. 

" Now to do Mr. Athesjm justice, he never pre- 
'• sumesto look his hearers in the face, while he 
" is chanting ; not enchanting — if he did, and 
" those hearers should be fc^*fe ladies, and any 
*' amongst them [lapptirPcrCur^ in the way that 
** ladies wish to be who love their Lords ♦ * * * 
*• * * * but you have read Vathek ; so to proceed, 
** Athesim is a neat little man, with a large 
•' mouth. ' 

*• He possesses superior talents, and the worst 
** temper in all F.ngland. No matter, he is a very 
" honorable honest gentleman, but his grimaces in

CLARA GAZUL. (>7 

" methcxHstically caricatured, or more like Nep- 
" tune's trumpeter, Triton, as he is represented in 
•* the waters at Versailles. 

•' One would really imagine that Mr. Athesim 
** had been wound up for exhibition by a key, 
** which had set the mechanism a going for a gi- 
*• ven period, making it spout bass sounds that 
" rushed out of his cavern of a mouth like a roar-

" Villers to me. Her Ladyship is a fine woman of 
" at least forty years of age. 

" I had some idea of it, 1 replied, but was dis- 
" appointed at not finding Lord Ricketty at Lord 
" Raby's, who was to have accompanied me. 

** Her ladyship proposed setting nie down at

" handing her down stairs. 

" Lord Dolittle took charge of her companion, 
** the honorable Miss Would-be-woo'd, and we 
*• all four were shortly afterwards seated in her 
*' ladyship's box. 

" Miss Would-be-woo*d inspired me with pity. 
" Tall, bony, old, and ugly, yet glowing, as I 
" guessed, with amorous fire, and love to spare for 
" whoever might desire her favors. I fear she 
** had no chance of ever indulging her wishes; 
** for who would -venture to call down the ven- 
" geance of a noble family by dishonouring the 
** Honorable Miss Would-be-woo'd. 

" Grown bold from desperation, Miss Would- 
** be-woo'd chatters, frisks, and flirts, or lan-

** As a lad, I would have undertaken the dam- 
" sel myself had I met her at Naples, but I have 
'* no idea of being called to account for what

** would deserve certainly, and vanity apart, some 
" thanks at least. 

" Lady Rose is the most insipid woman on the 
** faccf of the earth, and can talk of nothing but 
" Almacks, and Lord Xodwell. I was delight- 
" ed to make my escape from her tiresome so- 
•* ciety. 

" The first acquaintance I met in the pit was 
" Lord Ricketty, who was discoursing with Lord 
" Parliamentary, a pragmatical, but rather clever 
" young man, who tolerated the Catholics, be- 
** cause liberality is the fashion. 

" Freedom of conscience is a great matter, and 
" it is not enough that the Catholics should hug 
" themselves with the delicious prospect of Para- 
** dise to come, while they confine us poor Prote- 
** stants to the lower regions for ever, but they, 
"must have places, forsooth! — and instead of 
" taking up the cross, and casting away all earth- 
** ly ambition, like St. Paul and St Peter, the 
" English Protestants must bring them into par- 
** liament, and thus give them a chance of send- 


100 GLARA GAZXJL. 

" ing the Protestants to the devil before their 
** time. For liberality gentlemen and ladies liberty 
•* of conscience means, that all Catholics may 
" damn us Protestants as much as they please, and

** Orator O'Rioter will shew you the act, such is 
" fair play! O'Rioter says so — nay, he will swear 
•' it. 

" Lord Ricketty held out his hand to me, and 
" presented me to Lord Parliamentary, who having 
** probably heard that I was a good boy at school, 
" and learned my book, took particular notice of 
•• me, and seemed anxious to discover by cross 
*• questions, to which he received the most un- 
*• satisfactory answers, whether I should disgrace 
*• my reputation. 

'* I was not in the humour for serious conversa- 
" tion, and the enlivening opera was not the place 
•• to render me so. 

** ' Lord Parliamentary, is desirous of admiring 
" your talents, which he knows how to appre-

" to some future opportunity tor enabling me 
** in my turn, to admire the talents of his 
** Lordship. 

** • I suspect that is a sort of hit at me,* said 
** Lord Parliamentary, with arch good humour, 
** for he was no fool to be touchy on such trifling 
** occasions. This urbanity made me suspect 
** that I was wrong, 

" I am afraid, said I, that either Lord Raby's 
** wine or Lady Rose Viller's conversation, or 
" both united, have been too powerful for my 
** youth and inexperience, and that I am grown

" natu redly, and he then condescended to enter 
" into conversation with me. 

*' He spoke of the debates he had himself

" If you were not Mr. Birch, I would venture

•• by no means the most learned. 

" I was master of every subject that was care-

" Mr. Birch, instead of making me speeches,

' '* ' You think me a very stiff straight-laced

" When my Lord, or from whence? I asked.

THE COUNTESS POLTGNAC JOINS HER SON IN ENG- 
LAND 1 ENTER THE FAMILY OF THE MARQUIS DE 

ST. BETISE. 

Soon after the receipt of this letter, the Coun- 
tess of Polignac, who almost adored her son, 
formed the resolution of joining him in England 
in the character of his aunt She kindly invited 
me to accompany her, which I declined, for se- 
veral reasons ; and I, at length, accepted the pres- 
sing invitation of the lovely Marchesa St. B^tise, 
after taking an affectionate leave of the Countess. 

The Marquis St. B^tise, was so overjoyed at 
seeing me arrived with my guitar, that he could 

not eat his dinner. 

Vol. II. B 


12'2 CLAllA GAZUL. 

*' The Signora Gazul will honour me with her 
opinion of my new opera," said he, " the first 
representation takes place in a few months. A 11 
the great singers are engaged ; all Naples will 
be there and Tantini takes the first part ! !" Saying 
these last words, the Marquis could hardly con- 
tain his rapture. 

The Marchesa was reclined on the sofa and ap- 
peared in very delicate health ; she was pleased 
to express her satisfaction, and great joy at hav- 
ing me for a companion. 

i\fter dinner, in the course of conversation, I 
happened to mention the young Prince Orazio, 
who had performed Telemachus. I soon dis- 
covered that this was a forbidden subject, by the 
deep blush that overspread the Marchesa's cheek, 
and the hurried manner in which her husband 
answered for his lady. 

The noble Palace of St. Betise, was full of visi- 
tors, and the Marchesa, made me many apologies 
for the necessity she w^as under of lodging me for 
a few days only with one of her women in a large 


CLARA GAZL'L. 123 

double bedded room — " She was your fellow tra- 
veller, however, said her Ladyship, and therefore 
may be less disagreable to you than a stranger." 

Our evening passed oft", I thought pleasantly, 
with the aid of some excellent music, and at a late 
hour I retired, with Fanchette, the little bold re- 
passeuse, who my readers may recollect was my 
fellow traveller from Lyons to Naples. 

*• Mademoiselle, your most obedient, said Fan- 
chette, how happy I am to meet with you again," 

I asked her how she liked her place ? 

** Oh Signora, said she," there has been rare 
doings here since we last met ; you must have seen 
that my lady fell over head and ears in love with 
the young Prince Orazio, on the night of her 
grand masquerade; — Every body saw how things 
were from the beginning, except the good husband, 
who gave his Highness a general invitation to the 
Palace. Oh ! to see how my lady would hang on 
his words, and watch his every movement. 

She is two years older than the Prince, and 
much slyer, still I am inclined to think she was 


l24 CLARA GAZUL. 

virtuous up to the time she saw him and for seve- 
ral months afterwards, thanks to the timidity of 
her very youthful lover. But she was caught at 
last, by her hushand, in some equivocal situation 
I guess, for the Prince was suddenly dismissed, 
and each servant threatened with being imme- 
diately discharged, if they ever admitted him into 
the Palace again. 

" The Marchesa has never held up her head since 
and has become as careless and indifferent about 
her dress as she used to be troublesome and fasti- 
dious. Instead of trying on a dozen caps before 
she could decide which would best suit her com- 
plexion, she naw leaves the whole business of her 
toilette to me, and sits sighing with her eyes fixed 
on vacancy while I fix her bright jewels, in her 
beautiful hair." 

And what has become of the Prince? I asked. 

'* Oh I he went to every party where the Mar- 
chesa was invited, and so haunted and tormented 
the Marquis, that for the last week he has con- 
fined his lady to tlie house, refuses to leave her 


CLARA (;azul. 125 

for a moment, even to attend to the most pressing 
business, and what is worse than all, he has 
caught his old aunt Donna Diablo, in the very 
fact of conveying a letter from the Prince to his 
wife, and now declares she shall never again enter 
the Palace." 

Is the Marquis really fond of his wife I I enqui- 
red. 

" Some doubt that," answered Fanchette, and, 
she continued, " it is a positive fact that he intri- 
gues with every maid servant in the house, who 
will permit him ; but he is proud of seeing his 
wife admired, and more magnificently dressed 
than any other lady in Naples." 

The Marquis is very unpopular, and passes for 
something of a coward, besides being vain, purse 
proud, and a fool, but for my part, I have found 
him a good master; — the truth of it is, he hu- 
fliours all my caprices, because I am the best small 
plaiter of shirts he ever met with in his life ; and 
next to Tantini, his Lordship loves dress. I have 


12(3 CLARA GAZUL. 

three hundred embroidered cambric shirts under 
my care." 

I remarked that the Marquis appeared to me to 
be a very well bred man. 

" You are right," said Fanchette, '* but he is an 
ass whom nobody cares to know, and many say 
his new Opera which he expects is to immortalize 
his name, will be damned upon the very first re- 
presentation. The Cardinal Poco-puranti too who 
is all powerful in Naples, from his immense 
riches, has taken a dislike to him. His Eminence 
regulates the Police, and most things temporal as 
well as spiritual in this city." 

Is he not the uncle of the Lady St. B6tise ? I 
asked, 

" Yes" replied Fanchette, " her own father's 
brother and he loves her with true and pure regard. 
She is, in fact, the only person for whom he is 
supposed to feel real affection. — By the bye, what 
a sad story is told of poor Miss Laura, whom his 
Eminence is suspected of having seduced. How- 


CLARA CJAZUL. 12? 

ever mum ! it is a ticklish subject to speak scan- 
dal of this proud and powerful prelate ; but you 
are sleepy Miss Clara and I must wish you plea- 
sant dreams." 

Good night Fanchette, said I, and we both 
soon fell asleep

THE SUMMER HOUSE. 


I BREAKFASTED with the Marchcsa by her own 
particular invitation, but the Marquis was pre- 
sent ; he was her very shadow, attending her 
even to her bath and dressing room. 

She was like many of our Spanish ladies, a 
very helpless creature. Her little feet seemed as 
if they were never meant to walk upon, and she 
had no more idea of putting, on her own clothes, 
than if she had been deprived of her hands. — 
True, she could manage to touch a few chords on 
the guitar to assist her song, but love alone could 
have made her an actress. 

At this time, the Marchesa was about nineteen 


CU.AKA (JAZUL. I09 

years of age, but from her infantine manners, she 
would have been guessed younger. There was 
much dignity in her shy reserve, and although na- 
turally artful, yet was she religious in her way, 
and both feared and respected her confessor. 

Under the semblance of genuine innocence, or 
high bred apathy, she possessed desperate passions, 
for the indulgence of which she had courage also 
to risk even her existence. But the Marchesa, 
now mourned in secret penitence, her dereliction 
from virtue ; yet the charm had proved irresisti- 
ble and now that she was deprived of her lover, 
life became a blank. 

I often read in the Marchesa's expressive eyes, 
her impatient desire to accomplish a t^te-a-t^te 
with me, but for more than a week the thing was 
absolutely impossible. Perhaps I ought to have 
left as soon as T had reason to suspect the sort of 
confidence which she was inclined to place in 
me. 

Alas ! I have many other faults to answer for, 
and I may here in extenuation plead the deep in- 

V^;l. 11. 


13<) CLARA (; A/U I.. 

lerest I felt towards this beautiful lady, also that 
her palace was the only respectable home that 
was now offered me. True, I had money, thanks 
to the kindness of Ligonia, and might have joined 
my nurse Agnes at Dieppe, but I had never travel- 
led alone, and to a Spanish girl such a project 
was truly formidable. 

I might also have obtained a safe and honorable 
asylum in the convent of St Lorenza, but I had no 
predilection for the monotony of a convent, since 
Laura had left it and gone to join her aged par- 
rent. 

In short, right or wrong, my inclination prompt- 
ed me to remain where I was. 

Spite of his zeal for watching his wife, the 
Marquis de St. Betise's health at length required 
that he should take exercise, and as his better 
half declaring herself too unwell to accompany 
him, he was obliged to leave her in charge of her 
own honor, after laying the strictest injunctions 
on his porter to admit no one in his absence. 

As soon as the entrance gate had closed upon 


CLARA GAZL'L. 


131 


the Marquis, his lady invited me to her closet, 
when with many deep blushes, and in the most 
painful confusion, caused more by her natural 
pride, than innate virtue; she told me " a round 
unvarnished tale," of, how she adored the young 
Prince, how vainly she had struggled against her 
passion ; when^ where, and how his Highness 
obtained the first kiss of love she had ever in her 
life bestowed on man; the second, the third, and 
so on progressively. 

How did the beautiful Marchesa's eyes kindle 
with the fire of that passion which was consum- 
ing her, and which she so feelingly described. — 
" Clara," she continued, " take pity on me and be 
my friend ; I am a wicked wretch, who have been 
false to my marriage vow. To you, and you 
alone, I have confessed so much— married at four- 
teen to the Marquis, whom I never loved, my 
virtue has been too weak to resist the extraordi- 
nary attractions of that dear Prince, for whom I 
would die a thousand deaths — Clara, I must — I 
will ice Orazio, once more. 


132 CLAKA UAZUL. 

Impossible, my dear Marchesa, for Heaven 
sake do not think of it : consider the dreadful 
consequences that may ensue ; certain death to 
him whom you profess to adore, for surely the 
Marquis would stab your lover to the heart if he 
were to make another discovery. 

" We would both prefer immediate death to 
living for ever separate," said the Marchesa, while 
her lovely cheeks were bathed in tears. She 
drew from her bosom a letter from the Prince, 
which her convenient woman, Fanchette, had 
just delivered to her : and at her request, I read 
as follows : 

** Leonora, 

*' Your beloved Orazio, implores you on his 
" knees. Do not condemn him to selfdestruc- 
" tion. 

" Let us renew these dear and delicious mo- 
*• ments of perfect happiness, where your head 
" has rested on my bosom, your heart has beat 
** against mine, and you have, iu thrilling accents 


CLAliA GAZL'L. 133 

" of love, sworn to be mine only, and for ever 
" mine — A nd you are gone from me Leonora ! 
'* Your angel countenance shall beam on me no 
*• more. 

"(Jh! how sad is my heart. — I feel myself 
" withering in the very morn of life, consumed by 
** fever — I shall die, cruel Leonora, my passion 
*' is destroying me. 

" I am very ill— nightly do I wander round 
•* the dwelling where my love sleeps calmly ; 
*• but no, no, she cannot rest, when her love is 
'* a prey to black despair. 

" I humbly thank you for all your tender let- 
*' ters, but Leonora, your next must tell me when 
" and where we shall meet. 

** Did you seek the love of a boy of sixteen, but 
" for his destruction? And can you leave me.^ 

** By Heavens, if I thought so * * * * but 
••no! I will for your sake curb the hatred I 
** bear towards your persecutor, your cowanl- 
" ly * * * * 

** Forgive me Leonora, 1 know not what I say. 


134 CLAHA UAZVL. 

*' Where, and when? In mercy tell me, lest 
'• I go distracted. 

" Orazio." 

Have you answered this letter ? 1 asked, after 
perusing it. 

** Yes," said the Marchesa, blushing, and in the 
deepest confusion, *' I have promised to be in the 
small summer house, which you know, is about 
half a mile hence, to-morrow evening as soon as it 
is dark." 

And the Marquis ! 

'* He, 1 know, must be absent, on urgent busi- 
ness— Clara, will you accompany me ? 

Tis hard to refuse you, but I dare not, nay, I 
will not. 

•* Then I have no friend on earth," said the 
poor infatuated iNlarchesa, bursting into tears, 
and sobbing aloud. 

IVly dear Marchesa, I am but a weak and 
voung adviser, but fain would I deter you from 
a project so dangerous: consider how unaccus- 


LLRA GAzrr,. 135 

tomed are ladies of our nation to wander alone. 
What will, what must your domestics think and 
say among themselves? What, if the Marquis 
was to arrive ? His road lies past that very sum- 
mer house ! You will then endanger the lives 
of your husband and lover, for a moment's gra- 
tification. 

** I'll hear no more," said the Marchesa, in a 
passion, stamping her little foot, and holding her 
ears. " I want no sermon from you, Clara — 
Betray me if you will, I'll meet Orazio if I can ; 
I'll run all and every risk, but I know you will 
not betray me." 

Dear Marchesa I 

" No more," interrupted the Lady, ** I was 
mistaken in you, let the subject rest ; favor me, 
if you please, with a little music, handing me her 
guitar. And glad enough was I to change the 
current of her thoughts, since I saw that all pray- 
ers, such as I had wit to make, would not alter 
her fixed resolve. 

The Marquis left his palace in his state car- 


13() (LAKA GAZUr.. 

riagc, early on the following evening, on a visit, 
as he affirmed, to one of the Royal Family by ap- 
pointment; the Marchesa then invited me to her 
dressing room : she was violently agitated. 

Fanchettewas employed in arranging her beau- 
tiful hair. Her Ladyship found many faults; 
examined herself in the glass, eagerly asking me 
if she did not look very pale ; would wear a cap, 
then snatch it from her head in disgust, and pre- 
ferred her hat and feathers, then her cap again. 

" Mais qu'avez vous Madame la Marquise?*" 
said Fanchette, in a pet. 

The report of a gun was heard at some dis- 
tance. 

'J'he Marchesa let fall a beautiful small round 
looking glass which she held in her hand. The 
palpitation of her heart was visible through her 
stays. 

*' 'Tis an ill omen, Madame la Marquise," 

* What is the niatter mv La'ly Marchioness, — Ed. 


CLARA GAZUL. 137 

Fanchette remarked, whilst picking up the bro- 
ken glass. 

** No, No, 1 will not believe it," said the 
Marchesa, and her smile was radiant with hap- 
piness. 

How brilliant was her beautiful Spanish coun- 
tenance, at that moment ! 

" I prefer the blue cap after all," said she, 
"Quick! Quick! Fanchette, hastily throwing 
off the one that had just been placed upon her 
head ; and in her eagerness she dragged out the 
large comb that fastened her profusion of hair, 
which now fell loose and long below her waist. 

'* Mais quelle manie*! exclaimed Fanchette, par 
exemple! It will take half an hour to settle all 
that hair again. Surely, Madame, the Marchesa 
must be mad to night. 

The Marchesa put her two pretty little hands 
together in the attitude of beseeching, " Fan- 
chette, ma bonne fille, rangez moi cela vite, mais 

' W hnt foJlv. 

Vol. II. T 


138 CLAKA GAZUL. 

au plus vite et tiens^vois tu-cette jolie robe ? c'est 
pour toi mon amie." * 

Fanchette thus encouraged, set about doing 
her best, Mais en grace done tenez tranquille 
votre petite t^te un instant ma belle dame,'*t said 
the abigail. 

In another five minutes Fanchette was dis- 
missed, and the Marchesa wrapped in her large 
Indian shawl, went out at the little lattice gate, 
which led to the summer house, that was built on 
the top of a steep hill. 

Whilst I was musing on the danger to which 
this lovely but guilty woman thus exposed her- 
self, Fanchette tapped me on the shoulder, and 
whispered in my ear, " She is gone to meet the 
Prince." 


* Fanchette ! My good girl ! Do all that hair up for me quick — as 
quick as you possibly can, and here — Do yon see this pretty dress ? 
It is for you my friend. 

In mercy then, my beautiful Lady, hold your little head still for 
one niomeiit. 


CLARA uAZUL. 13JJ 

Are you sure of that? 1 enquired. 

" Quite," replied Fanchette, adding, " It is too 
laughable to think of the pride of the Marchesa, 
seeing that I am her only friend. Yet, although 
I carry on their correspondence with the assis- 
tance of Old Diablo her aunt, she is not frank 
enough to acknowledge her faults and she trusts 
me only when she can't help it. 

" I would have accompanied the poor little 
woman, whose feet have scarcely ever pressed the 
ground; I would have protected her; — How is 
she to find her way this dark night ? you heard 
that gun go off, Mademoiselle, it was fired by the 
Prince to announce his arrival to his mistress. If 
the Marquis catches them together, he will 
surely murder them both." 

Heavens forbid, I exclaimed, and now I began 
to reproach myself for having refused to accom- 
pany this poor deluded young woman. 

What am I, I reasoned, that I should presume 
to act the prude ? — What should I have been bu 
for the noble generosity of my lover r 


140 CLARA GAZUL. 

Ever the creature of impulse, I flew up stairs 
for my hat and cloak j and hastily bent my tremb- 
ling steps towards the summer house. 

I was approaching very near it when I heard 
hasty foot steps close behind me. Turning my 
head, I saw by the light of the moon, which w^as 
just emerging from a thick cloud, the tall dark 
plume which adorned the hat of one of Prince 
Orazio's Chasseurs. 

'* Where can Mademoiselle be wandering so 
late?*' he asked civilly. 

I was in great confusion. 

The Chasseur observed to me that a slorm was 
gathering, and advised me to lose no time in re- 
turning. Before I could reply, the sound of hor- 
ses hoofs were distinctly heard. 

'* Mon Prince voici le iVJarquis," bawled out 
the Chasseur, in great trepidation, running towards 
the summer house. 

The door was speedily opened, the M^irchesa 
threw her arms about her lover's neck, " I^et us 
die together," said she. 


CLARA (jAZUL. 141 

Tlie young Prince eagerly searched for his 
dagger. 

" Prince,'* said the Chasseur, " remain where 
you are, the Marquis will scarcely visit the sum- 
mer house to-night. 

** Yes, yes ! he comes on purpose, else, why is 
he on horse back, instead of journeying down the 
straight path in his carriage,'* exclaimed the Mar- 
chesa. 

Not an instant was to be lost, only one path 
led to the house; the storm was rising — The 
Marchesa, who scarcely knew how to walk, could 
not possibly have got home in time, and then the 
rain fell in torrents. The disorder of her dripping 
garments must, therefore, have betrayed her. 

** Hasten onwards," said I, quick! quick! "and 
1 will detain the Marquis, — Hide! hide, for an in- 
stant for he comes,*' I continued in a whisper, 
and in another minute, I had taken possesion of the 
summer house The Marquis tapped loudly at the 
door, with his riding whip.— Breath le^ss with con- 
fusion. I made no answer. 


142 CLAiJA (iAZUL. 

At length, his Lordship, with a tremendous 
kick, had forced the lock, and I stood like a guilty 
thing before him. 

*' Mademoiselle Gazul 1 1 How came you here? 
Is it possible that you would condescend to ac- 
company the ." 

My Lord, said I, with a desperate effort of self- 
command, I am at your mercy, I came here to 
meet my lover, who is a Spaniard — He has dis- 
appointed me — You see me humbled to the dust 
and truly penitent. You are a man of honor, I 
have my livelihood to earn by my own industry 
and I am very young. Take pity on my youth 
my Lord. 

•* Oh la pauvre jolie petite Clara! "* said the 
Marquis, who appeared charmed with this ren- 
contre. 

" And I thought you so severe!— but do not 
agitate yourself, rely on my honor. Sit down ma 
belle demoiselle, t and let us await the storm — 

» Oh ? the poor pretty little Clara ! f M\' sweet lady. — Ld.

" I would be revenged on the spot — Oh ! the

Excuse me, my Lord, the subject is too pain- 
ful— too humiliating. 

*' Then let us change it, lovely Clara, — but re- 
member my discretion must be one day reward-

Indeed, my Lord, I cannot guess, said I, in 
much trepidation. 

** Figurez vous Mademoiselle que je suis fidele

" Ah ! mais tres, tres fidele!— C'est que voyez

" Oh que les femmes sont bizarres! et ja

face with his delicate glove." 

And is jealousy confined to our sex, my Lord? 
I asked, making an effort to .prolong our interview, 
in order to give the Marchioness time to escape. 

•* C'est a dire que nous sommes tous jaloux de 
temps en temps *' J rejoined the Marquis." 

At this moment, we heard heavy foot steps ap- 
proaching. 

Hush ! hush ! Be silent as death " said the Mar- 
quis, in a whisper, and then hastily left the sum- 
mer house shutting the door after him. 


* All ! indeed vfei-y, very constanl. — But you must know my child 

that my Lady Marchioness has very delicate health and then 

you have seen the liltlc milk girl.

J: That is to say we are all of ns jealous at one time or another.

1 heard the voice of a female on the outside of 
the door; she must have worn wooden shoes, 
judging from the noise of her foot steps. 

'* Ah ! Marquis, I fear I am too late," said she, 
my good papa was in the humour to relate long 
stories, and I feared he would never have retired 
to rest." 

" You are, indeed too late, my pretty child- 
hush ! my servant is there ; you cannot enter ! 
He followed me to bring a challenge!— for this 
very night !!— Judge then if at so critical a mo- 
ment, I can be sensible of your favors. This piece

" Good night xMarquis !" 

" Adieu ma belle laiti^re '— One little kiss,"— 
and now the wooden shoes sounded a retreat 

" I am a sad roue," said the Marquis to me, on 

his return— " but you could fix my heart!—

Monsieur le Marquis je suis bien coupable, J 
said I, and then asked pardon for having pre- 
sumed to make use of the Marchesa's lamp.

Lordship, "but where did you find it?" 

Where did I find it? My Lord!— why I

Is the Marchesa retired to rest? I enquired and 
was answered in the affirmative.

RECEIVE NKWS FROM MADEMOISELLE ST. SAUVEUR 
— WHO IS ENAMOURED OF A NOBLE COUNT — ANEC- 
DOTES OF THE MARQUIS ST. BETISE. 


I DID not see the Marchesa till late the next 
morning, when she appeared exhausted and truly 
unhappy. 

In a few days more, the Marquis grew tired of 
keeping his wife at home, and insisted on her at- 
tending all the routs and parties, to which she 
was daily invited — I usually accompanied her 
ladyship, and we met the young Prince Orazio 
every where. His Highness was somewhat chan- 
ged in appearance, since I had first seen him ; he 
was italler and paler, had a slight cough, and ap- 
peared consumptive, but his beauty, if less bril- 
liant, was infinitely more touching. 


m- 


CLARA GAZUL. 151 

How he would sit and gaze on his mistress 
whom he was not permitted to address! How 
soft were her glances when directed towards him. 

The Marquis was a pacific man by nature ; he 
flew in a passion one night, nevertheless, at the 
Cardinal Poco-puranti's concert. 

" Impertinent young coxcomb was his audible 
exclamation, uttered between his close teeth as 
we stood watching the young Prince. The fire of 
indignation flashed from the bright eyes of the 
youthful Orazio, but he had sworn to his belov- 
ed to give the poor Marquis, carte blanche, to 
a certain extent, and he curbed his rising passion 
and changed the fiery expression of his anger to 
that of contempt. The Marquis ordered his car- 
riage, and we all three drove home in perfect si- 
lence. I could not envy the matrimonial tete-k-t^te 
■which I knew awaited this unhappy pair. 

The next morning after 1 had quitted the 
breakfast room, there was a regular scene ; some 
of the household actually affirmed, that the Mar- 
quis struck his wife, but this I doubt. The man 


152 CLARA OAZUL. 

was soft and civil by nature, and his wife was so 
fragile! However, he was sorely provoked, and 
there was much sobbing and hysterics on the 
part of the distressed Marchesa. 

At length, the Cardinal, her uncle, was sent for, 
who reproached his lovely niece with such seve- 
rity, that she fell intoa sort of fit, when the fright- 
ened Marquis sent for Doctor Pastoral. 

Doctor Pastoral declared that the fit was pro- 
duced by the Marchesa's high wrought sensibili- 
tes, acting on her nervous system which was deli- 
cate as the web of a spider. That her Ladyship 
must console herself for these little accidents with 
the reflection, that the more delicate the nerves, 
the more exquisite the feelings, &c &c. Thus en- 
couraged, her Ladyship had a second fit. 
The Cardinal became now so alarmed as actually 
to advise the Marquis to allow his poor sick niece 

to see her lover once more in his presence The 

Marquis was absolutely beside himself, for these 
fits, were not altogether make believe. The Mar- 
chesa's health and nerves were much disordered. 


CLARA GAZUL. 153 

that is the truth of it, and when she had got into 
a fit, she could not recover so soon a's she might 
wish. At length the Doctor was dismissed, and 
the Cardinal spoke to her so eloquently against 
the crime of incontinence, that the Marchesa sent 
for her confessor, and to the joy, of her tender 
spouse, promised to be guided by his spiritual ad- 
vice. 

After this hurricane, there was a dead calm, and 
no more quarrelling between the noble pair for 
more than a month. If, during that month the 
lovers contrived to correspond, they certainly 
never accomplished a meeting. 

About this time, I received several letters; one 
from the Lady Polignac dated London full of 
friendly professions. She described her dear son 
Eugenio, as being very happy in England, and in- 
formed me that he had undesignedly made a con- 
quest of a beautiful young Lady, the only daugh- 
ter of a nobleman of much talent ; was the favo- 
rite of the great Mr. Birch, and admired by every 

one.

iMy second letter came t'roiii Mademoiselle St. 
Sauveur, wlio was still residing vvith the relative 
of Doctor Lambert. Her health, she informed me 
was perfectly restored, and she gave me to under- 
stand that she had fallen in love with a young no- 
ble Neapolitan, who visited at the house, which 
was situated in the most lovely romantic retire- 
ment, in a rich country, some thirty leagues from 
Naples. Her friend, Madame Lambert, she des- 
cribed as a very rich fantastical old woman, who 
still at fifty and upwards, hoped to pass for young, 
by the help of cosmetics and every art that could 

possibly be imagined Part of Mademoiselle's 

letter ran thus ; 

" My friend, Madame Lambert, is kind to me, 
" but I am anxious to consult my dear Clara, and 
" to learn her candid opinion of my noble lover. 
** Our first meeting was truly romantic. 

" I lost my way in the large forest, which is 
" situated only two miles from our residence. As 
" night approached, I became dreadfully alarm- 


CLAKA GAZUL. 15.9 

" ed ; suddenly hearing footsteps close behind 
" me, I fainted ; and on my recovery, found my- 
** self in a small hut reclined on a mat. A no- 
*' ble looking young man, richly dressed, stood 
** watching my countenance, with an appearance 
" of tender interest. 

Where am I ? I eagerly enquired. 

" * Fear nothing, he replied, you see me anxious 
" to obey your commands. I am the Count Al- 
" berto, by birth, a Neapolitan, on a visit to the 
" Duke of Almeida's, who resides in this neigh- 
*' hourhood, and wandered this evening about 
" the forest, in search of my dog Mameluke. Will 
*' you give me an opportunity of being serviceable 
** to you .?" 

*• Encouraged by his gentle tones, I explained 
" to him who I was, and implored him to con- 
** duct me home. He was most happy, he said 
*' in the prospect of being of service to me; in 
" short, he protected me in safety to Madame 
** Lambert's who fell n\ love with him at first 
'* sight, and during three months that tht- Count 


15(i CLAJtA GAZUL. 

** Alberto has been our daily visitor, the good 
** lady has not remarked that he paid me any 
** court; but on the contrary, she believes that he 

«* returns her foolish passion for him," much 

more did Mademoiselle St. Sauveur write, and 
her letter concluded with earnest entreaties that 
I would visit her.' 

After the receipt of this letter, I began to think 
that, since my advice might really be of use to this 
young lady, in her present unprotected situation, 
it would perhaps be unkind to refuse to visit her. 

Still I felt a repugnance to the idea, for I 

could not forget the inveterate hate she had shewn 
towards Ligonia, not only while labouring under 
a dreadful malady but also since her recovery had 
been completed. 
. I determined to defer answering Mademoiselle 
St. Sauveur's letter until I had endeavoured to 
reason away my prejudices. 

My third letter was from Agnes, dated Dieppe. 
She wrote in good spirits. Albert, her husband. 


CLARA GAZUL. 157 

was still kind. Her little shop answered well, 
and they enjoyed all the comforts of life accor- 
ding, to her humble notions. 

The Marquis St. Betise gave the most elegant 
dinners in Naples, and for less than half the ex- 
pence that was lavished on the groaning tables of 
the great Cardinal Poco-puranti. His Lordship 
was an excellent economist, and regulated the ex- 
pences of his household with exact frugality. 

His man cook, in a clean white apron each 
night at a given hour, entered the study of the 
Marquis, and placed the bill of his dinner expen- 
ces on his Lordship*s desk, at which hour his 
Lordship never failed to attend, for the purpose 
of examining the said accounts, and affixing, if cor- 
rect, his, " rubrique apostillee." The cook might 
then present it to the steward for payment In 
like manner, was the said artiste's bill of fare 
placed every morning at an early hour on his 
Lordship's table, with the market prices of provi- 
sions in general, when his Lordship would write 
opposite the chose.i articles the words *' pour 


158 CLARA GAZUL. 

deux," " pour dix," " pour cinq,"* &c. &c. ac- 
cording to his notions of sufficiency, and his judg- 
ment and taste in these important matters were 
perfect. There was seldom a dish to spare at his 
table, and yet there was always what was most cal- 
culated to excite the appetite, and to encourage it : 
all was piquant, delicate, and recherche. 

In short, had the good Marquis*s taste in music 
been equal to his judgment in the art of domestic 
comfort, joined with economy', he would not have 
been banished from the land of his forefathers, by 
order of his Holiness the Pope. But I must not 
anticipate.

A HUSBAND DUPED — A CUNNING PRINCE — AN IMPAS- 
SIONED MISTRESS GROWN DESPERATE. 

" Oh! la jolie petite Espagnole qui demande 
apr^s vous,"* said the Marquis St B^tise one mor- 
ning to me. I was surprised. His Lordship in 
answer to my enquiries informed me that he had 
met the Lady at the grand entrance and heard 
her enquire for Mademoiselle Clara Gazul alledg- 
ing that she brought her a letter from some of her 
relations at Madrid. 

I almost dreaded to hear from my unfortunate 
mother, whom it was not in my power to love 
or respect. Pity for her vices was the mildest 
feelings I could encourage towards such a parent, 

*0h! the pretty littk Spanish girl who is asking after you.— Ed. 


160 CLARA GAZUL. 

and therefore, as long as she continued in afflu- 
ence, I desired to be forgotten by her. I could 
not, however, avoid speaking to the young lady 
who had called on me. 

On entering the small reception room, into 
which she had been politely invited by the elegant 
Marquis, a very tall young lady, w^hose face was 
covered with a thick black veil, made me a low, 
but rather awkward curtesy. Her dress was 
strictly Spanish, yet she spoke to me in French. 
She appeared in great confusion, and made me 
many unintelligible apologies, for intruding, plea- 
ding unfortunate circumstances, unlucky stars, 
miserable privations. &c. &c. 

I took out my purse — Can I offer you any relief 
Mademoiselle? said I — The young lady shook 
her head, and appeared to suppress a laugh with 
difficulty. I begged her pardon for the mistake I 
had made, and entreated to know her motive for 
favoring me with a visit. 

" Guess, said the Lady throwing aside her veil. 
I was puzzled : — Somewhere I had seen such 


CLARA GAZUL. 1(>1 

fteatures, but could not call to my recollection 
where or when — " I doubt really Mademoiselle 
our having ever met— and — yet — but it cannot 
be — surely you cannot be the. 

** I am that unlucky fellow, the Prince Ora- 
zio," said his Highness, throwing himself on his 
knees 

** You will not surely have the cruelty to be- 
tray me Mademoiselle, you do not desire my 
death." 

Prince, said I, with some indignation, I feel my- 
self really insulted — I was proceeding, when the 
door opened, and the Marchesa having fastened 
it after her, flew into the arms of her lover. And 
now my sermons or lectures on decency, honor, 
&c. might as well have been murmured to the 
wind, or to empty space for any good effect they 
would have on the enraptured lovers, who seem- 
ed almost expiring with joy. So finding myself 
a mere cypher, in this trio, I was withdrawing, 
and had laid hold of the handle of the door, when 

the Marchesa suddenly recollecting her very cri- 
VoL. II. y 


1^ CLARA GAZUL 

tical situation, seized my hand and implored me 
to invite the Prince into my own bed room. 

Lady Marchesa, I am really astonished at the 
boldnes of your request. 

•* But we are desperate," said her Ladyship, 
and she now led the way towards my bed- room 
followed by the Prince. 

Madam, 1 will not — I cannot, said I ,as we pas- 
sed along the corridor — here I paused, for at that 
moment we came in contact with the Marquis de 
St. B6tise, who was running all over the palace, 
looking for his wife. 

" Ou vas tu ma petite *?" said his Lordship to 
his wife, who spoke very little Italian. 

" Mademoiselle Gazul was too ceremonious to 
venture to invite her friend, who requires repose 
to her own private room,*' answered the Marchesa, 
and therefore 

Mon Dieu mais pourquoi non ?t" interrupted 
the Marquis. 

* Where are you going to, Dearest 

t Heavens !— But, Why not. 


CLARA GA2UL. 163 

Monsieur le Marquis, c'est que - - - ♦. here I 
paused — Could I betray the lovers, and thus, per- 
haps, be the cause of their death ? beheving as I 
did that the Marquis would not scruple to bury 
his dagger in the breast of the Prince — Impossi- 
ble., 
I fear — I fear— was all I could articulate. 
C*est moi qui aura Thoneur de conduire votre 
belle amief, said the gallant Marquis, and thus re- 
lieving my embarassment, he offered the Prince 
his arm with a graceful bow. 

It was with awe and maiden-like trepidation 
that the amorous young Prince, ventured to lean 
on the Marquis, who having conducted her along 
the corridors to my little boudoir, presumed at 
parting, to press his lips on his Highness' s fair 
hand. 

And now that we are alone Prince, said I, 
after the Marquis had retired with his lady, and 


* Mjr Lord Marquis— The fact is* ■ ■ 

t I shall myself have the honor of conducting your fair friend. 


164 CLARA GAZUL» 

closed the door on us, I must frankly inform 
your Highness that you have taken an unwarrant- 
able liberty with me. The Prince acknowleged 
hie fault, and while he stood trembling and im- 
ploring my pity, Fancbette shewed her head at 
the door, and beckoned me to follow her. I 
obeyed. 

"The Marchesa desires to speak to you in the 
drawing room, directly," said she. 

On entering, I found her ladyship examining 
some music, with her husband — " Clara," said she, 
•* this opera is so beautiful, that I wish you 
would sing the songs in it. I have been telling 
the Marquis that you have already studied them; 
and Fanchette has just informed us, that your 
Spanish friend wishes to take a nap, after the fa- 
tigue of her journey " 

Really your Ladyship is too 

" Mademoiselle Clara," interrupted the Mar- 
quis, " I am charmed to hear that you admire my 
new opera, and have done me the honor to study 
my best songs, I am all impatience," and he 


CLARA GAZUL. 1(53 

handed me my guitar, and opened the music- 
book. 

My Lord, I must really be excused, I real- 

ly 

Oh ! que vous ^tes cruelle, mais mon Dieu Ma- 
demoiselle vous savez combien j'amie la musique» 
et vous me refusez! — Ordinairemei]t vous 6tes si, 
complaisante *!'' 

To be brief, his Lordship would take no excuse 
and whilst I was accompanying my guitar, her 
cunning Ladyship glided out of the room, and 
went to join her lover unperceived by the enthu- 
siastic Marquis, who was beating time to his own 
melodies, with all the energy of his soul. 

Our music lasted an hour, at the end of which 
period, the Marchesa returned to us. 

" II est p^rti" — whispered her Ladyship in my 
ear. 

* Oh ! How cruel you are ! But ray fair Lady 300 know how 
passionately I love music, and you refuse to sing — generdUy too yoa 
are so very obliging.

ALBERTO —IS HE A BANDIT ? 


The next morning I told the Marchesa, that it was 
my intention to leave her, — She burst into tears, 
and at length obtained my unwilling promise, 
to remain with her just as long, and no longer 
than her conduct should be free from reproach. 

She was in great affliction, her dear Prince was 
dying. The fever of jealousy and passion was 
consuming him. He had caught cold on the 
night they had met in the summer house by re- 
turning home in the storm, and his cough was in- 
creasing. *' In short," said the Marchesa, '* we 


CLARA GAV.VL 16? 

shall soon be in our graves, if we continue se- 
parate." 

I said what I could to comfort her, and endea- 
voured to open her eyes as to the weakness and 
wickedness she was guilty of. She listened to me 
this time with patience, and seemed to wish to ac- 
quire a command over her headstrong passions. 

** If Orazio was happy I could endure any sa- 
crifice," said she, and then intreated me to talk to 
him. I could scarcely avoid smiling at the idea of 
my becoming the monitor of the young amorous 
Prince. We were interrupted by Fanchette, who 
carried it with a high hand at the Palace St. B^- 
tise, and excited no small degree of jealousy 
among the household, by the influence she had 
obtained, as a sort of factotum in various branches 
and departments. 

She was prima donna in ihe laundry, and the 
Marquis would almost as easily have submitted to 
part with his second best fiddle as have been 
deprived of her, excellent small plaiting of his 
shirts; — and then the poor guilty Marchesa was 


\6S CLAIJA GAZUL. 

in her power, and, therefore forced to humour 
her. However, injustice to Fanchette, 1 must ob- 
serve, that the girl, though an intrignante, was not 
quite a monster, and she really did feel something 
like attachment for her helpless mistress; >vhich 
said feeling she had evinced with warmth and 
energy in those moments when she believed the 
Marchesa's life was in danger from the violence 
of a justly offended husband, who had been heard 
to say, that he would stab his rival to the heart, 
if he should find him again in his wife's society, an 
act not very unfrequeut in Italy, under the like 
provocations. 

" Why ladies you will not be dressed for din- 
ner," said Fanchette, *' and dont you know that 
the handsome and mysterious Count Alberto dines 
here to day ?— He is to be presented by the Car- 
dinal Poco-puranti.— Every body is dying to see 
him for he seldom remains at Naples for more 
than a fortnight during the whole year, andean 
i-arely be prevailed on to go to parties. The few 
ladies, however, who have met him, have so tur-

ned the heads of the rest, by their description, 
that not a Signora in Naples, married or single, 
who would not be ready to travel to Rome to get 
a sight of him." 

" I have not the least curiosity," said the Mar- 
chesa, sighing languidly. 

Is not Alberto the name of the celebrated chief 
of Banditti that justice has so long and vainly 
been seeking for ? I asked. 

" The name to the very letter," said Fanchette, 
*' and what is more mysterious still a Lady (Signora 
Lorenza,) whose carriage was attacked some two 
years ago by a party in masks, declares that the 
person of one of the robbers, was strikingly beau- 
tiful, and reminded her of the Count Alberto, 
who is to dine with the Marquis to day." 

So he is of ancient family ? I enquired, while 
Fanchette was assisting the Marchcsa to dress. 

" Oh yes, his patent of nobility has been closely 
inspected, his credentials are clear and satisfactory, 
and he is really and truly the last and only de-

170 C LARA r.AZUL. 

scendent of the noble family of Alberto, a family 
famed for their high courage and feats in arms." 

What are the mysterious features of his charac- 
ter ? I asked, and was informed that some few 
years back Alberto, somehow or other, became 
an object of suspicion to government. 

Fanchette knew not exactly why; probably 
his frequent and continued absence from the place 
of his birth ; the rich jewels he wore, whilst it was 
known that his estates were mortgaged to the last 
shilling, might have excited some curiosity, at 
least, enough to have led to further investigation, 
at a moment when Alberto the robber was sought 
for with such diligent activity as scarcely ever 
did lazy Italian police exert on any former occa- 
sion. 

To proceed, opportunities are easily discovered 
or fabricated in Italy, to arrest an individual who 
has become the object of vague suspicion to the 
government, but however that might be, Count Al- 
berto had been confined several months, when af- 
ter the closest and most scrutinous investigation, 


CLARA GAZUL. 171 

no proofs to liis prejudice had been made, and he 
was of course acquitted. 

It was in the course of this investigation that his 
patent of nobility had been examined, and proved 
genuine. Many noblemen of high rank came from 
Rome and Florence as witnesses for the Count. 
AH these alledged that they had met him at vari- 
ous courts in Germany, Spain, and other countries, 
and that every where they had seen him receive 
the respect that his talents and high rank had a 
right to demand. With regard to the costly jew- 
els he wore, these were probably presents from 
some of the many Potentates and royal Person- 
ages who delighted to honour him. 

He was a first rate poet, and in Germany, 
had obtained great celebrity for a poem entitled 
* Robbers and Soldiers,' This poem contained 
much keen satire, but of that refined and close na- 
ture which did not amount to a libel on the army 
although it savoured of it. 

We listened so attentively to Fanchette*s inter- 
resting account of the handsome Count A Iberto, 


172 CLARA GAZUL. 

that we were nearly too late for dinner, as the 
company only awaited our presence to sit down 
to table. 

Glancing my eyes around me they were soon at- 
tracted by the very striking person of the Count, 
who sat on the left of the Cardinal Poco-puranti. 
He was a man nearly six feet in height, and very 
graceful as to the exact proportion of his strong 
muscular limbs. His eyes were black, bright, and 
piercing. Their expression denoted vast energy, 
and strong passions. There was no malice lurking 
in his smile, which was very beautiful, from its 
strong contrast with his usual haughty cast of 
countenance, and the display it aiTorded of his 
brilliant teeth. His round full lips vied with the 
purest coral. His nose and forehead were formed 
in the exact contour of Grecian beauty, his skin 
dark olive. Then his hair was very remarkable, 
so black and glossy, hanging about his ears in 
large decided natural ringlets so unlike the coif- 
fure of any other man at table, that it would have 
been deemed coxcombical, but for the manly tout- 


CLARA GAZUL. 173 

ensemble which counteracted its etVect. Indeed, 
the unstudied attitudes, and whole bearing of the 
Count made one fancy these beautiful ringlets but 
the unsophisticated growth of his head, and be- 
longing to that peculiar style of countenance 
which could not have dispensed with its rich lux- 
uriance without absolute disfigurement. His 
chest was high and deep. A very lion in strength 
and agility as he appeared befor.e us in the prime 
and strength of manhood, it had been, a bold ene- 
my that had dared to venture his single arm 
against that of Alberto. 

I was never more surprised in my life than on 
being informed some time afterwards that this 
hero was in his thirty fourth year, as no one could 
possibly have guessed him older than six and 
twenty. True, there were visible on his forehead 
some few lines, but these appeared to be the efiect 
of thought or cares stamped by strong passions 
on his brow, and not by age; and the curve about 
his mouth had such a character in it, that it 
must have been always there. He wore no whis- 
ker on his transparent olive cheek, but a profuse 


174 CLARA GAZUL. 

moustache graced his mouth, as bright and black 
and curling as the ringlets of his head. 

His dress was rich, but plain, and instead of 
covering his person with pretty gems, like the 
Marquis St. B^tise, he wore few, in number, but 
these were so costly and magnificent that each 
and every one separately would have realized a 
fortune to the owner. A Turquoise, the largest and 
finest in all Italy, fastened his dark velvet cloak, 
and the brilliant that adorned his finger, had been 
often valued at ten thousand Rosines ;* his watch 
and snuff box were also set in large diamonds, 
and the hilt of the small rapier he usually wore 
about his person, was studded with rubies of rare 
beauty. It struck me that, an artist who was re- 
quired to paint a chief of Italian banditti in all the 
glowing beauty that his fancy could image, and 
most in unison with his subject, would have pain- 
ted Alberto. 

Oh strange that with this style of beauty he 
should also bear the name of that terrible chief of 

* A Tuscan coin value about sixteen or seventeen shi/iings.— Ed. 


CLRA. GAZUL. 175 

robbers who had SO long infested the Appenines 
and all Italy. Yet did not these strange coinci- 
dences, on reflection, carry with them conviction 
of the Count's innocence ? Would the true rob- 
ber, whose life had long hung by so slender a 
thread, boldly shew himself at every court 
with the style and bearing and real name of the 
bandit ? Would he have published a poem, the 
subject of which was robbers? 

In short, I felt, almost convinced that no possi- 
ble ground for suspicion rested on the noble look- 
ing Count Alberto, w ho could be no other than 
Mademoiselle St. Sauveur's new lover as descri- 
bed in her letter. 

I forgot to mention a story which had got wind 
among the domestics, namely, that the Cardinal 
had received some secret instructions from his 
Holiness, the Pope, advice rather, to court the 
acquaintance of the Count Alberto, and keep an 
eye on him, now that he believed himself entirely 
freed from all further surveillance. However 
that might be, the Count's manner of addressing 


176 CLARA GAZUL. 

his discourse to the Cardinal, was certainly frank, 
friendly, and fearless, while that of his Emi- 
nence towards the Count, was ceremonious from 
excess of far-fetched politeness. 

" Cardinal," said the Count, 1 forget on what 
occasion *' ('ardinal you are too ceremonious for 
me even when most at your ease ; I beseech you 
therefore, not to go out of your way on my ac- 
count. I am a soldier, rude in speech and man- 
ner, compared to your infinite suavity, which 
does but sharhe me. 

** You have served then,'* said the Cardinal, 
disregarding the Count's accusation. 

" Aye Cardinal I am an old soldier— too old 
perhaps for your taste," 

" I have not, I confess, the honour to under- 
stand your meaning Count," the Cardinal obser- 
ved. 

" Why, we cannot serve God and Mammon ; 
Is it not so written in your book, good Cardi- 
nal r 

" We are not met here as mere book-worms. 


CLARA GAZUL. 177 

but ill the true spirit of free and friendly inter- 
course," said his Eminence, " therefore, permit 
me to offer you wine, and they touched glasses, 
after which the conversation took a more general 
turn. 

There was a large party invited to pass the 
evening with the Marchesa,and dancing as well as 
cards was introduced. The Count, tall as he was 
struck me as the best waltzer in the room. He 
danced with so much spirit and grace, that it was 
really inspiring, and matrons of all ages were by 
him persuaded once more to exhibit on the " light 
fantastic toe," even the Marchesa St. B^tise, much 
as she adored - the charming young Prince, could 
not help admiring the lively amiable temper of 
the handsome Alberto. As for the Marquis, he 
declared the Count's feet, in the dance, went as 
true to the music, as its echo. 

" Enfin," said his lordship, holding his opera 
glass to his eye, "c'est admirable !" As for the 
young ladies^ who crowded the saloons of the 
Marchesa, their questions made to each other en

passant, that night were not, according to their 
usual form, of eloquent address—" How do you 
do,'* but, " Have you danced with the Count? — 
Do you think he will waltz with me," &c. &c. 

** Mais quelle infame police,*" exclaimed the 
Marquis St. B6tise, who was more French than 
Italian, " Can one fancy any thing more grotesque, 
absurd, and outr6, than the idea of their having 
sent to prison one of the most amiable noblemen in 
the world." The Marquis purposely uttered this 
sentence which was addressed to me, so as to be 
overheard by the Count, as he approached us for 
an instant, while in the act of waltzing gaily with 
the Marchesa, who growing giddy at that mo- 
ment, the Count led her to her husband, and bow- 
ed his grateful thanks for the compliment. 

" Count Alberto," said the Marquis, ** I hope 
we shall often see you at this palace, and allow 
me to assure you, that we shall feel disappointed 

* What an infanjous polke. 


CLARA GAZUL. 1 79 

if we do not." The Count promised to profit by 
his politeness during his short visit to Naples. 

" You were just now complaining of the stu- 
pidity of our police, if I heard you right," said 
the Cardinal Poco-puranti, who was reclined on 
a canape immediately behind us. 

" The worst organised in all Europe, " said 
Alberto. 

" I am afraid you are right," observed the Car- 
dinal. 

"At all events, the Count may reasonably be 
disgusted with our laws, since they have subject- 
ed him to months of unmerited imprisonment," 
the Marquis observed. 

*• Let us hold in mind." said the Cardinal fix- 
ing his eyes on the Count, '* let us hold in mind 
that Alberto the bandit, is a very desperate villain, 
and when we consider how long justice has been 
trifled with, she may, perhaps, be pardoned, should 
she at length be forced to do a little wrong in the 
hope and belief of being one day enabled to 
bring many a dark deed to light, the culprit to an 


180 CLARA GAZUL. 

ignominious death, and thereby a great and over- 
balancing good. 

" I have really nothing to complain of," said 
the Count, unaft'ectedly, " for I am an odd person, 
who travel all over the world, with a large bril- 
liant on my finger, and a dagger beset with ru- 
bies." 

" Voyons done ce petit poignard !" said the 
Marquis ; *' en grace Monsieur le Comte montrez 
nous ce poignard en rubis dont, on m'a tant 
parle.*" 

Alberto as he drew the dagger from his breast 
smiled on the Marquis, and the smile said, as plain 
as it could speak,—" Poor civil ass/' 

The dagger was handed by the Marquis all 
round the room, but not till he had himself ad- 
mired it rapturously for several minutes. 

" Oh the lovely little dagger!— The delightful 
brilliancy of these rubies!— they are perfect, and 
in such profusion," exclaimed the ladies. 

* Let us see this little dagger !— Pray Count show us thia ruby 
mounted dagger which I have so rauch heard of. 


CLARA GAZL'L ISl 

When the dagger was at length handed over to 
the Cardinal, which was not until the females 
were all quite tired of it, his Eminence set about 
examining it so very minutely, that one would 
have said he was counting the rubies, and noting 
the size and quality of each. The Count, as soon 
as he had observed what the Cardinal was about, 
burst into a laugh, which seemed to be, or was 
the eft'ect and indulgence of spontaneous merri- 
ment. 

*• Are you laughing at me Count?" said the 
Cardinal, laughing also, for he was a man of the 
world, and knew how to conform to the fashion 
or whim of almost any society. 

** His Eminence," answered the Count, " re- 
minds one, that is to say, he appears to me to be 
taking an inventory of my poor rubies, in order 
to effect an execution." 

The Cardinal was no fool, — He felt that the 
Count had read his thoughts, and the discovery 
caused him some confusion. The office of a spy 
must ever be attended with risk and some chance 


18*2 CLARA GAZUL. 

of humiliation, even when the cause is a good one. 
Mucli as the Cardinal, no doubt desired to see the 
bandit secured, partly from good will towards 
the state, but chiefly and more particularly on 
account of his own large property, which was 
spread far and wide, and which had been and 
might he still more injured by A Iberto^s desperate 
band ; yet, so far from feeling any bitterness 
against the Count individually, or any wish to 
find him a depraved character, he would, I really 
believe have felt shocked, as far as a cold man can 
be shocked on such ocasions, had he seen just 
cause to suspect the gay, and apparently frank 
and noble Count of such vices, as human nature 
recoils from. As his suspicions faded away, he, 
perhaps, rejoiced, that they did so; while, as a 
gentleman, he began to feel almost ashamed of 
his late doubts, and the duty which had been im- 
posed on him by his Holiness the Pope. 

" I owe you no ill will personally, upon my ho- 
nour," said the Cardinal, with unusual frankness, 
returning the dagger. 


CLARA GAZUL. 183 

" And why should you?" the Count asked 
good naturedly, " but that you take me to be the 
robber Alberto." 

Oh! quelle affreuse idee,*" exclaimed the Mar- 
quis St. B^tise. 

" How very ridiculous! ! What a fancy !" said 
the ladies, all speaking and laughing together. 

The Cardinal was a gentleman, and perfect can- 
dour wag now the only chance a gentleman had 
of getting out of such a scrape. 

It is my duty and ray wish to ascertain, if pos- 
sible, and beyond all possibility of doubt, that 
your Lordship is not the bandit," said the Cardi- 
nal in a loud hurried voice, as though his cou- 
rage, had been screwed to the emergency with 
some difficulty. 

" Par exemple, c'est un poco trop fort," said 
the Marquis who was apt to mix up French with 
Italian in moments of unusual irritation. 

"Not at all Marquis," A Iberto replied, I am 

' What a shucking idea. 


184 CLARA GAZUL. 

sorry, truly sorry, that you see it in that light: — 
The Cardinal, vour noble relative, is doing his 
duty/' 

" I will have no inquisitorial investigations un- 
der my roof,"— said the Marquis " etje declare 
moi, que son Eminence prend trop sur lui — enfin 
je declare ici que le Cardinal Poco-puranti m'a in- 
sults ce soir,**' — here the litttle Marquis struck 
the table forcibly with his hand. 

The Cardinal reddened, but fearful of compro- 
mising his dignity, answered nothing to the Mar- 
quis, and merely desired a page, as he passed, to 
order his equipage 

*' Beautiful and noble lady,*' said Alberto, ea- 
gerly addressino^ the Marchesa St. Betise, " I have 
a boon to ask — your uncle loves you, make up this 
foolish matter. 

" Willingly will I strive to do so" said her

Ladyship, and then she joined the Cardinal, who 
was taking hasty strides about the room. 

** My dear Marquis/' said Alberto, in answer to 
his elegant host who was apologizing, professing, 
protesting, &c. &c. backed and encouraged by 
all the ladies in the room, " my dear Marquis, 
wherever I go I shall remember your hospitality 
towards a stranger with gratitude, for the inten- 
tion, which must have been kind :— But allow me 
to add, that had your Lordship but consulted your 
own excellent understanding, and you are a very 
sensible man. 

" Oh monsieur le Comte," said the Marquis 
bowing, and pressing his hand to his heart. 

** Had you my noble host, 1 say consulted your 

judgment it would have told you that the person 

who bears the name of a terrible robber, dresses 

after the fashion of a bandit, wears costly jewels 

without stating whether they may be the gifts of

the Marquis interrupted. — " defies restraint of all

the world, writes poetry about banditties, mortga- 
ges his noble patrimony, and hates a priest ;— such 
a man, I say can feel no surprize or objection to 
pass occasionally for the bandit Alberto." 

** Tout cela est tellement dramatique,*' said the 
Marquis, " que je vous jure que j'en ferai un 
op6ra.*" 

*' Buffa ou serio,?t" enquired Alberto eagerly. 

** Mais, Monsieur le Comte c'est que mon fort

"Diable! Vous allez me pendre done ? quelle 
sombre imagination ! §" said Alberto with comic 
gravity of expression. 

" Le voila de belle humeur,ir* said the Mar- 
chesa dragging forward her uncle the Cardinal's 
hand, and placing it in that of her husband's, and

SO the peace was patched up between Poco-pu- 
ranti, and St. B^tise, although in their hearts they 
detested each other for fifty-one reasons; but 
chiefly the Marquis disliked his Eminence on ac- 
count of his great influence and power, and his 
love of meddling and exercising that power in all 
matters great and small, to an extent that on vari- 
ous occasions had interfered with what the little 
Marquis conceived to be his own prerogative; but 
enough of this dinner party. 

Alberto having taken his leave, all seemed " flat, 
stale, and unprofitable" to his fair admirers, who 
soon followed his example.

INDIGESTION — FRENCH AND ENGLISH MODE OF 
CURING IT. 


Amongst others who were invited to dine with 
the Marquis St. B^tise on the following day, was 
a certain Englishman, who was at that time on a 
visit to the English Ambassador. — I think he was 
called the Honorable George Mountain. 

This gentleman was enthusiastic in praise of 
the Marquis de St. B6tise's cook,— never even at 
the table of his Majesty of England had he eaten 
better soups; and, as for the fish, and the maca- 
roni!! in short, the honorable gentleman de- 
clared that a man might travel all over the conti- 
nent vainly searching for such another cook. 


CLARA GAZUL. 189 

" Mais vous etes infiniment trop poli *•> gj^^^^ 
the Marquis in reply. 

Now to show how transitory are all the enjoy- 
ments of this life, in the midst of the Englishman's 
eloquence, he was seized with an alarming fit of 
indigestion, attended with symptoms of infla- 
mation. — The Marquis, dispatched his chasseur 
for his favorite French Doctor, Monsieur Pastoral, 
and at the same moment, Mr. Mountain's valet ran 
oir to his Ambassador for their physician. — The 
gentleman of tlie faculty entered the room toge- 
ther, and exchanged formal bows. 

" Since you are both here, gentlemen, contrary 
to my intentions," observed the sufferer, '* pray 
consult together like friends and christians, and let 
us see what France and England can do for me." 

•* With all my heart," said tlie English Doctor, 
to the Frenchman, adding " there is only one little 
inconvenience, which is that, our English mode of 
treating disorders is the very reverse of yours." 

IP But you are infinitely too poii'c. 


190 CLARA GAZUL. 

** Cependant," replied the Frenchman, " we 
agree in the grand principle which regards the 
present case ; namely, that a disease of this nature 
which evidently arises from repletion, must be 
relieved by * * * *. 

" True, true," interrupted the Englishman, 
•* but then your mode of administering is the very 
reverse of ours." 

" Vous avez tort, a 9a ! il n'y a pas a*dire, vous 
avez assurfement tort,*" said the Frenchman, 

" C*est k savoir.t" observed the Englishman. 

" Cependant," retorted the Frenchman, " one 
of your English authors has partly observed that, 
as in all diseases nature being forced out of her 
seat must be replaced by means of treating the 
body in a manner directly contrary to custom,— 
that is to say, by interchanging the use of things. 

" Les Anglois n'en veulent pas,{" interrupted

the Englishman, ashamed of the dirtiness of the 
argument, although myself and the Marchesa had 
retired, to a distant window, and he knew not that 
we overheard their discourse. — " I should advise 
copious bleeding, added the Englishman," after 
feeling the patient's pulse. 

** Non pas!" said the Frenchman, ** non pas ! 
mauvaise habitude— cependant," after touching, 
the pulse, " je ne m'opposerai point k Tapplication 
de quelques sangsues, puisque le malade a beau- 
coup de fi6vre.*" 

" I have no time for your leeches, so stick your 
lancet into my arm at once," exclaimed the Hon* 
rable George Mountain, in a feeble voice. 

" Why not apply the remedy to the part affec- 
ted ?" said the Frenchman. 

** Blood taken away in such small quantities is 
of little or no use," observed the Englishman. 

** You will destroy the system," retorted the 
French Doctor. 

* Not at all — no — a bad practice, I shall nevertheless not object 
to the application of a few leeclie;-, as the patient has much fever. 


192 CLARA GAZUL. 

"And I," said the Englishman, '' acquit your 
leeches of doing good or harm, generally speaking 
— What will two or three black worms effect on 
the system of a man of full habit like our pa-

" Et puis Ton donne des rafraichissements,*"

ed out with such freedom from the honorable 
gentleman's arm, that the Frenchman's face and 
shirt received a considerable sprinkling from the 
vital spring, " par exemple!" observed the 
Frenchman wiping his face, ** par exemple !

** I beg you ten thousand pardons," said the 
English Doctor politely. 

" II n'y a pas de quoi, II n'y a pas de quoi —

" Diable ! lis font les choses en grand ces mes-

The honorable George Mountain did not die 
nevertheless, but just the contrary — and he had 
the ingratitude to seduce away our cook because 
he found bleeding could so easily and effectually 
remove his indigestions. 

The Marquis de St. B6tise never forgave him.

THE CHALLENGE. 


The next time Count Alberto dined with the 
Marquis, he contrived to speak a few words to 
me in private, relative to Mademoiselle St. Sau- 
veur, and handed me a long letter, which she 
had commissioned him to deliver to me. 

This letter was full of Alberto, and to judge 
from the style of tenderness, in which he was 
mentioned. Mademoiselle St. Sauveur must 
have almost adored her handsome lover. The 
mysterious character and bearing of the Count, 
gave me some uneasiness, for I should have re- 
gretted that so interesting a young Lady should 
become the victim of a selfish unprincipled man. 


196 CLARA GAZUL. 

Hitherto, I was, however, rather disposed to 
think favorably of the Count, but I knew him to 
be still an object of suspicion to many individuals, 
and particularly to the Cardinal Poco-puranti. 

Whilst I was making up my mind about visit- 
ing Mademoiselle St. Sauveur, the Marquis one 
day ordered his carriage, and went to dine in the 
country. He had scarcely left the house, when 
I missed the Marchesa, who was absent for more 
than two hours. That she had not left the pa- 
lazzo, appeared evident ; Fanchette too, was ab- 
sent I met the Marchesa at dinner, but though 
we were t^te a t^te, and her eyes were swollen 
from weeping, she did not once touch upon the 
subject of her sorrow. c,.t* i. 

The Marquis returned early in the evening ; he 
made no remarks in my presence, on her altered 
appearance, but the next morning he set a

amused with the remarks and complaints 1 heard 
from all quarters. — Char-women, washer-women, 
with baskets on their heads, confectioners, butch- 
ers, &c. all returning from whence they came af- 
ter thumping and peste-ing at various back doors, 
which had up to this day been appropriated for 
their private entrance into the palace, tag rag and 
bob tail must now all pass by the grand entrance, 
and tread with their filthy shoes or sabots the no- 
ble hall of polished marble. 

" What in the name of all the saints can this 
mean?" ejaculated the head cook, perspiring with 
agitation, " I can't get into the pantry ; the mac- 
aroni will be spoiled — the scullions will be an 
hour taking their rounds from the offices by the 
grand entrance — and death and the devil. — Here is 
my ice house blocked up with mortar !" 

In the midst of this confusion, Fanchelte 
beckoned me into her room. 

" Figurez-vous," said she, bursting with laugh- 
ter as soon as she had closed the door, *' Figurez- 
vous Mademoiselle que cet imbecile de Marquis

has shut up every door in the house but the right 
one." 

I endeavoured to frown — " A lions Mademoi- 
selle," she continued, '• you cannot help laughing 
out of the corner of your mouth after all."— She 
then described to me the small door by which the 
Prince had entered and passed along one of the 
cellars by a back wretched flight of stairs to the 
large dark garret where she kept her dirty lin- 
nen. Such a temple of love, so filthy and discon- 
solate could scarcely be imagined. 

" How the Marquis came to know of their 
meeting I cannot guess, since I do not believe 
there was a servant in the house bold enough or 
spiteful enough to have betrayed their mistress. 
Be that as it may, the fact I am about to relate 
may be depended upon, as I had it from good au- 
thority." 

" The Marquis de St. Betise having dispatched 
a polite note to the Count Alberto, requesting that 
noblemen to call upon him immediately, on an 
affair of life and death, Alberto was soon after

wards announced, and received by the Marquis in 
his library. The usual compliments having passed, 
the Marquis addressed the Count about in these 
words. 

" Mon cher Monsieur le Comte, permettez moi 
d*avoir Thonneur de vous annoncer pour commen- 
cement que je vous aime, et que je vous estime in- 
finiment.* 

" Upon my honor I know not for what. Mar- 
quis, and yet I thank you" — answered the Count 
frankly. 

•' To cut the matter short, noble Count, I want 
to fight a duel," observed the Marquis in hurried 
accents, while his colour changed from pale to red 
and red to pale. 

** I am truly concerned. Monsieur Le Marquis, 
cannot matters be made up V said the Count, as 
calmly, as though duelling was the most simple 
thing in the world. 

" Impossible Count," replied the Marquis, in a

paroxysm of rage— " impossible!— I must shoot 
the Prince Orazio! — je le tuerai ! ! Oh! ca c*est 
sur ; ma parole d'honneur je le tuerai! !* Here the 
little perfumed gentleman struck his hand on the 
table with violence. 

" Mais c'est toutsimple/'f said Alberto, calmly, 
being well acquainted with the provocation he had 
received. 

" Comment ? — Eh ! — II faut se battre ! — n'est ce 
pas r":J: ejaculated the Marquis eagerly, while his 
lips quivered, and grew pale. 

Alberto examined the Marquis with much cu- 
riosity; he knew he was a silly weak man, but he 
did not quite understand how any gentleman could 
live and breath without his fair quantum of de- 
cent courage for such great occasions, " mais 
qu'avez vous mon ami ?"§ he asked at length. 

" II faut se battre Eh?" said the Marquis. 

* I will kill him ! — Oh ! that is certain : — My word upon it I will 
kill him. 

t That is a matter of course. 

\ What?— Eh I— I must fight ? must T not ^

*' Ma foil Monsieur le Marquis cela depend 
de vous-meme,"* answered the Count. 

" Ainsi va le monde,"t said the Marquis in a 
pet. 

By this time it became clear to Alberto that 
the little perfumed Marquis had no courage to 
spare. 

'* What can I do to serve your" the Count 
asked, growing tired of this silly business. 

" I have to beg the favour of you to be my 
friend on this occasion, and to carry my chal- 
lenge to Prince Orazio," said the Marquis, rally- 
ing famously. 

"Bravo," said the Count Alberto, as though he 
would have encouraged heroic feats even of an 
infant 

** I leave it to the Prince to name time, place, 
and weapons," continued the Marquis stoutly, 
as soon as he had swallowed a glass of fleur d'or- 
ange. 

* Faith ! Marquis that depends upon yourself, 
t So wags the world.

"I will wait on his Highness immediately," said 
Alberto with polite urbanity, taking up his hat 
and quietly putting on his gloves. 

" Votre empressement est on ne pent plus 

poll"* observed the Marquis in a tone that savour- 
ed of reproach. " Vous me flattez,"t said Alberto, 
understanding him literally, and bowing he re- 
tired. 

'* Mais ! — mais ; attendez done — attendez un 
petit moment," J — said the Marquis, but he spoke 
too late to be heard. 

When the Count Alberto called upon the 
Prince Orazio, he was informed by his Highnesses 
valet that his master was too much indisposed to 
admit visitors. 

" Tell him I come from the Marquis de St. B6- 
tise, and will not detain him five minutes," said Al- 
berto, and the servant having spoken to his mas-

ter, returned to invite the Count to liis dressing- 
room. 

The gentlemen were slightly acquainted, from 
having met each other at several parties. The 
Prince was reclined on a sofa, and appeared so 
pale and weak, as to be unable to rise, although 
he made the attempt. Alberto requested he 
would not disturb himself, and in a few words 
explained his errand. Tlie Prince's eyes flashed 
fire, and his pale cheek was crimsoned for an 
instant. 

" I have so long desired this meeting," said he, 
" that your friend may rely on my punctuality." 

The hour, place, and weapons being agreed 
upon, Alberto took his leave. He found the 
Marquis surrounded by his parchments and 
papers of every description, consulting with his 
homme d'affaires. Calling his Lordship aside 
Alberto informed him that everything was set- 
tled, and that he would call for him at ten o'clock 
on the following morning. The Marquis thanked 
him, and appeared tolerably calm. 


204 CLAUA GAZUL 

" What sort of a swordsman are you Marquis?" 
enquired Alberto as soon as they were alone. 

" Why," said St. B^tise, " I learnt fencing five 
years when I was a little boy, and I have since 
fought a famous duel with a Spanish chief, which 
gained me some applause I assure you, though 
perhaps I ought not to say so much of my- 
self." 

" Tant mieux Marquis, you will now then be 
quite at home in this affair," the Count observed. 

" I hope so," said the Marquis, ** and yet there 
must be a wide difference between fighting really 
at the risk of one's life, and merely fencing grace- 
fully for effect in an opera." 

** In an opera! !" exclaimed the Count. 

" To be sure," answered the Marquis, " you 
seem amazed." 

" Have you never heard that I am fond of act- 
ing, as well as composing operas, and that I 
played Edward the Black Prince, to a crouded 
audience at my own private theatre some time 
ago?" 


CLARA GAZUI.. 205 

" Je vous en tais mes coniplimens," * said Alberto 
laughing outright. 

"Monsieur le Comte est si gai I !"t said the Mar- 
(juis,— " et moi je veux Tetre aussi. — Did you ever 
fight a duel, pray Count ?"

laughin£{.

" Le plus grand du nionde,"§ said Alberto. 

" Did you ever get drunk in your lite." en- 
quired the Marquis, who had swallowed t^vo 
glasses of garus, and whose nerves were now in 
a state of considerable excitement 


* i wish you joy of it.

" Et vous Monsieur le Marquis?"* Alberto en- 
quired, witliout answering the question. 

" Ma foi ! lion, jamais de la vie ; et comme il

" L'id^e est gaie,":{: answered Alberto with ani- 
mation. 

"Pour cela, oui !"§ — rejoined the marquis, ** and 
I have some of the most curious old wine in all 
Italy. The Cardinal himself cannot produce 
such wine, and he has acknowleged it. 

"Commenqons de suite," {{ said Alberto.

me by Alberto himself, whilst I was on a visit to 
Mademoiselle St. Sauveur. 

When the Marchesa and myself met the Count 
and Marquis at table, being then perfectly igno- 
rant of what was going on, the Marquis's flighty 
behaviour so astonished us that we really thought 
he had gone mad. We retired as soon as the 
cloth was removed, leaving the Count and Mar- 
quis t^te a t^te. They joined us in the Marche- 
sa's library to take their coffee, two hours after- 
wards, at which time the Marquis was evident- 
ly and decidedly intoxicated. 

The Marchesa shook her head at the Count 
and signified to him in a half whisper, that this 
was the first time the Marquis had so far forgot- 
ten himself. 

"Noble lady," replied Alberto, "we have 
drank glass for glass, but his Lordship has a weak 
head for wine, which I was not aware of." 
The Marquis staggered towards the canape where 
I was seated, and throwing himself on a large 


208 CLARA GAZUL. 

easy chair, began to pay me some absurd compli- 
ments in the midst of which he fell fast asleep. 

•* Your uncle, the Cardinal, takes me for a rob- 
ber, while you, gentle lady, are disposed to think 
me a drunkard," said the handsome Alberto to 
the Marchesa, seating himself by her side. 

*' Nay, I hope not, Count, replied the beautiful 
Marchesa, it were a pity that so 

'* So what? — proceed lovely Marchesa," inter- 
rupted Alberto, drawing nearer, and seizing her 
hand. 

The Marchesa's eyes flashed bright with indig- 
nation, as she withdrew it, and threw a hasty 
glance, on her husband, whose pale yellow face 
as he slept and snored, formed a hideous contrast 
with Alberto's glowing sensible countenance. 

" Ecoutez belie Marchesa," whispered the 
Count, upon whom the Marquis's excellent^ wine 
had produced at all events, some little effect, 
" je connois votre amant— II est beau, et brave — 
je me battrai pour vous si I'occasion se presente, 


CLARA GAZUL. 509 

mais de grace ne soyez pas cruelle — me me refu- 
sez point un petit baiser.* 

The Marciiesa led a dull miserable life, de- 
prived of her lover, and watched and tormented 
by her silly husband ;— the opportunity would 
probably never occur again. Half the women in 
Naples were dying for Alberto, who was seldom 
known to pay them much, or indeed any court, 
and Spanish Ladies possess warm temperaments. 

Alberto's beautiful lips quivered with pleasing 
expectation ; the opportunity was so piquante, 
the husband looked so ugly, and the Count so 
infinitely graceful. 

" A lions belle et charmante Marchesa, accor- 

dez moi un seul pauvre petit baiser me

the Marchesa'e rosy lips> but that he was an epi- 
cure and would owe all to her free will and 
choice. 

" Promise to ask no other favor,*' said the 
blushing lady, in a whisper. 

" Upon my honor," answered Alberto, laying 
his hand on his heart. 

The Marchesa ha^'ing thrown one more hasty 
glance on her husband, to ascertain that he slept, 
leant forwards, and their hps met. 

I was gliding out of the room;- — ** Do not 
leave us Mademoiselle Clara, I intreat you,' 
said the Marchesa, hastily jumping up and 
seizing my hand to detain me; I begged seri- 
ously to be allowed to withdraw. " Then we 
will retire together," said her ladyship. 

** Permit me to have the honor of wishing you 
both good night, and charming dreams," said 
Alberto bowing respectfully, and taking up his 
gloves. The Marchesa being thus reassured of 


CLARA GAZUL. 211 

his tact and respect, appeared almost to regret his 
departure. 

" Good night, Count Alberto, I hope we shall 
often see you," said her ladyship. 

The Count having expressed himself obliged 
and flattered by her invitation, took his departure.

CHAP. XXVI 


AN ITALIAN NOBLEMAN'S BOUDOIR — A DREAM. 


The next morning, at a very early hour, the 
Marchesa and myself were invited to breakfast 
with the Marquis in his drawing room, which 
said apartment, reminded one of the boudoir of a 
Parisian belle. His Lordship's dressing table 
contained every possible luxury for the toilette 
that could be imagined, and many that no man 
but himself ever thought of inventing. All was 
rich, costly, and magnificent. The draperies, 
curtains, &c. were composed of pale pink satin ; 
the whole of the ceiling was covered with looking 
glasses, also the walls, the large pier glasses being 


CLARA GAZUL. 213 

only separated by narrow pink satin flutings or 
draperies. 

There was a piano forte of curious workman- 
ship, in glass and ivory. Fiddles, guitars, flutes, 
and music books were scattered m every corner 
of the room ; the floor was covered with crim- 
son cloth, of the finest texture, adorned with a 
curious border wrought in gold embroidery. 
Bouquets of real lovely flowers ornamented many 
curious Dresden vases, while they emitted the 
most fragrant perfumes when they were not over- 
powered by the Marquis's otto of rose wash 
balls, &c. 

We found his Lordship reclined on his luxu- 
rious couch of down feathers which had a second 
loose cover of thick sea green silk thrown over it 
to protect the rich pink satin beneath. He wore 
a bright yellow dressing gown of Indian stufl", 
lined with white silk, slippers of ruby-coloured 
velvet, and a green satin night cap, which fell 
over one ear, ornamented with a gold tassel, and 
covered with a red silk net. His hair was in 


214 CLARA GAZUL. 

papillotes, couleur, bleu de ciel,* and one row 
visible under his night cap, which was bound 
about his temples with a small Indian Cashmere 
handkerchief of many colours. 

However graceful and rich this costume may 
seem in the description, his Lordship's choice of 
colours, was certainly unfortunate, with regard 
to his complexion, which, always sallow, never 
appeared to greater disadvantage than in his green 
cap and orange gown, reclined on his green cana- 
pe; and what with all this, and his temples being 
surrounded with blue satin paper papillotes, the 
little man reminded me of hobgoblins playing at 
snap-dragon. 

" Entrez ma petite,t--entrez Mademoiselle Cla- 
ra/' said his Lordship, when we tapped at his 
door. He spoke in a faint pitiful voice. The 
Marchesa enquired kindly after his health. 

" Malade ma petite bien malade,":{: said he, 

* Colour aetherial blue.

Alberto was announced at this moment, and 
I observed that the Marquis turned deadly pale. 
Understanding they had private busuiess to trans- 
act, the Marchesa and myself left them together, 
when, as I was afterwards informed by Alberto, 
the following dialogue took place : — 

Marquis. — ''Now we are alone my kind 
friend, I must lose no time in telling you that I 
have determined not to meet the Prince." 

Alberto. — '* Not meet him! ! you are joking 
Marquis." 

Marquis. — " Point du tout, I have passed the

into an immoderate fit of laughter; then taking 
up the affair in this merry mode, he added, •' I

glass. 

" Je bois ^votresant6,"§ said the Marquis, bow-

A DUEL. 

** What the duce can I say to Prince Orazio,** 
exclaimed Alberto, gaily, while snatching up his 
hat to depart. 

" You will, I know, be careful of my honor," 
answered the Marquis, "ainsi vous remarquerez si' I 
vous plaira en passant, que Cesar ne s'etoit jamais 
battu, en duel, n'importe comment il fut cocu."* 

" C'est 9a, said Alberto," kissing his hand to 
the Marquis, by way of salutation, as he hastily 
retired. 

It wanted twenty minutes to the appointed 
time of meeting on the ground, when the Count 
Alberto called on his friend the Duke of Almeida. 
His Grace was a fop of first rate notoriety, whose

fopperies were copied by half the Italian nobility 
in Naples. He was reclined on a sofa dictating a 
billet doux to his young secretary, who having 
retired, Alberto, in a few words, acquainted the 
Duke with the occasion he might possibly have 
for his services.'* 

" Oh ! dont fight," said his Grace, ** you are in- 
finitely too handsome for that kind of thing, be- 
sides it is going out of fashion in high life. What 
can you have to do with the silly Marquis's do- 
mestic affairs. 

" I have really no time to explain", answered the 
Count, hurrying his grace down stairs. 

'* But I am acting in the dark," retorted the 
Duke, as soon as they were both seated in Al- 
berto's princely equipage. 

Alberto had his own private reasons, no doubt, 
for the great reserve he maintained with his 
friend, and these reasons were best known to him- 
self. He might have felt loth to expose the paltry 
conduct of the weak Marquis, whose hospitality 
he had just been enjoying; or perhaps he wish- 
ed to befriend the husband in order to secure free 


•24 CLARA GAZUL. 

access to his beautiful wife. Or it is possible that 
he considered it altogether derogatory lo the cha- 
racter of a brave man to dwell unnecessarily on the 
subject of an affair of honour, in which he was 
likely to become a principal. 

Be that as it may, Alberto contrived to evade 
the scrutiny of the Duke. 

" There will probably be no fighting at all," 
said Alberto, " and if there should, the previous 
conversation, w'hich of necessity must take place, 
will put you au fait." In a few minutes they 
were set dowm at a short distance from the spot 
where the duel was to have been fought between 
the Prince Orazio, and the Marquis St. Betise. 
They were almost immediately joined by his 
Highness, who was accompanied by the Count 
Melendez. 

The young Prince's eyes wandered eagerly in 
search of the Marquis. 

The blush of shame tinged Alberto's cheek, as 
he stammered out the following apology :

fleeted on the on the scandal which which 

any quarrel with your Highness would draw 

down on the Lady St B^tise, declines that is 

to say, the Marquis commissions permits me, 

rather, to act for him in this business. 

" And do you call such a miserable reptile your 
friend, my Lord?" said tlie Prince contemptu- 
ously. 

" Are you disposed to become my father con- 
fessor Prince?" asked Alberto with much gentle- 
ness. 

" My friend is not here to answer any irrelevant 
question, that his Highness may choose to put to 
him," observed the Duke of Almeida, addressing 
the Count Melendez, " but if I understand the 
case rightly, the Count Alberto stands here in the 
place of the Marquis St. Betise, in case you are 
disposed to accept him as a substitute." 

'* My friend has no quarrel with the Count 
Alberto," replied Melendez, "but" he continued, 
.* we consider the Marquis as a cowardly contemp-

tible wretch, whose baseness we will pubhsh all 
over Italy." 

'* And you may tell your noble friend to be- 
ware of my cane the first time I come across 
him," said the Prince, in a violent passion. 

" I see, with regret," remarked the Duke of 
Almeida, *' that you will not be disappointed this 
morning, and since there is no remedy. Count 
Alberto, you had better take your ground." 

" But the prince is such an invalid," said Al- 
berto. '• 

" A paltry evasion," replied the Prince, whose 
temper had become morose and irritable by long 
suffering and disappointment. 

" Take your ground," said the Duke, a second 
time. 

** Are you a good swordsman," enquired Al- 
berto of the prince. 

'* Do you prefer pistols or swords ," said Count 
Melendez to Alberto," who replied that he was 
equally au fait to either. - 

No more time or words were wasted, they 


CLARA GAZUL. 227 

fought with admirable and equal skill, during the 
first five minutes — " Take breath," said Alberto, 
suddenly pausing, impelled by the impulse of the 
moment on observing the extreme debility of the 
Prince, and his difficulty in breathing. This 
pause proved fatal to A Iberto, because it was too 
sudden to be observed or understood by his an- 
tagonist, who on the instant along^d, and his 
sword passed through Alberto's left side. 

" By Heavens, that was the blow of an assas- 
sin," exclaimed the Duke, as he flew to assist his 
friend, w^ho had fallen to the earth. 

" Good God ! How could this happen," said 
Count Melendez, who was the very soul of honor, 
and had seen and understood Alberto's motive for 
putting himself off his guard. 

The prince was still in the dark, having been 
blinded by his ungovernable passions. 

Alberto had fainted from pain and loss of 
blood — By the aid of the surgeon, who was in 
attendance, he was coveyed to the Duke of Al-

meida's hotel, where every possible attention was 
paid him. 

Alberto's wound was very serious, yet owing 
to his excellent constitution, and his sweet tem- 
per, his medical attendants entertained sanguine 
hopes of his ultimate recovery. 

The poor young Prince was a prey to all the 
bitterness of a self-accusing conscience, and re- 
fused to leave the couch of the v^ounded man, 
who for several hours continued insensible to all 
surrounding objects.

THE NUN. 

Laura's only parent had been dead two months, 
when the ceremony of her taking the veil was to 
bfe celebrated with unusual solemnity at Naples. 

The Marquis St. Betise, whose late narrow es- 
cape had put him in a very good humour, enga- 
ged a very large party to witness this imposing 
spectacle, Laura having endowed the convent of 
St. Lorenza, with the bulk of her large fortune. 

The Cardinal Poco-puranti, who accompanied 
his niece to the chapel, appeared on that morning 
to be much agitated, and deeply impressed with 
melancholy thoughts. 'J'he tremendous peal of the 
deep-toned organ, the melodious voice of the 
nuns, contrasted with the solemn tones of the 


230 CLAUA GAZUL. 

monks, the pure odour of the burning incense, the 
richness and grandeur of the splendidly decorated 
chapel, together with the impression the tout en- 
semble made on me, I will not attempt to de- 
scribe. 

Laura's pale countenance was expressive of 
such inward calm, as this world cannot give. 
The trace of past anguish and rude suffering 
was still visible in the premature lines which 
their intenseness had marked upon her forehead, 
and in her sunken eye and faded bloom: but 
nature had done with its strife, and the late suf- 
ferer's mind was now at rest. Dreadful had been 
the ordeal she had passed, but it had purified her 
heart, and she appeared to bid adieu to the busy 
world, and all its feverish pleasures and excite- 
ments, with real satisfaction— yet, perhaps, she 
had never been beloved with such true and heart- 
felt tenderness, as at this moment. 

The sweet calm expression of her beautiful 
Roman features, was only once disturbed, during 
the whole of that long and touching ceremony 


CLAR GAZUL. '231 

which was to separate her froni the world for 
ever — - When her eyes suddenly encountered 
the intense gaze of her late lover, then did the last 
tear of human passion, steal down her pale cheek. 

One long, long gaze, did poor Laura indulge 
in! — and as she gazed, her cheek was flushed, 
her eyes beamed with love, and her heart was 
seen to palpitate beneath the rich vest that was 
so soon to be cast aside for ever. 

At length, she slowly raised her head, whilst a 
sigh escaped her bosom, and her lips moved. — She 
surely prayed for their eternal union. Gradually 
her classical but lovely features, resumed their 
wonted stillness and serenity. The ceremony was 
closing: she bowed her head, with meek humility, 
and the black veil shut out the light of her 
lover's countenance for ever.

A SICK CHAMBER. 


Alberto's duel made a great sensation in Na- 
ples, and the Prince Orazio's conduct was much 
censured. His Highness insisted on passing the 
night by the bed side of the wounded Count, who 
obtained some disturbed sleep. 

On opening his eyes the following morning at 
a very early hour, he stretched out his hand to 
the Prince, and in a faint voice expressed to him 
his sincere forgiveness for the misfortune which 
he felt sure had happened accidentally. The 
poor young Prince shed tears of regret. He 
seemed to be dying of a consumption. 

" I shall never forgive myself, if and Ora- 

zio paused. 


CLARA GAZUL. 233 

* But I shall soon recover,— I feel I shall," re- 
plied Alberto, who was in violent pain. The 
surgeons afterwards made their appearance, and 
having dressed the wound, gave a favorable account 
of their patient, whose pulse was as calm as could 
possibly be expected. In another week, Alberto 
was out of danger, and able to converse. 

*' Do, pray, take pity upon all these fair ones, 
and get well," said the Duke of Almeida, one 
morning, when he entered Alberto's chamber, 
whilst placing on his table at least half a dozen 
billets doux of all colours, qui sentoient la rose*. — 
Alberto smiled faintly as he examined them one 
by one, and then placed them aside without open- 
ing them or making any remark. 

You are a very sly personage, said the Duke," 
adding, " I know the characters of that little three- 
cornered note well, however, she may attem|>t to 
disguise her writing;— that note came from the 
Signora Lorenza." 

* Rose scented.

** My friend takes great liberties with my cor- 
respondence ; is it not so Prince ?*' said Alberto 
to his Highness Orazio, who had just called upon 
him. 

" But you must be impatient, and our presence 
prevents the indulgence of your curiosity," said 
his Highness, taking up his gloves. 

*' Sit down Orazio,"" observed the Duke, " Al- 
berto is the most phlegmatic man alive, with re- 
gard to the other sex, being literally surfeited 
with their kmdness " 

" It were more liberal in a friend to suspect me 
of being in love, than to set me down as a cox- 
comb," observed Alberto, whose illness had chan- 
ged him from the most striking of all male beau- 
ties, to one of the gentlest and most interesting in- 
vahds that ever reclined on a couch of down. 

"You in love!!" exclaimed the Duke — "I 
wont believe a word of it. It were an infamous 
monopoly ! nature only turns out a man like you, 
once in an age, and when she does, it is for the be- 
nefit of woman kind. 


CLARA GAZUL. 235 

" What, all the women of the age?" said the 
Prince laughing. 

" The Lord have mercy upon me," sighed Al- 
berto, alluding to his actual state of extreme de- 
bility, adding, " unless you would frighten back 
a relapse Almeida, let us change the subject ;— 
What is the news of the day?" 

" That contemptible ass St. B^tise, brings out 
his opera, next week," said the Prince. 

" I will make a bet with you that it is damned 
on the first representation," observed the Duke of 
Almeida. 

** It shall not be my fault if it is not," replied 
the Prince. 

** Oh pray, pray, take pity on poor B^tise," 
said Alberto, who, whether bandit or saint, was 
clearly the best natured man alive. 

** Why," said Almeida, '*I should have guessed 
that you wished St Betise at the devil, after all 
you have suflfered on his account.*' 

" Oh! true, I had forgotten that," replied the 
Count, '* but then it requires such an immeosity 


236 CLARA GAZUL. 

of trouble to write an opera, and the poor fellow 
has dream't of nothing else for the last five years. 
Voyons done mon ami*/' he continued address- 
ing the Prince '* Je vais vous faire une propK)si- 
tion, the Marchesa St. B6tise, plays the principal

" That I fear, were impossible," replied the un- 
fortunate Prince, reddening with pleasure at the 
bare thought of being once more admitted to her 
presence whom he adored beyond all things on 
earth. 

" Oh ! que non !"t replied the Count, only pro- 
mise me you will let the poor man's opera alone, 
and I will use my influence, which is, I assure you, 
all powerful with him. 

" Agreed," said Orazio, with a glowing cheek, 
presenting his hand to the Count, 

" Voila ! C'est d^cidej — You shall have a card 
to morrow," said Alberto. 

A servant tapped at the door, which was open-

ed by the Duke—" A page lias called for the an- 
swer to a srnall note that was sent to the Count 
Alberto this morning," said the servant. The 
Count, in some confusion, promised to send the 
answer in tl)e course of the day. The servant 
made hisj appearance a second time ; one single 
line was required, and the page had received po- 
sitive orders, not to return without it. 

** Why you cruel fellow," said the Duke, pla- 
cing the inkstand near Alberto. 

" Do not rise Count, you will but disturb your 
wound," hastily exclaimed the young Prince. 

** I must not be uncivil," said Alberto looking 
over the unsealed letters, but I really cannot guess 
which of these epistles I am at this moment cal- 
led upon to answer. 

L'embarras de choix,*" exclaimed Almeida, 
laughing at the Count. 

" Confusion, you have dropped one," said the 
Prince, and having picked up the note that had

238 CLARA GAZUL 

fallen to the ground, his eyes had scarcely glan- 
ced over it, when he turned as pale as death, and 
staggered towards a chair. 

*' What is the matter with you, Prince?" said 
Alberto, with eager good nature, adding, "upon 
my honor, there must be some mistake here, I 
never saw this hand-writing in my life before, the 
letter is probably not meant for me." The poor 
young Prince trembled violently, and his agitation 
was so excessive, as to excite pity. 

" Upon my honor it is too bad your correspond- 
ing thus with every body's wives and mistresses," 
said the Duke to the Count in a tone of reproach. 

Alberto protested his perfect ignorance on the 
subject of the note in question, which was directed 
in a hand he had never before seen. 

"That note is written by the Marchesa de St. 
B^tise ?" said the Prince in a tone of desperation. 

" Then it probably contains no secrets," said 
Alberto, breaking open the seal and having hasti- 
ly and anxiously cast his eyes over the contents, 


CLAKA GAZUL. "JSP 

" C'est la montagnequi s' accouche,"* said he, 

with a smile, as he handed over the Marchesa*s 
note to the Prince. 

It's contents were as follows : — 

"The Marchesa de St. Betise presents her 
''compliments to the Count Alberto; the Mar- 
" quis de St. Betise being entirely occupied with 
"his opera, has requested the Marchesa to make 
" his excuses, and to entreat that the Count Al- 
" berto will favor him with some account of his 
" health by the bearer.** 

" This is too ridiculous," said the Duke laugh- 
ing ; — the Prince began to breath freely and re- 
cover his serenity. 

Alberto having contrived to answer this note 
in a single line expressive of his thanks &c. &c. 
and dispatched it, the Duke Almeida who had 
taken up her ladyship's formal epistle par non-

chalance, suddenly exclaimed—" but there is a 
postscript, and a lady's postscript is sure to con- 
tain all that is worth reading in her letter." 

*' What are you dreaming about Almeida ?" 
said Alberto, holding out his hand for the letter. 

" Only two words, don't be frightened Prince — 
Have I your permission Alberto?" — Alberto 
nodded assent, and the Duke shewed his highness 
two little words at the bottom of the note writ- 
ten with pencil as fine as a hair and scarcely visi- 
ble. The Prince read " Da capo" which Alberto 
guessed to mean " more kisses," while he professed 
and declared that it could not of possibility mean 
anything. 

" But the Signora is so cunning," observed 
the Prince with a deep sigh. 

** By heavens they are all alike," exclaimed the 
Duke, and then expressed his surprise at Orazio's 
infatuation ; adding, *' what if we were to give 
you ocular proof that the Marchesa is to be won 
in a week ?" 

" Alas it would but send me to my grave a few 


CLARA GAZUL. 241 

days sooner than I should else have arrived there 
in the course of nature." said poor Orazio, whose 
heart could love but once, and who was dying of 
decline, occasioned by the extraordinary excite- 
ment which the Marchesa's blandishments had 
brought into play too early in life ; and thus pre- 
maturely forced to bloom for an hour, the young 
Prince now drooped his head like an exotic plant, 
whose hour of glory had passed away to return 
no more.

CHAP. XXX 


THE FIRST REPRESENTATION OF AN OPERA. 

AiiL was confusion, consternation, joy, grief, fid- 
dling, recitative-ing, and excitation at our Palace 
of St. B^tise, for five days previous to the long 
sighed for representation of the Marquis*s new 
opera. 

The Signor Falsetto, leader of the band, was 

nearly going mad for nine and twenty reasons 

Amongst others the Signor Gracioso would only 
sing just exactly what he had learn* t. — Falsetto 
wished to change but a single bar for the sake of 
finer harmony, but the man was a mule and in 
his ent^iement, he vowed there would be discord 
in one of the melodies. 


CLARA GAZUL. 243 

St. B^tise defied Falsetto to prove it, and ap- 
pealed to Tantini — Tantini, as usual, bowed to the 
judgment of his patron. 

The Marchesa had been made to rehearse till 
she had lost her voice, and as to the poor Marquis, 
he looked like an inhabitant of the other world 
from very fatigue. 

At last came the day, "big with the fate of 
B6tise and his opera!!" Every servant in the 
palace was presented with a new suit of clothes 
and a ticket 

The Prince Orazio received a card of invitation, 
the Marquis being completely in the power of 

Alberto who had applied for it. The first act 

was well received. — The Marchesa as a blind 
Princess looked so interesting, that her hoarseness 
was forgotten. I observed the Prince Orazio in 
one of the stage boxes, leaning his back in his 
chair with his eyes fixed on her charming face, 
and 1 sighed to observe the dreadful ravage that 
sickness had made in a youth, of late of so much 
promise, who now appeared scarcely able to sup- 


244 CLARA GAZUL. 

port himself, his bloodless cheek vieing with the 
Jilly in its delicacy of tint. 

Soonshal't thou be at rest, poor child of passion 
and affliction ! long, long e're thou has*t counted 
twenty summers shall thy poor head be laid low 
in the tomb with thy noble ancestors! me thought 
—and as I gazed on his shrunken form and the 
melancholy expression of his features I felt the 
tears gush into my eyes. Thou art about to be 
cut off in the early bloom of thy life, poor sufferer, 
and while her whom thy heart has chosen ;— her 
for whom alone thou desirest to breathe is for- 
bidden to whisper one last word of pity in thine 
ear. God comfort thee, be thy youthful errors 
Orazio forgiven thee, sweet tender boy. 

Such was my inward reflection and prayer as I 
gazed on the livid features of the poor youth, who 
appeared to be fast fading away ; but I am most 
irregularly straying from my subject. 

The second act of this famous opera was less 
successful than the first; hisses were now heard 
occasionally, making a hard fight for pre-emi- 


CLARA GAZUL, 245 

nence over the reiterated shouts of applause that 
issued from the well bred throats of St. B6tise*s 
friends and supporters. As for the poor little man 
himself, I shall never forget his countenance; 
had he stood before a tribunal awaiting his sen- 
tence for high-treason, I question if it had been in 
the power or in the muscles of this little man*s 
physiognomy to have exhibited any additional 
terror or dismay. 

Now though I fear tlie Lady St. B^tise is no fa- 
vourite with my readers, yet for the sake of jus- 
tice towards poor human nature, be it known that 
in this, her husband*s hour of trial, the Marchesa 
evinced the true feelings of a friend, and in her 
anxiety for the success of his opera, even Orazio, 
her dear Orazio was forgotten. 

The hisses increased, and terminated in actual 
riot, spite of and in defiance of the presence of 
the great Cardinal Poco-puranti, whose province 
it was to regulate the police. 

" Why heavenly powers, this is too much, too 
insulting!" exclaimed the Marchesa, stamping 


246 CLARA GAZUL. 

her little foot in a phrenzy of passion, excited by 
the insulting hisses of the audience, and cries of 
" down with the fool St. B^tise and his opera," 
&c, 

*' My uncle is in fault," said she, " where is 
the Cardinal Poco-puranti ? — I will never, never 
forgive him, let us return home my dear husband 
— this is some private malice, Falsetto himself ad- 
mired your opera." 

" So did Tantini — n'est-il pas vrai ?"* said 
poor St. Betise, brushing a large tear from his 
eye. 

"Monseigneur! — il faut baisser pavilion,"t said 
Falsetto, showing his head at the box door. 

** Partons ! partons Marquis au nom du Seig- 
neur. Vite! vite! ou nous serons tu^s tous,"J 

exclaimed Fanchette, who had followed the Sig- 
ner Falsetto. 


* Is il not so ? 

t Wy liord — we must give in. 

^ Let us be off! — In the name of Heaven let us be olf— Quick 
quick or we bhail be ail killed* 


CLARA GAZUL. 247 

The riot increased, the curtain dropped, and 
the Marquis with his party, were glad to make a 
hasty retreat ; nor did our persecution end here; 
crowds followed us to the palace, hooting and 
shouting, and insulting the poor amateur noble- 
man and his opera, until the palace gates closed 
upon them, and secured the personal safety of the 
poor crest-fallen Marquis.

REVENGE — A DEATH. 


As WE were sitting at breakfast at a late hour, 
the following morning, the Count Alberto was 
announced. 

Comment done avez vous fait pour vous gu6rir 
si v!te, mon cher ami ?— Que je suis charm6 de 
vous voir !"* said the Marquis, embracing the 
Count. 

** Gently, gently," said Alberto, wincing with 
pain ; " my wound is not yet healed, but I am 
tired of confinement ; and hearing from the Duke 
Almeida, how shabbily you were used last night, 
I resolved to make you my first visit." 

* How have you managed to get well so soon ? — How delighted I 
am to see you.

" Wine is forbidden, else might I get sooner 
round perhaps," said Alberto, with a sickly smile, 
as he sunk on the sofa, quite exhausted. 

" Oh ! Quel dommage, car vous avez un talent 
pour boire du vin, ma foi l—c'est admirable" f 

" Le beau compliment, que vous me faites la,"J 
said Alberto rallying. 

" My dear friend," observed St. B^tise, " I am

grossly, coarsely insulted before my own people —

to-morrow morning you shall have something pi-

" Je vous remercie mille et mille fois,f'* said 
the Marquis. 

Alberto having an appointment with his surge- 
ons, now arose to depart; and the Marquis half 
consoled by this project of revenge on the Cardi- 
nal insisted uponaccompanying his amiable friend 
Alberto to his hotel. 

The satire on Poco-puranti which appeared in 
the papers two days afterwards, was the best 
poem that had been published for some years in 
Naples. 

Vainly did St B6tise labour to obtain the cre- 
dit of having composed a libel which was so very 
superior,; — so infinitely above his capacity: — 


* Nevertheless this pleasure has procured for me during the lait 
fifteen days the torments of hell, but let rae understand your atFair. 
f I thank you a thousand and a thousand times. 


252 CLARA GAZUL. 

no one of common sense, would allow him the 
credit of it ; but as his signature was attached to 
it in all the public newspapers, his Lordship was, 
of course, responsible to the Cardinal, who sent 
pff an express to his Holiness the Pope, at Rome, 
for advice how to redress an insult to the Ca- 
tholic church, of so palpable and public a nature 
as such an affront, offered to a Right Reverend 
Cardinal. 

His Holiness of Rome, jealous of the glory of 
the church, issued a mandate commanding the 
Marquis de St. Betise, to make full and ample 
apology, through the medium of all the public 
journals, on pain of being immediately banished 
from the kingdom of Italy. 

St. Betise vowed that he would rather be ban- 
ished to the regions below, than beg pardon of a 
sa * * * pedant * — a dandy priest — a medling,

nal!— c'^toit tout dire et puis.* 

** Parlons de vos propres aflfaireSjt** interrup- 
ted Alberto -" Why should you and all your fa- 
mily be banished for my poem ? I am a single 
man, and like one country about as well as ano- 
ther, I therefore, insist on taking the responsibi- 
lity on myself." 

Then said St. B^tise " je lui cracherai au nez 
pendant la messe,:}: rather than pocket such affronts 
as I have received." 

Alberto seeing it was in vain to contend, at 
length gave up the point; and merely tendered 
his friendly assistance whenever he could be really 
of service. 

The Marchesa determined not to leave Naples, 
without taking leave of her lover, contrived, by 
the assistance of Fanchette and the Countess Dia-

blo, to effect her purpose, in defiance of locks, 
bolts, bars, or the devil. 

The lovers passed three hours in each others 
arms. The Marchesa wept all night, and w^as 
conveyed to her carriage, the next morning by her 
husband, in a state of miserable despondency. 
The Marquis determined to visit Paris, whither 
both earnestly desired me to accompany them, 
but having made up my mind to visit Mademoi- 
selle St. Sauveur, I declined. 

The Prince Orazio died in the arms of Alberto 
three days after the departure of the Marchesa. 

There was a charm not to be described in Al- 
berto's maimer and conversation, which attached 
all hearts. Affecting no superiority, frank, care- 
less, and perfectly indifferent about the effect he 
produced, he was continualy astonishing those 
who knew him most by some unexpected, unos- 
tentatious act of generosity or benevolence; yet he 
owned himself a rou6, and looked like a bandit — 
professed to love hard drinking, as well as women 
in abundance. Nevertheless, the Prince Orazio, 


CLARA GAZUL 255 

bred up in the strictest principles of religion, was 
never so calm, or so reconciled to his fate, as 
whilst listening to the conversation of Alberto. 

His Highnesses relatives remonstrated, so did 
his confessor, but Orazio was sleepy and heard 
them not He would take no medicine or nourish- 
ment but from the hands of Alberto, and when 
his breathing became so oppressed as to render it 
impossible for him to lay down, Alberto contriv- 
ed an easy position for the poor youth on his 
own breast, spite of the pain it must have occa- 
sioned to his wound, which was but half cured. 

In this position, Orazio awoke one morning 
after having enjoyed more than an hour's quiet 

sleep ** Alberto," said he faintly *' is your 

wound quite healed ?" 

"Aye long ago my dear boy," was the Count's 
quick reply. 

** I have deeply repented me," said poor Orazio 
in a still fainter voice, and then pressing his feeble 
arms about Alberto's neck, he fell again asleep on 
his bosom and awoke no more.

CHAP. XXXII 


A LETTER FROM EUGENIO. 


About this time I received letters from the 
Countess Polignac, and another from her son le 
beau page, who wrote in high spirits having mira- 
culously established his freedom at the very mo- 
ment he had been about to lose it, under the fol- 
lowing circumstances. 

Lady Anna Maria D bad fallen in love 

with Eugenio, the first night he had danced with 
her: Eugenio was not aware of this circum- 
stance. True, her Ladyship liked to obtain him 
for a partner in the dance, but then, as he knew 
well that he excelled in that accomplishment, he 
felt no surprise at her preference. 


CLARA GAZUL. 257 

At length her uncle Lord M called on Eu- 
genic to enquire what were his intentions with 
regard to his niece. 

Eugenio in much surprise assured the noble 
Lord that he did not understand his question. 

" Will you marry my niece r" asked his Lord- 
ship, 

" Why my Lord you are surely jokuig," re- 
plied the Page, '* there never was any question 
of such a thing, the ybung lady has never thought 
about me;— to be brief, my Lord was furious, 
hinted something about satisfaction — declared the 
peace of mind of his niece was destroyed — my 

Lady M joined her husband — was in tears — 

sobbed — knew the heart of her niece, and was sure 
it could love but once. The Countess Polignac 
afterwards added her entreaties to those of the 
disconsolate uncle and aunt. Eugenio was led to 
believe he had been wrong to have danced so 

constantly with Lady Anna Maria . It was 

an excellent match too in the opinion of the Lady 
Tom. IL ll 


258 CLARA GAZUL. 

Polignac, and so Eugenio had proposed to her 
Ladyship in despair — for he loved her not. 

As the time drew near for the celebration of 
his marriage, Eugenio's courage almost failed him, 
and growing more and more indifferent to her 
Ladyship, he resolved to make one desperate 
effort for his freedom ; so after considering and 
reflecting night and day as to the best method of 
curing my Lady of her desire to be united to 
him, he at length was fortunate enough to hit 
upon an effectual remedy or antidote to love. 

A dentist who resided in the metropolis, was 
entrusted with his secret. This artist permitted 
him to hire two complete rows of false teeth 
exactly like his own, which being neatly packed 
in a small pink card box, the dentist was induced 
to make out an elegant bill, on the top of which 
his name, address, and profession was gracefully 
printed. 

The bill ran thus — and was addressed to I: u- 
genio. To a complete set of composition teeth 
and gums, set in pure gold, ^15 15s. 


CLARA GAZUL. 259 

Eugenio hugged the dentist in his arms, so 
great was his joy at the prospect of a speedy de- 
liverance, for Lady Anna Maria in the fullness of 
her love, had spoken with rapture of the beauty of 
Eugenio's teeth. 

She was a spoiled silly heiress, accustomed to 
the indulgence of all her caprices, and Eugenio 
knew well, that in her eyes, his personal attrac- 
tioi^ were all she had understood or appreciated. 
Armed then, with his "bane and antidote,** Euge- 
nio tlew to his longing fair one, who listened with 
rapture to his discourse, when after a short visit, 
pleading an engagement, he took his departure, 
but not till he had contrived to drop the little 
pink box containing the false teeth and bill of the 
same, softly on the carpet The rest has been an- 
ticipated the match was off— the uncle apolo- 
gized for the caprices of an heiress, but declared 
he could not help it. Eugenio having no inclina- 
tion to call him to account, they had parted on 
good terms. 

Eugenio's letter to me proceeded thus: — 

### Page 260

> With my new friend Lord Ricketty, I frequent all sorts and descriptions of people, in order that I may become the wiser for my travels, instead of confining myself to the regular routine of morning visits to ladies bowers, clubhouses, park, gardens, &c.
> 
> Amongst other odd characters last week, we went to visit Sir Gregor Macgregor, Cazique of Poyais, who received us with real dignified Scotch politeness,and was growing very affable, when he espied a little bit of my watch ribbon. "Mr. Eugenio," said he, "if my eyes do not deceive me, you wear a green watch ribbon edged with silver."
> 
> "You are quite right Sir", I replied, and the high blood glowed deep on his royal cheek.
> 
> "Do you particularly desire to wear that ribbon to your watch, Mr. Eugenio," he enquired. 
>
> "Why Sir," I replied, while drawing down the watch ribbon and spreading it to the best 


### Page 261 

> advantage over my trowsers, "why really Sir I think it is very pretty and becoming."
>
> "Don't let me catch you with it in Poyais", said the King of savages, between joking and right-earnest, adding, "if my aid-de-camp was to see that ribbon, he would call you out"
>
> The aid-de-camp abruptly entered the room at this moment. The Viscount de Arenas was his name; (newly created). He had served in America, where he had suffered great hardships, and though a young man, was now a martyr to the rheumatism. "Me fight him?" observed the aid-de-camp looking towards his Prince ruefully, while rubbing his rheumatic leg. "Me!"

> "My good Lord, your Highness don't consider my lumbago — I can't think of any thing of the kind."

> I now in a whisper requested his Majesty's booing Scotch Secretary for the Home Department, who sat at his desk, in a remote corner, to inform me how my watch ribbon came to be honored by the notice of royalty. 

> "That ribbon," replied the Home Secretary 


### Page 262

> in my ear, "is the ribbon which his Highness calls the decoration of his most christian order of the Green Cross. His Highness is the Grand Master and Institutor of it."

> "*De tout mon coeur*", said I, and I then informed the Cazique King that green and silver were the Swiss colours also, in proof of which I pulled out of my pocket a small silver and green cockade, which had been worn by my particular friend in the Swiss guards of Napoleon Bonaparte. 

> The royal hand was extended with eagerness for the cockade, when having examined it's colours minutely, he expressed his doubts whether it was not green and gold, instead of green and silver. 

> "The silver is tarnished and grown yellow", I observed.

> The King was uneasy — touch his honor touch his life. 

> "*C'était une grande question!!!*"

> The cockade was handed over to each person


### Page 263 

> in the room, "gold," said one, "silver", said another, "gold," said a third. "But our time is precious," observed the Cazique at length, "and I must apologize for proceeding to dictate to my private Secretary the laws of Poyais for publication."

> We begged he would use no ceremony with us, when he proceeded forth-with to dictate to his honored Secretary as follows: 

> "After the Trojan War," said the Cazique, using the most extraordinary gesticulations, "after the Trojan war several Greek generals who had assisted in it, went and formed distant states, which at a later period became powerful, and I, who had contributed to the destruction of the Spanish domination in South America, did afterwards land on a coast inhabited by savages to lay the foundation of a new empire The state of Poyais is created!! The green and white flag floats in the shade of the vast forest which covers the country, and I who have so long sacrificed my dear Scotch blood, and my fortune for 


### Page 264

> a republic, am become Gregor, by the grace of God, Cazique of Poyais, which is the same thing as King of Poyais — hurrah!! 

> "But apropos, it was all nonsense my sitting under a mahogany tree, smoking cigars all my life, as a simple chief of a handful of naked savages; I who had resolved to place myself on an equality with the sovereigns of Europe! I want a court! — a parliament! — and a well disciplined army; and one cannot make good senators or soldiers, out of mere wild men, accustomed to live without even the shelter of a hut, upon wild fruits, and the animal food they can procure, with their bows and arrows; no making courtiers, orators, generals, judges, or state counsellors, out of these sort of beings scarcely fit for drummers and trumpeters."

> "Stultz, himself, could make nothing of them: men must be civilized, or pass for such at least before they can fill such noble functions with proper dignity; and, therefore, we abandoned our royal territory, and loving subjects to come 

### Page 265 

> and seek in Europe, men fit to instruct and civilize them."

> "We soon found what we required, but this was not all. A king without money, is no great shakes, in the eyes of the world, but then, as good luck would have it, a king, be he ever so poverty struck, has always credit; therefore, I, Gregor the First, by the grace of God, succeeded in raising the wind, by a loan, in the name of the principality of Poyais, and all this was done without having been ever dream't of by our good and loving subjects of Poyais, who knew no more of what was passing in our Palace of Maison Villette, Champs Elysees, than the Grand Turk, where I instituted laws for my people's happiness, viz. as follows."

> "All Poyaisians shall be considered equal, whether black, brown, or fair."

> "Alas! Then, farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness," ejaculated the newly created Viscount de Arenas. 

### Page 326

> "I dont mention my Marquisate" sighed out De Bracma

> "*Cela ne vaut guère la peine*" I observed, en passant. 

> "Blockhead!!" said the King in a fury addressing himself especially to his secretary  for the aid-de-camp was restive under favor of correction; — "Ass!!! I am speaking of equality in law."

> The Marquis's obsequious bow, said plainly, "E'en and for ever as thou pleaseth dread Prince!"

> His majesty proceeded to dictate his laws as follows: 

> "Our state is divided into twelve provinces. The Isles of Roatan and Guanaja, Caribania, Romanic, Tinto, Carthage, Neustrie Panamakas, Towkas, Cackeras, Woolwas, Fiolano, and Ramas — there is, that is, there shall be a parliament composed of a senate and house of assembly to enact the laws."

> "The Cazique of Poyais shall name and choose just whom he pleases to fulfill his will and pleasure in the 

### Page 327 

> great offices of state — for toleration, gentlemen, toleration is the order of the day."

> "The Poyaisian Religion shall be Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman."

> "That is to say", rudely interrupted, * * * "that though the Poyaisians are now all Pagans, your religious zeal, aided by your pious missionaries, cannot fail to convert them to the true faith."

> "*Cependant tout catholique que vous 6tes Monsieur le Cazique, vous avez mangé du rost bif avec bon appetit vendredi passe*," observed Lord Ricketty, and then begged pardon for interrupting the dictation. 

> "You are privileged," said the Cazique, bowing with a gracious smile, and proceeded as follows: 

>  "All debts which the Cazique of Poyais shall contract at any time, either in the Rue Mont-Martre, or any where else, are hereby declared public debts, so that while my loving subjects 


### Page 268

> are dancing about naked, and existing on the flesh of wild animals, they are bound to provide out of the produce of their soil for all my sumptuous dinners at the Maison Villette — also, for the construction and creation of my Green Cross, and armorial bearings, seeing that all this tends to the future prosperity of Poyaisians. "

> "That queer quiz De Bracma has pawned his cross for fifteen francs," observed the Viscount de Arenas. 

> Before the king could recover from his royal rage at this discovery, a phantom appeared before him, in the form of his late state footman Gabriel, now dressed up in the identical state coat which his Majesty presented to the Marquis, when he represented him at Madrid in the year 1823, as his highly honored ambassador and plenipotentiary, with all his appendages to have and to hold by, &c. The said coat was of clear bright green, lined with white, adorned with the royal button, and the collar was scarlet. 


### Page 269 

> It was, in truth, a very pretty coat, and Gabriel had given the most noble Marquis de Bracma, twenty francs for it, to pay his washerwoman's bill. 

> The king stormed, raved, and dashed his cigar against the wall— The Marquis fell on his knees — The Viscount de Arenas, declared it was a great shame — Lord Ricketty and myself laughed, and Gabriel ran out of the room, Poyaisian court dress and all. 

> It was some time before peace was restored, the king then proceeded to dictate his laws which are too long to transcribe in full, I will but trouble you with another slight specimen, and then change the subject.

> "Our eldest, son, born American, the issue of our marriage with Dona Josefa Antonia Andrea de Xeres d’Aristegueta y Lobera Bolivar, born at Caracas, in the republic of Colombia, is declared presumptive heir to the dignity of Cazique of  Poyais. — *honi soit qui mal y pense!!!*"

### Page 270

> After we had taken our leave of the Cazique of Poyais, I asked Lord Ricketty how he came to be a Cazique? 

> "Why," replied his Lordship, "he got a few blankets and tin trumpets, a little gun powder, and a box of cigars, which the king of savages was graciously pleased to accept in exchange for his Mosquito kingdom, and his savage Majesty signed away his lands with the identical pen or feather which usually decorated the hinder part of his august person — so strange, but very true, his Majesty George Frederick, since assassinated, had learn't to write!!"

> "Do you consider the Cazique as a gentleman?" I enquired. 

> "Most assuredly, both by birth, character, and breeding — once upon a time to be sure he buccaneered a little, for which I have heard that General Bolivar was disposed to cut off his head, but that the Cazique at that critical moment, contrived to captivate the heart of his sister Dona Josefa and marry her; the son of which


### Page 271 

> marriage is heir apparent to the Columbian throne, should that state be ever erected into a monarchy under a Bolivar dynasty."

> "The Cazique, however eccentric or mad he may be in his dream of royalty, possesses certain delicate points of feeling which serve to distinguish him from that most contemptible thing, a being without any character at all. He is high couraged, and very firm, and has commanded and distinguished himself in several general actions. The lamented sacrifice to Spanish cruelty and Spanish bigotry made in the *cachots* of Cadiz where the celebrated and brave Miranda breathed his last, whilst confined as prisoner of war, put the Cazique then General MacGregor in the chief command — as the glorious conqueror of the Juncal, and of Morillo on the plains of Alacrán, he would have earned imperishable fame, if the siege of Carthagena was not destined to immortalize him."

> "I afterwards learned some anecdotes relative to the Cazique's unjust incarceration in the various

### Page 272

> Paris prisons La Force, La Conciergerie, and Bicêtre, for some political or nonsensical reason which does not now signify, since His Majesty was most honorably acquitted and publicly declared innocent. But the anecdotes, as I had them from excellent authority, may be worth relating. — A few days after the Cazique's imprisonment, he was visited by his lawyer, a young Swiss republican, who found the King at his usual occupation, pacing it up and down the room, with a cigar in his mouth, which was ever and anon removed and held up in the air between his thumb and third finger, dictating to his secretary, certain state matters, whilst in a corner of the room, a little charcoal was burning in a small portable stove."

> "How do you do General" said the Republican, who obstinately refused to acknowledge his sovereignty. 

> His Majesty was graciously pleased to put forth his hand to be pressed or kissed *a volonté*. 

> "What can I do to serve you General?" said the Republican,

### Page 273

> who was forthwith honoured with various commissions to his Sovereign Queen, to his children, and also to the lovely Countess who had found the way to his savage heart. “Say to my Countess,” said the Chief,  
> with something like pathos in his voice and manner, “Say to my Countess in the Rue Mont Martre, that”—and he hesitated—  
> “that I should thank her to bring me my flannel drawers!”—then turning round to his “Home Secretary,” the noble Marquis in the corner, his Majesty was beginning to dictate a few more lines, but the Scotch Marquis, rising and bowing almost to the earth, took the liberty of reminding His Highness that it was time for him  
> to skim the “pot-au-feu,” as he called it, and scrape the carrots.  
>
> The King bowed his assent, and then, hoping he had done with him, resumed his polite attention to his “homme d’affaires.”  
>
> “Au feu.”

### Page 274

> The noble Marquis advanced slowly towards his royal master on his toes, apparently in fear and trembling, and with one finger placed on his nose, he looked diplomatic and mysterious—stopped—opened his mouth to speak—then shut it again. At length the creaking of his Lordship’s shoes caught the royal ear, and made His Majesty turn hastily about.  
>
> “Well?” said the Chief, after taking his cigar from his mouth.  
>
> “I am sorry to disturb your Highness, but—”  
>
> “Well?” reiterated the King calmly.  
>
> The Marquis now ventured to approach, and with a bow between each word said, “There is a sous worth of pepper wanted for the soup.”  
>
> “Zounds,” said His Majesty in a passion, “can’t you give one a moment’s rest?”—at the same time presenting him with a two-sous piece, he desired him to bring back the change.  
>
> “Here! Stop!” called out the King, as the Marquis was going; “stop, I am ill, I can’t think what the devil is the matter with me; I—”

### Page 275

> “I have smoked forty cigars this morning, and find no relief. I wish you would buy me a bottle of the same physic I had before, and tell the man I will return the bottle directly I have swallow’d it.”  
>
> Away went the Marquis de Bracma (that was his title), and shortly returned with a rueful face, holding a little earthenware pot without a handle in his hand; and after the usual superabundance of bows, he informed His Majesty that the apothecary refused to lend the bottle, so, to save expense, he had brought the physic in the broken pot.  
>
> After a little more conversation, the lawyer took his departure in search of the Countess in the Rue Mont Martre, and the King’s flannel drawers.  
>
> Besides the Secretary and the aide-de-camp—the Viscount de —— (who had seen hard service in America, and though a young man was half dead with the rheumatism)—two

### Page 276

> Frenchmen slept in the same apartment with the King.  
>
> At an early hour the Viscount retired to his bed, and having no more cigars left, he declared himself starved with cold, being also without his flannel waistcoat, which was detained by his washer-woman for his bill. One of the Frenchmen threw open the window, just as the Viscount was beginning to perspire.  
>
> “I can’t stand that,” said the poor debilitated aide-de-camp.  
>
> “But you must stand it,” retorted the Frenchman, adding, with many *sacrés,* “that nobody but the devil could live in the atmosphere of so much smoking.”  
>
> The noble Viscount became furious, and, spite of his lumbago, he jumped out of bed, and contrived to attack the foreigner *en chemise,* but he had like to have suffered for his temerity. A mere skeleton, as weak as a child from his protracted sufferings, the Frenchman—


### Page 277

> seemed about to extinguish him at once, as though he had been a rush-light.  
>
> “For God’s sake lend me a hand, Marquis!” bawled out the aide-de-camp to the private secretary.  
>
> “Excuse me,” replied the wary Scotchman, “I am naturally pacific.”  
>
> “De Bracma!” called out the King, in a voice of thunder, “De Bracma!! I order you to assist the Viscount.”  
>
> With an unusual fit of spirit, caused by desperation, the Marquis stood up boldly on his toes and heels, and with a single bow, not too servile, he said, “I must recall to your Highness’s recollection that I have nothing to do with foreign service, being employed by your Highness in the Home Department.”  
>
> There was no time to waste in words of reproof, things looked menacingly. His Majesty seized hold of the Frenchman’s throat, who was no more in his hands than the aide-de-camp had been in the grasp of the Frenchman, when—


### Page 278

> having flung him against the wall, he calmly resumed his cigar, as little affected by the volley of abuse which issued from the lips of the prostrate Frenchman, as would have been a large, good-tempered Newfoundland dog at the impotent snarling and yelping of a vicious cur.  
>
> The Cazique, as I am led to understand from the person who related the above anecdotes, is an excellent companion and a *bon camarade* when he is pennyless; give him a guinea and he grows saucy,—give him a coach and six, with state liveries, &c., and he becomes the most selfish, ostentatious, proud Scotch bear on earth; but in every situation, and under any circumstance, I would, without hesitation, rely upon his word of honor.  
>
> The rest of Eugenio’s letter contained nothing interesting enough to amuse the reader; I will, therefore, conclude my chapter, having a new subject to treat them within the next.

NEWS FROM THE LADY POCOPURANTI. 

The Cardinal Poco-puranti*s collection of pictures 
was the finest in all Xaples, and his judgment 
was believed to be infinite. 

Among the family portraits that hung in the 
Lady Poco-puranti's small library, there were 
two that I was never tired of contemplating. 
The first was that of a young blushing bride, in 
all her pomp and magnificence, her eyes beaming 
with love, and her cheeks beaming with happi- 
ness. The picture represented her at that mo- 
ment, when the officiating priest had just con- 
cluded the ceremony, and the bride having pla- 
ced her hand in that of her happy husband, paus- 


280 CLARA GAZUL. 

ed at the foot of the altar, to receive the congra- 
tulations of some of her dearest friends. 

No description of mine could do justice to the 
beautiful expression of countenance, the animated 
thrill of happiness that was so ably portrayed in 
this picture, forming such a sweet and glowing 
contrast, with the manly beauty that so strongly 
characterized the young bridegroom. 

The second picture represented the same fe- 
male sitting on a stone in a village church-yard, 
in the north of England, with her hair dishevel- 
led, her features weather-beaten, and their ex- 
pression stern and awefully commanding, her 
poor garments dripping with rain, her eyes 
sunken, her gaze vacant, and her whole appear- 
ance denoting gaunt despair. 

When I resided at the Cardinal's, I had often 
expressed my curiosity to learn the history of 
these pictures, and the Lady Poco-puranti had 
promised to procure me a true sketch of the life 
of the female whose portraits had so forcibly at- 
tracted my attention. In the mean time all I 


CLARA GAZUL. 281 

could gather from the servants belonging to the 
household, was that the painting represented an 
heiress, whose great beauty and vast talents had 
made her the pride and glory of all her friends; 
that she had married an Rnglishman, and died 
miserable, that she \vas buried under the very 
stone on which the painter had represented her 
seated in the little church-yard. He was an En- 
glish artist, who being struck with her pictu- 
resque attitude and appearance as he travelled 
through North Wales, had made this fine pic- 
ture of her, which had been purchased by her 
late husband, since dead, at a very high price. 

The other picture had been long in the Cardi- 
nal's possession, and was the work of a celebrated 
Italian artist. 

How both pictures came at length to grace 

the library of his Eminence I know not; he was 

a man indefatigable, when he wanted to obtiin a 

picture, and would not only pay an exorbitant 

price for the gratification of his fancies whatever 

they might be, but has been known to travel a

"282 CLARA GAZUL. 

thousand miles to see one single picture on the 
speculation of it*s being a good one. 

A letter I received from the Lady Poco-puran- 
ti, the day of the Marquis St. Betise's departure 
from Napl^ contained the following paragraph: 
" I have sent the little story of the pictures I pro- 
" mised you, under the impression that it is caU 
" culated to amuse you.** 

THE PICTURES. 

" The purest friendship that ever warmed the 
human breast, once existed in the hearts of Cora 
and Antonia. Both were Neapolitans of noble 
birth. 

" Signora Cora lost her parents, when very young 
from whom she inherited a princely estate. Her 
countenance was the most majestic and comman- 
dii^ that could well be imagined, and the bright- 
ness of her dark eyes was so peculiarly striking, 
that it almost dazzled, and might have awed at the 
first glance, but for her bland and dimpled smile. 

" The homage which was voluntarily paid to 
Cora, seemed to denote her as a being enshrined, 


CLARA GAZUL. 283 

and formed to be \^orshipped, her talents were so 
versatile and her capacity and quickness so extra- 
ordinary. 

At the commencement of this httle narrative, 
Cora*s heart had been never touched with any 
warmer sentiments than that glowing friendship 
which, bad fair to endure for ever. 

" It may easily be imagined that an heiress of 
such dazzelling accomplishments, was the boast 
and glory of all Naples. 

Cora, the haughty Cora would often steal 
away from the rich banquet, or lively dance, to 
attend the couch of age and sickness. In short, so 
widely was her wealth diffused in befriending the 
widows and distressed orphans which abound in 
her unfortunate but lovely country that she had 
seriously injured her own property. 

*' In vain did her friends remonstrate, Cora was 
a spoiled child, and her will was law. * These 
young innocent people love each other,' she 
would say, * Shall I doom them to live in anxious 
solitude, while I have the power to unite them r 


284 CLARA GAZUL. 

Shall I stand by and see that venerable man go 
to prison, while my cotlers are filled with gold ?" 

** Cora, however, never condescended to offer 
the slightest apology for any part of her conduct, 
but to her good nurse Isabella, whom she loved 
as a mother. 

" Antonia, her friend, was two years her senior, 
but a stranger had guessed Cora to be the elder, for 
Antonia possessed none of that decision and firm- 
ness of character which distinguished Cora. On the 
contrary, she was the most effeminate and gentle 
of human beings; her soft blue eyes, half conceal- 
ed by their silken fringes, her varying com- 
plexion, and her timid uncertain step, formed the 
strangest contrast that could be well imagined, 

Antonia had lately attended a fond father to 
the grave, and was now the sole link that attach- 
ed her sorrowing mother to the world. 

Belford, a young Enghsh gentleman, paid his 
addresses to Cora, while Antonia was on a visit 
to an aunt who resided at Rome. Cora's 
pride struggled against her first growing passion 


CLARA GAZUL. 285 

lor a foreigner, bul real ardent feelings cannot 
long be concealed. 

Belford's first advances, were cooly received ; 
but when in pique he had absented himself from 
her palace, Cora's spirit sunk at once. Belford 
on his return from Florence found her wasted and 
much altered, and guessing the cause of her deep 
melancholy, again made her the offer of his hand. 
Alas ! pride makes but a poor fight against the 
feelings of the heart. 

" Cora had suffered too much, and her strength 
was reduced to the feebleness of infancy. Her 
wealth, and her noble birth w ere all forgotten. 
She sunk on the earth, kissed his feet, and sobbed 
aloud. 

" Belford raised her in his arms, and pressed 
her closely to his heart. 

'* Their nuptials were to be celebrated during 
the ensuing month, and Antonia was invited to 
witness the happiness of her friend. 

** Belford belonged to the church of England, 


2b6 CLARA GAZUL. 

but Cora obtained his promise to allow her chil- 
dren to be educated in the Catholic faith. 

" They passed the first year of their marri- 
age in England, and their happiness was pure and 
uninterrupted. Belford proud of his beautiful 
wife, presented her to his English friends ; and 
Cora*s English celebrity fell little short of that 
enthusiastic admiration she had inspired in her 
own country. 

** Antonia who had accompanied them to En- 
gland visibly declined. Absorbed in profound 
melancholy like a fair lilly, she drooped and none 
knew or could guess the cause. 

" Vainly did the beautiful Cora, now in an ad- 
vanced state of pregnancy, exert all her brilliant 
talents to amuse and calm the agitation of her 
friend's mind. She grew worse — physicians 
were called in, who pronounced the disease to 
be of the mind. 

" * You shall return dear Antonia to Naples/ 
said Cora to her, one still summer's evening, after 
having exhausted her strength in vain efforts to 


CLARA GAZUL. 287 

tranquillize her tViend ; " we will return together 
immediately after my confinement. This atmos- 
phere is dense and heavy ; I too am affected by 
it to night* 

** *Oh! you are too, too happy!' said Antonia, 
raising her starry eyes to the face of her friend. 

** ' Hourly I thank my God for the blessings of 
my husband's true affection," answered Cora, 
*and yet this night I feel a desponding presenti- 
ment of coming evil. It is not the expected 
pangs of child-birth that frighten me; true, I 
am no stoic, and Aature may force from me the 
cries of bodily anguish, but it is not this alone 
that weighs upon my mind to-night.' 

" Cora's lovely face was covered with an ashy 
paleness. The friends pressed in each others 
arms, shed torrents of bitter tears. Belford 
surprised them, and was unusually affected with 
their melancholy. 

" * Let us pray the Father of Mercies to grant 
us that peace which the world cannot give,' said 
Cora. 


288 CLAR-A GAZUL. 

*' * Dear Antonia, she continued, * sing to us the 
hymn I last night composed, and we will join 
you.' Cora sank on her knees and raised her 
pale face towards the bright moon which just 
shone out for a moment through a watery cloud. 

" Bel ford followed her example, the hour of 
trial was at hand, when Cora was to become a 
mother and he offered up a fervent prayer for 
her safety. 

*' While they were yet kneelinL', a tremendous 
peal of thunder shook the roof, and almost made 
the earth tremble underneath. . ;A ntonia uttered a 
loud scream, and Cora fell senseless to the 
ground. She was awoke by the sharp pangs of 
labour, and after twenty hours of severe anguish, 
which she endured without a single murmur, was 
safely delivered of a lovely boy. 

*' Antonia's spirits seemed now to sink beyond 
the powers of rallying, even for an instant, and as 
soon as her friend was able to travel, she earnestly 
implored to be conveyed to Naples, to die in her 
mother's arms. Cora believing that her friend's

health might be thus restored to her, lost no 
time in preparing for her departure, accompanied 
by her husband, and lovely infant with his nurse. 

*' In less than three months after her confine- 
ment, Cora had the pleasure of seeing Antonia 
pressed to her mother's heart. 

" Belford was of Italian descent, and the abbot 
of the monastery of St. Eustache, near Naples, was 
related to him. 

*• The monks of St. Eustache were a set of 
merry friars, who loved their jokes like other 
men, and their feastings and carousings astonish- 
ed Belford. 

"One night when these merry wags, assisted 
by the Tuscan juice, had coaxed him out of his 
reason, he declared that he would turn father 
confessor: — * Now by the Holy Virgin,' added 
he, and addressing the most celebrated confessor 
in Naples, * would I not begrudge five hundred 
louis d'or to be under your cowl on Good Friday 
next.' 

" * Come hither,* said the confessor in a whis-

290 CLARA GAZUL. 

per, dragging him from the table, ' I know your 
high sense of honor, and I will trust you ; — but 
my life will be in your hands. Swear not to be- 
tray me,' continued the confessor, touching Bel- 
ford's lips with his rosary, * and you shall shrive 
the noble dames of Naples in the chapel of Sainte 
C'laire's Convent, on next Good Friday. 

" I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR !" 

'* Every thing being settled and arranged be- 
tween Belford and the confessor, the former re- 
turned home in high spirits. Belford possessed 
that sort of wavering, undecided character which 
often does more harm than confirmed viciousness. 
A slave to his temper or his tastes, they governed 
him at all times. His friends considered him a 
good-hearted, good-natured young man, because 
he was charitable and pitied the distresses which 
came immediately under his observation; but 
Belford possessed no depth of character, if I may 
thus express myself; no firmness of mind to con- 
tend against his caprices, and whether they were 


CLARA GAZUL. 291 

likely to serve or injure his fellow creatures was a 
consideration that seldom, or never troubled him. 

"Belfordhad loved the beautiful Cora passio- 
nately ; yet when he was first presented to Anto- 
nia. which it will be remembered, was not till he 
had been accepted by Cora, he had thought her 
the loveliest woman he had ever seen. 

" Cora's various and brilliant attractions, how- 
ever, had perhaps done more towards fixing his 
affections, than he had himself expected ; and his 
feelings for her friend had partaken of that bro- 
therly character which he might have gloried in 
displaying towards this interesting orphan, but 
that he had lately encouraged the idea that A n- 
tonia had conceived a violent passion for him, of 
which she was dying. 

" The deep blush that glowed on her pale 
cheek when he addressed her, and the violent agi- 
tation she evinced if any accident left them a 
moment alone, her obstinacy in resisting the en- 
treaties of Cora to induce her friend to accom- 


292 CLARA GAZUL. 

pany her husband in a walk, during her confine- 
ment had almost confirmed him in this opinion. 

" In bribing the mercenary confessor of Sainte . 
Claire, Belford imagined himself actuated by mere 
curiosity. He had shuddered at the idea of 
planting a dagger in the faithful heart of his ac- 
complished wife ; but there was surely no great 
harm in the innocent gratification of a little 
curiosity. 

** Himself of the church of England, he had 
often presumed to laugh most irreverently at fa- 
ther confessors in general, and now believed him- 
self quite as able to advise the fair ladies of Na- 
ples for the good of their souls, as the mercenary 
monk who had proved himself a disgrace to the 
cowl he thus resigned. 

" He found Cora watching by her friend's pil- 
low;— she was sketching her likeness as she slept. 

" ' Thank God you are returned,' said Cora, 
hastily throwing aside her pencil, and leading her 
husband out of the room. 

" * She sleeps calmly, we will not disturb her. 


CLARA GAZUL W3 

something whispers nie she will not long remain 
among us. Her eyes are sunken and she is too 
restless to remain in one position an instant when 
awake, and therefore, I must paint her sleeping 
thus, the image of death ! !' 

"* My beloved!' said Belford, * why will you 
anticipate misfortunes ? Antonia will recover, let 
us prevail on her mother to come and live with 
us.' 

** * It is done,' replied Cora, * to-morrow the 
Signora takes up her abode in this palace.' 

" On that important day when Belford was to 
take upon himself the office of confessor, to the 
chief sinning nobility of Naples, so well was 
everything contrived, and such the artifice of the 
insidious and lucre-loving monk, that surmise and 
suspicion were both completely baffled, or lulled 
to rest. 

" Imagine then the gay handsome Belford, 
seated in the confessional chair in the chapel of 
the convent of Sainte Claire, with his features 
completely concealed beneath his cowl. 


294 CLARA GAZUL. 

" I have already observed that Belford was ori- 
ginally of Italian descent, and he knev7 and spoke 
that language with the purity of a native. 

" Whilst shriving the high-born sisters of 
Sainte Claire, he was more than once on the point 
of laughing aloud in despite, and in the face of 
the dignity of his functions, particularly when an 
old parchment coloured nun declared to him that 
spite of fasting and prayers she had conceived a 
violent passion for the divine husband of la belle 
Cora, the Signor Belford, which passion destroy- 
ed her rest and caused her to turn, and tumble, 
and toss about in her bed. Many had swallowed 
potage gras on a Friday, some had committed 
larger, and others smaller sins, against the holy 
Roman Catholic and A postolic faith. 

" After the ladies of Sainte Claire, came many 
noble dames who confessed to more practical 
and decided peccadillos. Every change alarmed 
him. Towards the afternoon, he began to sus- 
pect that Antonia as though the fates were against 
him, would perhaps for the first time in her life 


CLARA GAZUL. 293 

omit coming to confess. At last some one sobbed 
in the confessional chair. 

" *Let the daughter in affliction speak and ob- 
tain absolution, by the humble confession of all 
her sins/ said Belford in a deep solemn tone. 

" * Father,' answered the soft voice of Antonia, 
* I have long concealed my weight of sin from 

you 1 dared not 1 could not trust myself 

to confess my crimes though the gates of mercy 
had been shut on me for ever.' 

" * Speak beloved daughter, and doubt not the 
mercy of our blessed Saviour.' 

" * My crimes bear no common character fa- 
ther/ retorted Antonia, struggling for firmness, 

'but 1 feel I am going to my God, and all 

things of this world fade before my sight. I want 

to be at rest as yet I have injured no one*s 

happiness — and therefore, on my knees, I offer up 
as atonement to my God this humble confession. 

" * Speak daughter, speak/ said Belford, with 
such uncontrolable impatience as well nigh be- 
trayed him. 


296 CLARA GAZUL. 

" * Father I shall sink under the task I have 
imposed on myself, if you address a poor dying 
sinner harshly.' 

" ' Nay daughter, I am but impatient* 

** * father -I 1 adore before all 

things in this or in the world to come, the 

the husband of my dearest friend the father of 

her blooming infant the hope and sole object 

for whom she breathes* 

** In vain were now all Belford's efforts to 

answer with the calm dignity of a confessor 

he coughed and held a handkerchief to his 

face, affecting to have a violent cold, for speak he 
could not, so much was he agitated. 

"•Father pity me speak com- 
fort to one who perhaps asks it of you for the 
last time on earth.' 

*' * Not so daughter,' said Belford at length 

* I was but considering the most perfect mode of 
restoring you to that peace of conscience you desire 
to obtain , but I am seized with sudden indispo- 
sition. I have much to say to you. Retire 


CLARA GAZUL. "2597 

daughter! go seek the tomb of tliy departed fa- 
ther, there pray my child with a contrite 

heart 1 will meet thee in an hour.* 

" * Near my parent's grave father ?' 

** ' Aye daughter/ 

** * Fare thee well. Father, I will meet thee near 
his ashes,* and she hastily departed. 

*' Belford, now hurried over his business in the 
most slovenly manner imaginable, and made va- 
rious mistakes in the distribution of penances. — 
An old woman was ordered to make a pilgri- 
mage barefooted, for a hasty word addressed to 
her maid, while a robber was condemned to re- 
peat only an ave maria or two, more than his 
usual dose, — At last Belford was free. 

" Thank God!' said he, throwing off his cowl 
as soon as he had reached the cell of the real con- 
fessor of Sainte Claire. 

** * All is safe,' said the monk, but you had bet- 
ter first pay a visit to the abbot, before you de- 
part— but he excused himself. 

"At length, arrived at the tomb of poor Anto- 

nia' i father, he aflected grtat surprise at finding*

her prostrated on the earth in ardent prayer with 
her face leaning over the ashes of her parent. * Oh 
Signora Antonia ! !' said he, seizing her hand, and 
raising it to his lips. 

". Antonia overcome with surprise, fell senseless 
in his arms. 

" The rays of the rising moon shone on her fair 
pale face, and tinged it with a hue scarce earthly. 
" Belford no longer master of himself profaned 
her innocent lips with wildly passionate kisses 

" * Antonia! sweet Antonia!' said Belford, and 
at the sound of that voice so dear to her, she 
opened her languid eyes. 

" ' You are now mine for ever,' exclaimed Bel- 
ford, and he again lavished more burning kisses on 
her lips. 

" ' Spare me cried A ntonia,' Have mercy on 
me, * for I am too weak to resist you.' 

" Her head sank on his breast, and honor and 
virtue were forgotten. 

*' Return we now to Cora. Having just given 
the last touch to the beautiful miniature of her 
sleeping friend, she began to feel anxious for her 


CLARA GAZUL. 299 

return ; latterly Antonia had fled from society, 
and in vain did Cora remonstrate. Antonia im- 
plored and begged on her knees to be left in soli- 
tude, to wander over the large garden of Cora's 
palace. 

" Cora and her nurse sought her there in vain. 
In dreadful alarm, Cora then bent her steps to- 
wards the tomb of Antonia's parent. — She paus- 
ed!'— 

** My beloved friend has fallen a prey to rob- 
bers or assassins, thought she, I may yet arrive 
in time to defend her' — She flew back to her 
boudoir, and hastily concealed her late father's 
dagger in her bosom. 

I have before hinted that Cora possessed a 
degree of masculine courage, joined to extreme 
generosity and benevolence of disposition. A 
dreadful assassination at that time had lately been 
committed within the walls of Naples, of which 
Alberto's band had been accused, since which pe- 
riod, Cora was not the only iemale who, as a mat- 


300 CLARA GAZUL. 

ter of self-defence, occasionally carried a dagger 
about their persons. 

" Cora's zeal soon left her old nurse far behind 
— she approached the tomb W The unfortunate 
Cora heard these words distinctly uttered in the 
voice of her husband — ' Look up, beloved one, 
thy love was involuntary, and I swear never to 
forsake thee.* 

" Dear Belford ! sighed the guilty Antonia, 
pressing him to her beating heart. 

" With the furious wildness of a maniac, her 
bright eyes issuing forth rays of unnatural light, 
Cora rushed forward, and plunged the dagger 
deep in the heart of Antonia, then fled with 
swiftness from the dreadful scene, obtained a 
neighbouring forest, where she sank on the 
earth quite exhausted, and the agony of her mind 
was relieved only by insensibility.' 

*' She was shortly aroused by one of her faith- 
ful servants whom her poor old nurse had dis- 
patched in search of her. 

"The holy saints protect thee lady !—- That I 


CLARA GAZUL. .301 

should live to see this bitter hour,' exclaimed 
the young man, whose name was Battista, wring- 
ing his hands — * Lady, for the love of the Virgin, 
disguise thyself quickly in the simple attire I here 
bring thee of our good young Rosalie; — already 
the officers of justice pursue thee !' — Cora stared 
wildly in his face. 

'* Lady ! for thy infant's sake, on my knees I 
implore thee, spare thy child the disgrace of sur- 
viving a mother's ignominious death ! 

" ' Yes ! Yes! Yes!' said Cora, in hurried ac- 
cents. 

" ' Away then ! 

" She now concealed herself and changed her 
garments. Dispatch ! quick ! noble lady, for I 
must leave thee ; pursue thy way along the fo- 
rest, and thou mayest yet escape. A moment 
longer, and we are lost. Haste, haste thee then 
lady — give me thy clothes — we will bury them 
here — Away with thee, repent, and the holy Vir- 
gin wiU intercede for thee. 

*** Never!' answered Cora, laying her hand 


302 CLARA GAZUL. 

on her heart, * but protect my child, and so may 
God protect thee ;' and she darted into the thick- 
est part of the wood. 

'* * Stay lady, here is gold for thee,* exclaimed 
Battista, hastily pursuing her with a heavy purse 
of ducats, and he then vanished, making his way 
by a circuitous path to the palace. 

'* Let us now return to Belford, who, stunned 
and stupified, had been unable to arrest the steps 
of the murderess. 

" Antonia had tried to raise her dying eyes to- 
wards Heaven. * Father ! may my death be 
forgiven her— Holy Virgin! take my poor friend 
into thy holy keeping,*— said she, and the last words 
died away upon her lips. 

" She sunk an inanimate corpse, by the side of 
hirn she had loved, not wisely, but too well. 

** At sight of the blood flowing from the bosom 
of Antonia and of those sweet features on which 
death had just imprinted its fixed still character, 
the seat of reason fled, and Belford raved alter- 
nately calling wildly for the assassin who had 


CLARX GAZUr. 303 

murdered Antonia, and then on his knees, niiplo- 
ring the God of mercies to protect his poor 
wretched Cora. 

" Belford was shortly afterwards arrested and 
conveyed to prison heavily ironed, there to await 
his trial. 

" Antonia's mother was seized with an attack 
of apoplexy, at tlie sight of her murdered daugh- 
ter, and the sanje grave received their ashes. 


" It was in a village of North Wales, about ten 
}ears after the shocking assassination of Antonia, 
that the curiosity of a young Rnglish traveller, 
was strongly excited by the story which his land- 
lady related to him of a female who called herself 
Anna, having resided many years in or about the 
neighbourhood — She was supposed to be slightly 
deranged in her mind. 

" * Poor soul !' continued the talkative old wo- 
man, • I never shall forget the night of her arrival 


304 CLARA GAZUL. 

in these parts. Her dress was, I am told, in the 
foreign style. Alas! it was sadly tattered and 
torn, and her poor bare feet were bleeding at 
every pore ! My husband intreated her to come 
in and rest her weary bones, but she shook her 
head, placed a golden guinea in his hand, and 
asked for some straw to lay down upon. 

" * When we argued the point, she grew impa- 
tient, and wanted to leave us, nor has her dear 
head rested on a softer pillow, since she has re- 
sided amongst us, to be our guardian angel; nurs- 
ing our sick, and teaching our children to read 
and write, and sing and pray ; she is a mother to 
twenty fatherless orphans here, w hom she feeds 
and clothes, assisted by a good old neighbour, 
whom we have hired to watch her steps. 

" The Englishman, whose name was Bective, 
one evening followed the wild looking female 
which his landlady had been describing, as she 
bent her steps towards the little church. 

" The evening was chill, the wind blew sharp- 


CLARA GAZUL. 305 

ly and howled dismally among the few elm trees, 
which were thinly scattered around. 

'* Anna held a book in her hand, and paused 
occasionally, then hurried on as if in eager pur- 
suit of something. When she reached the church 
yard, she seated herself on a stone, and fixed her 
eyes on the clouds, as if to watch the gathering 
storm. Soon afterwards she threw them in that 
direction where a new grave was being filled up ; 
she then arose and proceeded to examine it close- 
ly, and stooped to pick up a scull, which she ap- 
peared to consider with intense curiosity, placing 
her fingers occasionally on her own temples, as if 
making comparisons. 

" A heavy shower of rain now bad fair to con- 
tinue with unabated violence, yet the poor soul 
appeared entirely insensible to its force, as it af- 
fected herself; but observing a feeble old crea- 
ture, bent double with age, she took her cloak 
from her shoulders, and threw it over the shiver- 
ing beggar. 

Vol. 11. R R 


306 CLARA GAZUL. 

" * No good lady, not so,' said the old woman, 
returning it. 

" * Silence!' exclaimed poor Anna, in a com- 
manding tone, * I feel no rain," added she, in a 
more conciliating voice, as she hastily passed her 
and seated herself on a rock at some distance. 
The lightning's glare now falling on her wild wan 
features, her beauty appeared scarce human, so 
stern, pale, and majestic. 

'* Bective approached her with awe. 
** • Pray pardon me, I do not address you for 
the purpose of prying into the cause of your sor- 
rows, they are secret — but it is a dreadful night, 
and I respectfully request permission to conduct 
you to some place of shelter. 

*• Anna smiled, and Bective earnestly hoped 
he might never witness such another smile. 

" • Anna/ said he,—' poor Anna! you have 
cured many a heart-ache here, and the distres- 
sed of this village will lose their best friend if 
you persist in thus exposing your health. 

I have travelled two thousand miles without 


CLARA GAZUL. 307 

shoes, neither was God my support for I had for- 
saken him/ said Anna. 

" * You are too ill too be fatigued with argu- 
ments/ replied the Englishman, or I could urge 
many ; but whatever thy errors may have 
been 

" * Errors! !' interrupted Anna, with a wild 
unnatural laugh. 

" * Nay then, thy crimes, poor soul, be they 
e'er so black, yet remember God hath more joy 
over one repenting sinner like thee 

** * Not so !* again, interrupted Anna, * not so— 
there never was an action of my life that I repent- 
ed of, or that 1 would not act over again' — her 
eyes flashed indignant fire, she struck her fore- 
head with her hand, and was hastening away. 

'* * Forgive me, poor Anna/ said the stranger, 
closely following her, * fain would I heal the sor- 
rows of thy heart! — May God comfort thee!' 

That flash of wild indignation which had 
brightened poor Anna's countenance, and tinged 


Ii08 CLARA GAZUL. 

her pale cheek, with the glowing beauty of times 
long gone bye, suddenly faded to a death-like 
hue. A single tear fell over her cheek, which 
she slowly brushed away with one of her thick 
dark locks of hair, as they waved in the wind. 

** * Stranger, I do believe you pity me,* said 
she, after a long pause, but I cannot converse. 
Require not impossibilities of such a wretch as 

I am — You can do me good.' She drew 

out a sealed parchment from her bosom. 

** * Swear to preserve that parcel unopened, till 
after my death — 'Tis my will.* 

'• * I do swear to fulfill all your wishes now 
and hereafter, siiould I survive you, to the extent 
of my abilities.' 

** * The thanks of a broken heart are all that I 
have to ofler,' said poor Anna, and tlien waved 
her hand despbndingly for him to depart. 

*' 'I'he stranger placed the will within his 
breast, and bidding her farewell, immediately 
proceeded on his journey. The image of Anna 


CLARA GAZUL. 309 

was ever afterwards in his mind ; and he spoke of 
her in all societies. 

'* Some time afterwards, he made the tour of 
Italy, and at Xaples, he often met Belford, who 
had been acquitted of the murder of Antonia, and 
now lived with his son in retirement. Ever con- 
sidering himself as the first cause of Cora's crime, 
he had never enjoyed a cheerful moment frona 
that hour. — For two years he had travelled over 
England, and had searched with indefatigable 
perseverance for some trace of his lost wife, and 
by this time it was generally believed that she 
had destroyed herself. 

" When Bective related the story of the poor 
recluse of North Wales, the truth flashed across 
his mind at once, and for the first time since the 
death of Antonia, a ray of hope glimmered in his 
soul. — * Ten years of penitence and good deeds 
have washed away a crime which was not pre- 
meditated,' said he. 

" * A momentary act of madness, though fatal 
mits consecjuences will not surely meet with ercr- 


310 CLARA GAZUL. 

nal punishment. I will speak peace to her poor 
broken heart, she shall sleep on my bosom and 
find comfort. We will join our prayers with such 
contrite hearts, that incense shall ascend to Hea- 
ven with those of the orphan and poor widow, 
whom her charity has comforted. I will place 
our blooming boy in her arms, and Cora will for- 
give me.* 

" They travelled with indefatigable sjjeed, and 
arrived just at the beginning of autumn, on a fine 
clear afternoon at the little Welsh inn, which 
Bective had remembered from his former visit to 
Wales, 

** In answer to their eager enquiries, they were 
informed by the landlady of the little inn, where 
Bective had formerly lodged, that poor Anna was 

dead that a month had elapsed since she was 

buried in the small rural church-yard, where 
Bective had seen her exposing her wasted frame 
to the pelting storm. And this day the bright 
sun shone out gaily over her grave ! * * 


CLAR\ GAZUL. 311 

•• A month elapsed after the fatal news had 
been thus abruptly related to him, before Belford 
summoned courage to ascertain the following 
particulars of poor Cora's death. 

" About three weeks after the departure of 
Bective, a cough had fixed itself on her lungs 
which was pronounced from the first to be incu- 
rable. To the last she had exerted herself to se- 
cure the comforts of the surrounding poor ; she 
begged them to seek out Mr. Bective as soon as 
she should be laid in the earth, who was in pos- 
session of her will, and she declared in the pre- 
sence of the curate and attorney of the village, 
that it was her last will, and related to the dispo- 
sal of the jewels she had about her person, and 
she affirmed it to have been written in tier perfect 
senses. The curate had vainly exhorted her to 
repentance and prayer. 

" *Grood man,* said the dying stranger impa- 
tiently, * I do not repent of the crime I have com- 
mitted 1 cannot. Shall I be a hypocrite, 

and say I do r' 


312 ciMnA nAZtJL. 

** The curate was deeply affected, h6 knew' not 
the nature of her crimes ; but suspected they had 
been of the blackest dye from some incoherent 
expressions which had escaped her lips. 

" She obstinately refused to see a c&tffilic 
priest, who resided in the neighbourhood. A 
few hours before her death at the suggestion of 
the landlady of the little Welsh inn, all her young 
scholars were assembled in their Sunday clothes 
around her couch, with the old and decrepid in- 
habitants who for ten years had lived on her 
bounty. 

" The children raised their little hands to 
Heaven and softly chaunted the beautiful sacred 
Italian melody which Anna had composed for 
them — The murmur of their young voices, added 
to her extreme stat^ of exhaustion lulled Cora — 
for it was indeed herself— into sweet tranquil 
slumber, such as she had never before enjoyed 
since Antonia*s death. 

" Those who had watched her sleeping, spoke 
in rapture of the bright but placid smile which 


CLARA GAZUL. 313 

played upon her dying lips and illumined her 
fine countenance when she awoke. 

" * I have slep't,' said Cora, * and in my 

dreams, I have heard sweet music* — — she 

paused and her countenance became fixed as in 
death. 

" * Do you repent of your crimes?' eagerly en- 
quired the priest, but Cora heard him not 

" Her poor heart had beat itself to rest."
