69 Vauxhall Bridge Road


I don't see how you, with your
high pride can refuse me the sum you
received from me after you had bestow'd
it on me – particularly as you knew my
generous motive for not accepting it
at the time.


My indignation expressed in many
letters is quite real and quite natural –
more I do swear to you that I considered your
conduct (in cutting me to attack a young
stupid Sister not half so handsome) with any
feeling short of strong resentment and disgust
you would not (if you know anything of human
nature) believe me – during three months
of severe painful illness I had time for
reflection – and with a good deal of benevolence
in my nature I could not but wish to think
of you with less bitterness and dislike. It
matter'd not to you, my opinion – but to
myself hate was feverish and a bore


the result of calm candid inward reasoning on
the subject brought me to this conclusion
I was vilely brought up, my nature was disguised; from
under the mask of profligacy, false pride, slyness
and bad habits – you never read my heart.
you thought me what false childish pride,
error in judgment, and taste made me
affect to be – could you have understood what
in truth was noble in my Character had you
known what really was the case – that H Wilson's
attachment for you would have been equal to
the sacrifice of her life a thousand times over
that neither age or poverty or any wretchedness
of yours, or future temptation falling in
any way, could have made me waiver in
my faith, supposing you had but told me
you wish'd me to be yours only – or that my
constancy could "make you happy". Perhaps,
(so I reflected) "if this men had known
The sterling natural steadiness of my
affections he would have felt some friendship
for me – If your conduct was profligate and 
fiendish as regards Sophia – if it was somewhat 
unfeeling as regarded. The pecuniary difficulties 
you left me to struggle with – while my health


and spirits were subdued by your
desertion – still it may be said in
extenuation – that my high spirit and
false pride were all exerted to blind
you and conceal from me my
distress's both of mind and pocket
you never understood me – let
me hope that if you had known me
well and truly, I should not have
had come to think so ill of you –


"We must forgive and forget in this
world" (so I addressed Fred Lamb lately).
You – (said I to Fred) had once ill acted
a selfish part by me which I resented
rather too strongly now shake hands

Fred Lamb with real good taste
did shake hands just before he left
England besides sending me a
more substantial proof of his
forgiveness and good will knowing
that if I was in a fiery passion
when I resented his treatment so
strongly and publicly that I was even then at least
as meek as a Lamb!!!" how when you
recollect that by same Lamb I was nearly
being **choaked** *pour vos beaux yeux*
rather than be unfaithful to you
 –

and that I returned you the money
you placed in my hands, depriving
myself of what I was distress'd for –
for fear you should miss it –
I will hope that the same Lord Ponsonby
who on receiving back my letters
was at least once on a time for a
moment spontaneously generous and
good (you brought me another long
kind letter – the amiable impulse was perfect
but – alas! – you stole the letter
back again from under my pillow
on second thoughts) – will now
render me the assistance
I am so much distres’d for
at least to the amount of

that sum which else he has accepted
from my charity and good will toward
him and his former poverty. It was hardly fair to leave
even a common acquaintance of
years without a guinea – and
I have never received one from
you since I return'd your last
donation – I leave it now to
your good feelings assuming
you in truth that much as
I have enjoy'd abusing you myself.
I never can endure to hear of
the Germans doing it, considering
myself the only privileged person
in that particular

yours Obediently
Harriette Rochfort

Mr Rochhort is abroad and I am (in my difficulties) alone at your mercy –
