Excerpt: ... Col. Rochfort's Improvement In Field Gun Carriages, etc.--Our readers will remember an article of some length that appeared lately in our columns upon the subject of an improvement in field gun carriages, by the substitution of iron for wood, proposed by Lieutenant Colonel William Henry Rochfort, formerly of the E. I. artillery service, but late and last of that of H. M. F. M. of Portugal. Since then we have ourselves seen both the plans and model, and in these days of economy and retrenchment, we de sire seriously to call the attention of the Board of Ordnance to this self evident amelioration. We observe also, that in addition to the improvements set forth by Lieutenant Colonel William Henry Rochfort, in our journal of the 21st February, the model which we have had under inspection presents a material alteration for the better as regards the trail handspike. This cumbrous and mouvement article as at present adapted, has to be shipped and tinshipped every time the gun limbers up for changing position, or goes into or out of action, by which means considerable time is lost. In the model before us, we notice that this is remedied by the substitution of a forceps iron branch terminating in a socket and staff, the traverse bolt of the trail-plates forming the axis of its motion, and the simple action of the hand up or down serving to bring it into position for action or for movement. We have had submitted to us several other improvements suggested by Colonel Rochfort for the ordnance and naval departments, amongst which we cannot but notice the great advantage that would result to our rocket service from the adoption of his ingenious but simple method for giving a more effectual and correct direction to the rocket, by the neutralization, in a great measure, ...

To the Editors of the United Service Gazette. 


GENTLEMEN: If the following remarks on the use of shells on 


ship-board are suitable for the columns of your journal, they are 
much at your service. 


I remain, gentlemen, 
Your very respectful and obedient servant, 


WILLIAM HENRY ROCHFORT. 
late Lieut. Colonel of Horse Artillery in the service of H. M. F. M. 
Donna Maria II, and formerly of the H. E. I. C’.s Artillery.

Ist. The hollow shot or shell to explode without fuze, etc., etc. 

The effect of a shell 13, 10, 8, or even 54 inch, bursting on board 
ship, is admitted by all naval men to be of the most tremendous 
and destructive order, and the great objection to the more general 
use of shells on ship-board, arises, in the first instance, from the 
danger of carrying loose or uncapped shells about, either between 
or upon deck, amidst the fire that lays and blows about in action, 
to which, in loading, the shell must necessarily be exposed, one 
single spark of such fire being sufficient to ignite the uncapped 
fuze, and cause consequent explosion on or between decks, as the 
case may be. 

A second, and scarcely less serious objection, is the inconveni- 
ent, very heavy, cumbersome ordnance from which a shell has to 
be projected, mortars generally excepted for the discharge of shrap- 
nells, which, however, I believe, are but very seldom used on ship- 
board. 

The impracticability of ranging this unwieldy ordnance, alter- 
nately or otherwise, with guns or carronades along the decks of our 
ships of war, is admitted. A kind of substitute for projecting large 
hollow shot has been adopted on board some of our men-of-war 
steamers, carrying 68 pounders; but the hollow shot so projected 
perform the office of shot only. They do not, indeed are not in- 
tended to, explode, and shells are not projected therefrom for rea- 
sons already assigned. 

To meet all these objections, I have invented a shell, which may 
be made to any diameter or calibre, and which shall explode, with- 
out fuze, upon striking the vessel or object with which it comes in 
collision. Hence disappears the danger of unexpected explosion 
from the fire blowing about in action igniting the fuze. 

It will immediately appear evident that to effect this J have re- 
sorted to percussion, and I am aware that the French artillerists

have been long seeking this grand desideratum, hitherto without 
success. Some of their ideas were exceedingly ingenious, although, 
I must say, and I certainly say it with no disrespectful feeling, pue- 
rile. One, indeed, shown me by Colonel Barbe, at the Minister 
of Marine’s, although, as I have said, ingenious, reminded me of 
that child’s plaything, cup and ball, rather than of a machine for 
the extermination of mankind. 

Capt. Norton’s rifle-shell answers for detonating purposes very 
well at such ranges up to which the front of his shell is preserved, 
to effect which it is necessary to groove or rifle both the shell, which 
is of oblong form, nét round, and the cylinder through which the 
shell is propelled, in order to obtain a spiral instead of a rotary 
motion for the shell through the air, and which latter motion is na- 
tural to the projectile. 

The inconvenience and expense, if not the impracticability, of 
grooving shells and ordnance, are evident; and if neither such in- 
convenience, expense, or impracticability existed, yet would the 
great object remain unattained: for from even a groeved cylinder 
a projectile will preserve its front only fora very short distance.— 
I believe Captain Norton grooved a three-pounder, and that the 
shells discharged therefrom preserved their front and exploded at 
a distance of from two hundred and fifty to three hundred yards, 
the percussion copper-cap in all instances occupying the place and 
doing the duty of a fuze. Captain Norton’s rifle shells would an- 
swer, I should imagine, for blowing up ammunition wagons on the 
line of march, that were not so well, and less proof, constructed 
than our own; but as it is preferable always to capture rather than 
destroy, where it is possible, I should not think they would be al- 
ways in requisition. A few rifle-flankers, so provided for an emer~ 
gency, might no doubt be advantageous, but these shells have no 
analogy whatever with the shell of my construction. 

It must not be imagined that there is difficulty in contriving a 
shell, which, by being forcibly propelled against a hard substance, 
such as a ship’s side, shall explode. The difficulty does not lay 
here, but exists, first, in the so contriving the shell, if to explode 
by copper-cap percussion upon the RIFLE-SHELL principle, that it 
shall, upon being discharged out of any gun or cylinder, not groov- 
ed or rifled, preserve its front always to any, no matter what, dis- 
tance of its range. 

Now to effect this—it would be: necessary, as in Captain Nor- 
ton’s case, to subvert one of the fundamental laws of motion, or, 
indeed, of nature; I have therefore preferred propitiating or yield- 
ing to nature, and the law therefrom arising, rather than combat 
so powerful an antagonist. I leave, therefore, the projectile, or 
shell—to all appearance an ordinary round shot, (of whatever 
diameter it may be, ) to take its natural course and motion rotato- 
ry through the air. Instead of an oblong grooved shot or shell, to 
fit a grooved or rifle cylinder, as I have described the rifle-shells 
to be, my shell is round; and, as I have said, apparently an ordi- 
nary round shot; the ordnance from which it is to be projected

is any ordnance now in use, whether howitzer, gun, or carronade. 

The next difficulty to be surmounted is, to insure that although 
the shell shall explode upon contact or collision with a substance, 
such as a ship’s side, yet that it shall not explode from the propel- 
ling power or impetus given to it by the charge of powder in the 
gun from which it is discharged. 

It appeared strange to me to hear the French artillerists, who 
are certain'y by no means inferior to our own in science, declare 
that they had no means whereby to regulate the resistance of these 
comparative shocks, viz. Ist, the shock or shot upon leaving its 
ordnance; 2d, the shock or shot’s impingment upon point of im- 
pact or ship’s side. 

The first of these shocks comprises three resistances, viz: the 
impetus itself given to shock—the friction of shot through chase 
of ordnance—the resistance of air. 

The second shock is confined to one resistance only, viz: im- 
pingement upon place of impact on ship’s side. 

Now, the impetus and friction of shot through cylinder, ex- 
pressed in the first instance, will depend, or rather vary, according 
to charge of powder; and, again, the resistance of air to balls of 
equal velocities, being nearly i in the ratio of their squared diame- 
ters, will vary also, according to charge of powder directly. 

But the resistance of impingment upon a ship’s side is equal to 
the resistance of so much solidity of timber, (quality,) as ship’s 
side represents, being an immoveable plane meeting a perfectly 
hard body, impelled with the impetus with which it is projected 
through the air, and this principle is the law of nature and motion, 
that reaction is equal to action, and in a contrary direction. 

In the first instance, therefore, we find the impetus communi- 
cated to projectile met only by the friction of cylinder and resis- 
tance of air. Now the friction of any shot through its cylinder 
has not been determined ; and this friction dependant upon wind- 
age, is of two sorts, superior and ipferior—above and below; the 
friction above being as three to nineteen below, when the gun is 
at point blank, or at no elevation. 

But as the two frictions never occur simultaneously, and as the 
friction above is considerably less frequent in its occurence than 
below, the above proportion will not serve for data, and especially 
because the upper and lower friction is variable, and the one be- 
comes more or less so according to increased or depressed eleva- 
tion of ordnance. 

But if we take the friction of shot generally at point-blank to be 
about that of steam-carriages, viz., 1-240th of their weight, we 
shall approximate to the truth; and if we multiply this result by 
the impetus to be given to projectile, we shall arrive at nearly the 
quantity of friction of shot over an ordinary cylinder of six feet 
and a half. 

The shell, therefore, must be so constructed, in the first in- 
stance, that its detonating power shall be capable of resisting this 
shock of impetus and friction.

Now, it will appear evident that such shock can never amount 
to any thing like the shock of shot impinged upon point of im- 
pact about two feet thick of solid timber, such as is about the thick- 
nes of a line-of-battle-ship’s timbers. 

By the law of nature and motion, action and reaction being 
equal, but in a contrary direction, the shock of two feet thick of 
timber would be the impetus of projectile force, multiplied by the 
resistance of timber, multiplied by the weight of shot. 

A comparison of results will immediately slow the difference 
of two shocks, and how much the force or pressure from within, 
requisite to sustain the shock or pressure from without, is naturally 
less in the first instance than in the last. 

The rods, therefore, of my detonating shell, together with the 
thickness of circumference metal, are not required to be anything 
like so proof to withstand the first, as to withstand the second 
shock. But we donot desire to withstand the second shock ; we 
desire, on the contrary, to explode, and it must be evident to the 
most ordinary understandings that a proportionate power of resis- 
tance being given to the rods, or thickness of shell, will enable 
them to overcome the one and explode upon the other. 


CommunicaTine LoncirupE at sEA.—Lieutenant Liddell, R. 
N., of the East India ship Wellington, has published a suggestion 
that ships should always signalize their Greenwich time instead of 
their longitude. ‘Let there be inserted, (says he ) among the ge- 
neral signals these additional ones: ‘What is your Greenwich 
time? And ‘ My Greenwhich time is,’ with this explanatory note. 
‘The ship answering or making the signal will hoist at the mizen, 
or wherever it may be best seen, the ensign made up ina ball, and 
in a minute after, will dip it; the moment of dipping being rated 
by the chronometers on board the different ships.’ The signal for 
Greenwich time will immediately follow, ( omitting the hours, ) and 
the dipping of the ensign can be repeated, if any doubt exist. It 
is evident that this method will obviate the necessity of any calcu- 
lation, and be quite free from the errors often attending it. To 
prove the advantage which must often result from this plan, it may 
be as well to mention a case of frequent occurrence, similar to 
many I have myself witnessed within the last few years. Let us 
suppose a homeward bound vessel should meet a ship which had 
left England a week previously, and having been thick weather, the 
outward bound had had no observation for latitude for some days. 
It is clear that this ship could afford the other little or no service 
by giving her longitude by chronometer, as a wrong assumed lati- 
tude, in calculating for time, might cause an error of more than a 
degree, while, on the other hand, by giving the Greenwich time, 
the homeward bound vessel would in all probability be put within a 
mile of the truth.’ This suggestion appears to us to be worthy 
of universal adoption.—United Service Gazette.
