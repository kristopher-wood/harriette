# [Rochfort (Drumman and Sidebrook)](https://landedestates.ie/estate/4306)

Other branches of the Rochfort family held land in county Westmeath besides the Earl of Belvedere at the time of Griffith's Valuation (publ. 1854), including William Henry Rochfort who was descended from William Rochfort of Clontarf, county Dublin, a younger brother of the 1st Earl and his wife Henrietta Ramsay. William H Rochfort, born in 1795, had an interest in the lands of Drumman, 2,614 acres in the parish of Castlelost. However he was a spendthrift and womanizer and spent time in Fleet Street Prison due to the non-payment of his debts. Griffith's Valuation records Drumman as being in the hands of the Court of Chancery as there was a legal case pending between William H Rochfort and his mother Mrs Brown. His assignees and others, including his son Rajphoot Runjheet Rochfort (a minor), were advertising the sale of Drumman in the Encumbered Estates Court in July 1857, with a fee farm rent out of Brannockstown or Bellfield in the parish of Enniscoffey. Another branch of this family appear to have lived at Sidebrook, parish of Castlelost. There is reference to George Rochfort of Sidebrook's will 1786 in the list of Prerogative Wills. John Rochford of Sidebrook died in 1828. At the time of Griffith's Valuation John Rochfort held a sizable portion of the 1,804 townland of Farthingstown from 'Cooper' \[Cowper\] Rochfort. In 1876 Robert Rochford of Sidebrook owned 815 acres in county Westmeath. The Irish Law Times of 4 December 1886, 574, refers to the bankruptcy of Eliza Rochford of Sidebrook, widow.
