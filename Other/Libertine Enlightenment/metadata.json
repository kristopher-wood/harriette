  "content_summary": "This chapter explores Harriette Wilson’s Memoirs as a unique case of early 19th-century libertine authorship. Lisa O’Connell frames Wilson’s text as a pioneering fusion of celebrity, scandal, and commerce, whereby a woman reclaims control over her narrative and capitalizes on her own sexual notoriety. The essay investigates Wilson’s use of threats and revelations in her publication strategy, her subversion of male libertine models, and the ambivalent cultural reception of her literary aspirations. It situates Wilson’s Memoirs within the broader Enlightenment discourse on liberty, gender, and public identity."
