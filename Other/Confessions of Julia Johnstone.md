## INTRODUCTION.
Why does she publish---is a very natural question, and very easily answered- because I have a character to vindicate, and a great regard for my friends. Since the appearance of that scandalous work, "Harriette Wilson's Memoirs," I have suffered much by my own reflections and those of my friends: she has calumniated me whenever she has mentioned my name, and appears to delight in reducing all to her own disgusting level. Though I have fallen, it is not certainly beneath my own good opinion, nor am I so lost as to despise the censure, or be indifferent to the approbation of the wise and the good.

I have, thank heaven, many, many friends, with whom it is my interest and inclination to be upon good terms they have entreated me, nay, demanded of me , as a duty I owe to those who notice me , that I clear myself from Harriette Wilson's vile aspersions. I hasten to do so without any qualification for an Authoress, but a resolution to speak truth, even though it militate against myself. I am not under a single obligation to Harriette Wilson; on the contrary, she is indebted to me not only for pecuniary services, but introducing her into fashionable life, before I was thoroughly acquainted with the baseness of her principles: -- I deeply lament having done so. With almost every person she has so wantonly libelled, I am personally acquainted, and with several of them on the most intimate terms of friendship. I am not so selfish as to intend rescuing myself alone from the fangs of this destroyer; in fact, I cannot clear my own character from reproach, without clearing my friends also, who are equally mis-represented with myself; and numbers of them, now doing honor to exalted stations, have laid me under strong obligations of gratitude; however my feelings shall never overpower my impartiality, nor shall the tenderest ties cause me to swerve from truth.

In my Confessions, I must of necessity expose my own errors and frailties; let no one suppose me forward by so doing --I cannot effect my object, and hide a single shade in the Picture; --my sins have not been manifold, and would have been much less, had I never known "The betrayer of secrets and vilifier of friends." The character of her who wrote, and him who published her Memoirs, are about upon a par: the one has been long used to think indelicately, and the other has for years been a hacknied vender in obscenity.

To break through every tie of common honesty to blazon the sacred intercourses of love and friendship; ―to degrade the true nobility, and descend to extort money by threats of exposure, are deeds, which only such a "worthy pair" would have meditated and attempted.

I write from the purest motives, to rescue my sex from unqualified infamy, and to do justice to the other. There are few Harriette Wilsons amongst us; the most unfortunate of us have the strongest feelings of gratitude - I will give proofs of it as I proceed in my undertaking.

My Book may restore peace into the bosom of many families, from whence it has been driven by the Demon of Discord; - if one Mother speaks of me with thankfulness if one Child lisps my name with pleasure and one Father says I have done him an act of justice, I shall not think my labour bestowed in vain.

I have no more to say, by way of Introduction - in fact, my book will be a series of Introductions to the real characters whose shadows Harriette Wilson has been displaying in the camera obscura of her distorted imagination: -let the Reader compare both Portraits, as drawn by myself and that lady; I flatter my hopes that the touches of nature will be found in the work of JULIA JOHNSTONE.

London, March 12th, 1825.

# CONFESSIONS OF JULIA JOHNSTONE, RELATIVE TO HERSELF AND OTHERS.

*"On eagle's wings immortal scandals fly,
Whilst virtuous actions are but born and die."*
    - EARL OF CORK .

HEIGH OH! not for a husband - heaven knows I have had more than my share of them in this world already. Heigh oh; was a favourite ejaculation of my mother's, when in a deep study, whether to proceed direct to a certain point, so that every person might see her actions, or take a circumbendibus where she could mark the proceedings of others , and shew herself as much or as little as she thought proper. I leave the circumbendibus route to those who have reason to be ashamed of their proceedings, and take unceremoniously the direct line at first , to continue it through all my future operations.

I shall dispose of my family very briefly, as they disposed of their Julia in her early days . My mother was an honourable lady by birth, and also by creation; for she was one of the maids of honour to her Majesty Queen Charlotte, mother of our present beloved Sovereign. The place was one more of distinction than emolument - my mother never took more than her stated salary, which was very trifling for so high an office. The tales of parting her Majesty's cast-off clothes amongst the maids of honour, were very true - I began early to figure in the robes of Royalty - our family were not rich; my father I never saw he died abroad in embarrassed circumstances - it was a love match betwixt him and my mother - like all early love - matches, it proved unhappy. My father most cruelly - but, no matter - at least it is no matter to the public - and over a parent's errors , however greatly a child may have suffered from them, she is bound to draw the veil of Christian charity. My mother could not well afford to educate me at home in a style becoming her name and lofty station. The Queen's German school was open to all her servants, but pride kept me from it; an obscure boarding-school near Eton, was where I made my first essay to learn -- from that I was suddenly removed to a Convent in the South of France; the Lady Abbess of which was an English woman, a descendant of the unfortunate Stewart family; she had no religious prejudices, and paid no attention to her boarders, — their morals and education were alike neglected. I had capacity and industry; I learnt to read novels, dance with elegance and grace, - to play tolerably on various instruments, and dream of love when I knew of it no more than the name. I was accounted handsome, and thought myself beautiful; at the age of thirteen I was sent for home, and arrived at the Royal Palace (where my mother had apartments) to finish my education under an old ignorant Swiss governante, amidst gloomy walls, and long avenues of trees, sufficient to horrify one at my age, and of my temperament.

My mother possessed all the starched and stately manners of the old Anglo-Germanic school, and I was no companion for her. Once she introduced me to her Majesty, who received me with a sort of compassionate kindness, patted my head, told me to be a good girl, and learn to speak German, when she would make my fortune. My mother now provided me with a German governess, a poor and proud descendant of the Schwellenberg family. I was very idle, not even the royal promise of making my fortune could make me attend to German. "What a fortune is my mother's, (said I,) such a one will never do for me; I am for freedom and independence." My governess complained, my mother scolded, I pouted, a carriage was drawn up to the palace-gates, I entered it by word of command, put my head out of the window, "Good bye, mother," "Adieu, daughter," away went the horses full speed, and from that moment we never met again.

I had no reason to respect my mother: she never gave me any reason to believe she loved me. I thought only of where I was going, and the new finery packed up for my use. We stopped at the Palace of Hampton-Court. Another palace, thought I, pray heaven it prove less gloomy than the one I have turned my back upon, and grant me to find a few male and female friends about my own age, for I had never been able to form a single friendship, and scarcely an acquaintance, whilst under my mother's roof.

I was handed out of the carriage by a military officer; the sight inspired me with unusual pleasure; a hussar's cap and feather gives such a fillip to the spirits of a young miss in her teens, you don't know. In a very elegant drawing-room I found a lady of a superior cast, looking sour as a crab, and surrounded by a family of smiling young cherubs.

She welcomed me pompously, and said I was to remain with her, to complete my education along with her daughters. The children appeared delighted, and so was I, though the duenna looks of Mrs. Cotton (for such was her name) made me freeze: in about an hour, Colonel Cotton was announced, a tall handsome man, below the middle age, advanced and took me by the hand. I was surprised to find that he and I were old acquaintances. He had called upon me at the convent in France with letters from my mother, and once or twice chaperoned me about the town. As a child, I then admired him, and now, placed under his protection, soon accustomed myself to look up to him as a parent, for natural protector I had none, and a juvenile mind anxiously wishes for some fond breast on which it can repose all its little dreams of sorrow, and visions of joy.

The austerity of Mrs. Cotton's temper and repulsive manner kept me much from her presence. I was not engaged more than two hours per day in my studies, and the children were too young for me to associate with. The Colonel undertook to squire me to public places, such as the Opera and British Theatres. To balls and concerts I could not go without a female usher, and very seldom had Mrs. Cotton leisure to take me under her protection.

Fate thus threw me into the arms of the Colonel, who was a very gallant man, He lived on the worst possible terms with his wife, and on that account saw but little company at home. At the early age of sixteen I fell a victim to my own inexperience, and the impassioned solicitations of a man, one of the handsomest and most accomplished of the age. Let no one condemn me, who has not been placed in a similar situation; neglected from my childhood bythose who ought to have nurtured my infant mind; abandoned to the care of strangers at the most critical period of a young girl's existence; with a warm and grateful heart; and passions, though not wild as the wave, certainly too strong for me to keep under control without the advice of a friendly monitor - I must have been more than mortal to have withstood temptation.

It was not without many compunctious visitings of conscience, that I fell from the eminence of virtue; I was truly sensible of the value of all I had lost; but my gratitude was raised to such a fervent pitch, that I really believed - nay, I was most seriously in love with the Colonel and he with me.

When I discovered myself to be in a peculiar situation, the Colonel removed me to a cottage near Primrose Hill, where I had all the conveniencies and comforts of life , if not the elegancies -

"The fields my study, Nature was my book."

The Colonel visited me as often as he could be spared from his regimental duties, and altogether I was more than tolerably happy. And now for Miss Harriette Wilson; how do you do, my old acquaintance? Do not be in one of your usual assumed frights and real passions - they won't do with me, who know you; and really I mean to treat you with more tenderness than you merit; that is, to expose your falsehoods in as genteel a manner as possible, and hold you up to public scorn in a decent way, with all your "blushing honours" thick upon you.

Firstly, as to your original introduction to me, there is not a tittle of truth in the account you give; you say, we met and spoke during a walk, and I invited you to dine at my cottage on the same day! A very romantic unaccountably well got up tale, that I, whom you say had not spoken to any body but my servants for four years, and was the mother of five children, should at one glance of your basilisk features, throw aside years of discretion and maternal retirement, and plunge into familiarity with a heedless and giddy girl, whose face was as familiar to all in the streets as a bill of the play or the walking advertisement of a lottery-office.

The fact was, that Col. Cotton being introduced to you by poor Tom Sheridan, he brought you both home to dinner one Sunday, and thus really commenced our first acquaintance. I do not deny that I was actually fascinated with your lovely features and arch vivacity; and, as the Colonel told me you had never made a faux pas with any other than Frederick Lamb, whose name you then bore, I imagined your case and my own to be very similar, and became sympathetically attached to your fate.

To do you justice you returned my affection with corresponding warmth, and took care seldom to suffer me to be alone for one day. It was years before I found out the duplicity and selfish heart of Miss Harriette Wilson.

She says, "my heart was cold." - Would to heaven it had been so; I should not now so warmly feel those injuries received by me at her hands.

The story of my being seized with labour when in the act of paying my respects to her Majesty at Court is as ridiculous as indelicate, and revolting to human nature. Then it was the fashion to wear stays so straight-laced, that the waists were reduced to the shape and size of a small funnel - it would have been impossible to conceal an increase of size during eight months under such a torturing mode of dress. I never saw her Majesty but once as I have related, and never was at Court during my whole life.

Mrs. Cotton never behaved to me as Miss Wilson falsely describes ;-she knew not of my intimacy with the Colonel for many, many months, after I had left her house, and before that she had ceased to live with her husband, an event I had no hand in bringing to pass, and for which my conscience does not reproach me . In page 35 of her Memoirs, Miss Wilson observes at length upon the rage of my mother and brother in quite a dramatic style - not a scene of it is true. My mother received the news of my disaster with the greatest apathy, and contented herself with writing me a note to say, I must expect no further assistance, but live upon my own small fortune of £4000 left me by a relation. My brother was at the time abroad, consequently the duel was an imaginary one of Miss Wilson. And here I cannot avoid remarking how very apropos the old saying is to that lady; it is somewhat vulgar, but it is therefore suitable to my subject, "Liars should be provided with good memories." She writes that I found
means, through Colonel Thomas, to threaten Col. Cotton with destroying myself! I have drank of cup of love to the very the dregs, but never was so overcome by its intoxicating qualities as to think of destroying myself. This Col. Thomas, who has long ago shot himself, was intimate with us at Primrose-cottage ; he was a fine young man, but apt to be wild and rambling, on account of a severe wound in his head. Harriette feigned a great attachment to his person, and he believed in her sincerity. She once wished to make Frederick Lamb jealous, and persuaded Thomas to write her a letter as if it had come from the Prince of Wales, in reply to one she had written to that illustrious Personage. Thomas was for a time a sort of supernumerary secretary to the Prince, and the stratagem succeeded. Frederick Lamb swore, stormed, but finally made it up, by presenting his chere amie with two hundred pounds!

I did not know of this piece of treachery till Thomas's death, five years afterwards. Unfortunately, Miss Wilson has published the above fiction as a reality, and laid the scene when she was under Lord Craven's protection. Ne importé; any thing that is readable is pardonable in a work of fiction.

I have no patience with Miss Wilson when her falsehoods are of a nature to do most serious injury to the good name or fame of any individual. She writes thus, "Cotton was dismissed from his regiment by his Royal Commander." The paragraph, where this is brought in, is so dexterously worded as to induce the Reader to believe that the Colonel was dismissed [from] the service in consequence of his estrangement from his wife, and his attachment to me. There never was a more cruelly false insinuation. I believe military law takes no cognizance of errors of the heart in any of its officers, and unfortunately there is no law, human at least, which punishes those who rend the dearest bosom ties asunder, trample on the honorable mind, and bring the tears of sensibility from an already broken and sorrowful heart.

Colonel Cotton is still in His Majesty's service, with a reputation not to be shaken by the calumnies of a despicable ------ any thing you like, for the creature is really below contempt.

If any remembrance of good deeds existed in that woman's bosom, I would remind her when her friend left her almost pennyless for a month, and the Duke of Argyle, in return to an application she made for fifty pounds, folded her letter inside out. and sent it back unsealed, inclosing a five pound note, with these lines written in red ink: -

"HARRY - Get your Fifty Pounds from those on whom you have conferred as many favors - you have never conferred anything on me for which the inclosure will not be to
the amount of value received, by

Your obedient,
A. B. C."

Now it is probable that Miss Wilson may recollect who relieved her embarrassments, and divided betwixt her and me his last hundred; if she has (and her publisher boasts that betwixt them they have fingered £10,000 of the public money,) made such a fortune by the circulation of slander, it would wipe away one of her sins, that of ingratitude, were she to pay the Colonel what she owes him. He is now in Paris, and not far from where she pretends to reside.

I have long ago parted, no more to engage with the Colonel; so that I am advocating his cause from no interested motives - nay, probably I am foolishly doing a friendly act to one who laid the foundation of all my misfortunes, and has since treated me with an indifference bordering on inhumanity; but I will be just to the last word, and the last penny I have to spare.

One word more and I have for the present done with self - Harriette never saw a letter from the Colonel to me in her life, for the very best reason in the world — he never wrote me a single line from the time we went to Primrose-cottage till we parted; and when that event happened, Miss Wilson and myself had become strangers to each other.

Now remember, Reader, I am supposed to be vegetating on Primrose Hill, and to beguile the time whilst my own future personal Confessions are in embryo - I will turn to the first page of Miss Harriette Wilson's book, and proceed to unravel a portion of her most strange eventful history.

Memoirs - ah; such memoirs, divest them of falsehoods, and the whole might be written on a thread-paper.

But I had nearly forgot my resolution at the commencement of this; to proceed in a straight line, so I must say a very little on Miss Wilson's birth, parentage, and education, or, which amounts to the same thing - she shall say it herself. We were as friendly as two sisters, and every evening when Fred Lamb left her alone, which was four out of six, she came to me, danced to my music, or romped with the children; she was all animal spirits, I believe nothing could have made her grave for an hour, but the loss of her beauty.

I had never inquired into her history; naturally I am very uninquisitive. Lord Alvanley once said, and truly, “By heavens! You are either something better or worse than a woman, for you want that which forms a necessary part of their existence - curiosity."

"I can be curious where I have a right , (said I,) and where I have not , I am ill-qualified to act the part of the busy body.

One Sunday, Mr. Johnstone , alias the Colonel, had not visited me-Fred. Lamb always dined at home on that day like a good boy, we had no music and were rather dull, - " Come Julia," said Harriette, "I will dispel this ennui by telling you my history."

"As you please," said I, and thus she began, "How many lovers do you suppose I have had? None but my lambkin; oh, you're widely mistaken; let me see," holding up and counting her fingers, --- "one, two, three, four."

"For heaven's sake stop," I exclaimed, you cannot be serious; never more so in my life;" was the quick reply. "My sister; but I am getting on too fast, - my mother, had a large family of us, all very handsome, but none to compare with myself; my father had only a Captain's commission to support the whole of us upon, but he gained many friends, and some great fools educated us all for charity's sake. I kept at one boarding school or another till my fourteenth year; when I returned home our residence was a small house in a nook at Hammersmith, where we burrowed together like so mmaannyy rraabbbbiittss. My beauty soon became talked of in the neighbourhood, and a young man, who taught music at a ladies boarding-school on the Terrace , paid me particular attention; he would have had the honour and pleasure of being my first seducer, but for his timidity. The son of our washerwoman kept a wherry on the river and plied for hire; he was a strong in kneed fellow, with red hair and rosy cheeks, and the finest set of teeth I ever saw; with my sister Amy I often took trips to Isleworth and back, where she went to visit her lover, a miller, long celebrated for intrigues in his low way, by the bye, his wife got jealous and made an incision in her throat, which effectually cured her, for when she recovered, Amy was often invited by her to the mill for days, to keep her husband in good humour.

Whilst Amy went to meet her dusty miller, I wandered into fruit and pastry-cook's shops for refreshment, and at last for amusement, made love to the young waterman; what began in jest ended in earnest; we were as happy as hearts could be in a few days. "Can this be true?" interrupted I. "True as eggs are eggs;" cried Harriette. "To be sure there was not much sentiment on either side, but we were seriously in love for seven long weeks, when I fell sick for a Recruiting-Serjeant, who beat such a tattoo on my heart, he fairly turned it topsy turvy. I made up a bundle and eloped with him in the Hammersmith stage to Westminster; there he deserted both me and his regiment, taking with him all my best clothes, watch, and money. This cooled me of love in low life; I returned home, resolved to hold my head higher in my future crusades against mankind. 

My mother received me as well as could be expected; so that she had not the expence of keeping us she cared not how or where we were employed. My sister Amy, in her walks about Hammersmith, met a gentleman of some wealth, and eccentric habits; she determined to never more think of the mill,' and eloped with old Testy; he was an author, a wit, and a man of fashion; he shared his caresses betwixt Amy and his lap-dog, and in process of time I was invited to spend a few weeks in the winter with Amy, at her residence on Sloane-terrace, where he kept her in style; carriage --- servants --- black boy , &c. &c. This was a new scene to me. Operas, balls , and plays danced like meteors before my giddy eyes, and 1 fancied myself the goddess of every man's adoration.

"Amongst the ton who spent their evenings with us were Capt. Sir Peter Parker, of the Royal Navy, the handsomest man I had then ever seen, Lieutenant-General Brock, and Lord Craven. I admired all three of these notables: I gave my love to the first, my respects to the second, and accepted of protection from the third; they were at one time all ready to fight for me ; but Craven had my interest most at heart.

"I had carefully concealed my little levities with the waterman and recruiting-serjeant; Craven verily believed me unpolluted, and to save me from worse consequences, took me all to himself, and hurried me away to Greenwich, where he had a snug and elegant retreat; here he "Fought all his battles o'er again," and I was tolerably happy, till chance threw Frederick Lamb in my way-fond of change-he made an impression on my heart-and oh! my dear Julia, one night Lord Craven, after a sound lecture, and presenting me with a check for two hundred pounds, ordered me out of his house, into a postchaise at the door, and telling me to order the postillion where to drive, shut the door, and shut me out of all place in his heart for ever. I soon found myself at the British Hotel in Cockspur-street, whence I sent for Frederick Lamb --- he flew to me on the wings of love, and that night we occupied furnished lodgings in Jermyn-street. The next morning". -here the door of our apartment was thrown open, and sans ceremonie, in walked the subject of our conversation, Frederick Lamb, bootel and spurred, who broke up a conversation never afterwards seriously resumed.

I have related this story nearly in the very ram bling words of Miss Wilson, and there is no part of it which she can with truth deny. When they left me for the night, I began to ruminate on all had heard, and at last became firmly persuaded that nearly all Harriette's tale was the issue of her own fertile brain, intended to amuse me. I had often witnessed her talent at story making, in order to divert a company, and I thought no more of what had passed, than of any other nonsense I had heard her utter before.

With Sir Peter Parker and General Brock I was personally acquainted; the latter , no doubt, had a fatherly feeling for the young lady, and Parker, who was then only a Lieutenant, though nephew and heir to the titles and fortunes of two Admirals, meant no more, as he afterwards confessed to me, than a flirtation with a pretty girl to recruit his spirits after a long cruise.

Both these worthies were slain in America, gallantly leading their men on to glory , and my ever to be lamented friend, Lord Byron, twined a wreath of never fading laurel over the seamen's grave. According to the above account, which I avow to be true, the merry-makings in Miss Wilson's memoirs are at the very commencement false; ashamed to own her failings before her connection with Lord Craven, I have done her justice, and entered her upon the stage of London life, not so abruptly nor so respectably as she herself has done in her book: mine is a plain tale, --- I have no hacknied editor, like Stockdale to wrap up in equivocal language, the most sensual tales, and clothe vice in the raiment of virtue. My mother-wit is not much, and to that I trust for security as my finger ends glide along the paper.

In Miss Wilson's first paragraph, she states many points, and leaves the reader to guess which was the one that made her the mistress of Lord Craven; to use her own words, "'twas the depravity of her own heart." As to her residence on the Marine Parade, at Brighton, it is all a fudge. About six months after I had a first quarrel with Miss Wilson, I met Lord Craven at the Opera, and having told him what I had heard about him and Miss Wilson --- I concluded by urging him to tell me whether there was any truth in her narration.

"As much," replied he, "as she can put into any thing, she prevailed upon me to take her under my protection from Sloane-street, by a fictitious tale of being turned out of her mother's house, and solicited by her sister Amy to submit to the embraces of an old gentleman in the neighbourhood; and, my dear Julia , (added his lordship very heartily laughing,) she forgot to say that her sudden dismissal from my cottage at Greenwich was because I caught her on the knee of my black footman, Mungo, and I bundled black and white, into the coach together to seek their fortunes.”

"Can this be real fact, my Lord?"

"Truth, upon my honor; the jade has no heart, and whoever has any thing to do with her, will have cause to repent. To gratify her passions, she will descend to any degradation, and to acquire money to lavish on her low paramours, she would sell the interest of her dearest friend."

I did not entirely acquiesce in this severe opinion, though I doubted not the sincerity of his lordship; and am so well acquainted with his generosity and goodness of heart, that I am certain any woman of common sense might have been happy with him; but Harriette Wilson bad scarcely common sense to use, and unfortunately she thought herself learned - indeed, she was a perfect bluestocking in her conversation; she scrawled over verses (you shall have a specimen of them by and bye) spouted Shakespeare, and once wrote a farce, which she submitted to the critical judgement of the late John Kemble. I was with her at the interview, when she went to receive back her manuscript; in my humble opinion it is worth relating.

We were ushered into the Manager's library at his house in Great Russel-street : he received us in his morning-gown and slippers. "Ladies, excuse me," said John, "for receiving you in this disarranged room of literature,"

"Oh," exclaimed Harriette, "Sir, I'm sadly afraid you'll think me impertinent, and my farce not worth a farthing."

"To you, madam, it may be worth many farthings -- to me, I'm afraid it would not take-that is to say, it is too serious for the Public."

"Serious! good Lord deliver me."

"Yes, madam; this is a laughing age; monkeys and buffoons take better than tragic and comic performers; your farce is too good; make it a serious comedy, and we'll give it a trial."

"I wish," said Harriette, "Charles Lamb was at the devil; Fred got him to correct my farce, as he is an author; he actually scratched out a whole act, and put in twenty speeches of his own; aye, aye, he made a spoiled child of my bantling."

"Your child, madam," said John Kemble, "is a promising one; but let me advise you to rear it yourself, and put it no more out to nurse, even though it be to lay on the bosom of a *Lamb*. Lamb writes very limping verses and runaway prose; illumine your pages with the reflection of your own mind, as you do me now by the light of your beautiful countenance, and you will make a very excellent comedy."

So saying, he handed over the manuscript, and Harriette tript away quite delighted with John's flattery; I easily saw, this was only a polite way of getting rid of the thing altogether.

1 forget the title of the piece, but remember well that it was made a farce of at last , which was hissed off the stage the first night.

The friendship I formed with Miss Wilson made us perfect inseparables; it was not the stinginess of Fred Lamb which offended Harriette; her extravagance knew no bounds; I am certain, at Somers' Town, he paid her a £100 per month, besides discharging all her milliner's and mantua-maker's bills at Christmas. She threw away guineas as I would pence, yet, compared to her, I was in affluent circumstances ; her extravagance caused a good deal of bickering, and at last completely disgusted Lamb.

She borrowed three hundred pounds from old Courtois, the hair-dresser; he was a rank old debauchee, and once before she had, in jewels, from him more than eight hundred pounds in value.

I went with her to settle the business, as he threatened to arrest her ; they retired into a room adjoining the drawing-room, and remained absent a full hour, when they rejoined me; the old miser was all smiles; kissed her hand repeatedly, and called her " very kind,-very pretty." How they had settled the account I feared to inquire , but never heard it mentioned afterwards; people can judge for themselves.

The last three hundred pounds were, however, peremptorily demanded by Courtois, and, after many times being put off, he applied to Frederick Lamb, who paid the debt and abandoned the borrower to some other less easily imposed upon.

The story of Lord Melbourne becoming the pander to his son was thus ---

Frederick Lamb was a sad dog among the ladies, and his family had in vain striven to reclaim him from excesses which were rapidly impairing his constitution; they had heard of his connection with Miss Wilson, and Lord Melbourne was resolved to see her. The interview took place, not at Brighton, but at my cottage, whither the Colonel brought his lordship, and I sent for Harriette purposely to introduce her. His lordship was at first very sullen and half inclined to scold. Harriette's open and unaffected manner, (which, by the way, was all assumed,) gained upon his lordship, and he at last invited himself to tea.

During tea, he placed his hand on Harriette's shoulder, and spoke nearly as follows; --

"I came, Miss Wilson, with an intention to be displeased with you, and expected to have found a vulgar rapacious wretch, without talents and accomplishments -- such as I have been accustomed to find preying upon my son --- wolves, Miss Wilson, preying upon the innocent Lamb." Here his lordship smiled at his bad pun." I am agreeably deceived ; and if you can keep Fred to yourself, it will save him from ruin, and his family from great uneasiness. I know you must have great power over him, for your person and manners are irresistible. I fear you are not so comfortable as you ought to be, but I'll take care to make Fred a more liberal allowance, for your sake."

I never saw Harriette more overawed. She stammered out her fears that his lordship over-rated the influence of her charms, but *she loved* Fred too dearly not to lay herself out to keep him in her net as long as possible. After an agreeable conversation, which lasted about an hour, Lord Melbourne took leave, having first called me to the window, and put a paper into my hand, requesting me to give it my friend, when he was "out of earshot." The paper contained three Bank-notes of twenty pounds each, and never supply came more seasonably to any one, for Harriette was literally reduced to her last shilling.

And this is the trifle of which so much has been made. I can see nothing in it, but what is highly creditable to his lordship's parental feelings, and honorable to his generosity. But Miss Wilson, by dressing up the story in her way, has made Lord Melbourne appear to the world as an immoral, irreligious, pimping old man. Not a word does she say of the £60. Oh, no! she fancied such things a tribute exacted by the power of her charms, and felt no gratitude to the donor.

Miss Wilson is correct in saying that she made a trip to Hull with Fred Lamb, and that Gen. Mackenzie noticed her favorably. I was informed that the General had once to whisper Frederick to take her off the parade, where her flirting with the officers was so insufferably indelicate, that she occupied the attention of the whole régiment.

I was privy to Miss Wilson writing to the Marquis of Lorne; and let not my Readers wonder at my thus readily engaging in her schemes. The Colonel and Fred Lamb were great friends, and so were their two ladies, and at the time she addressed the Marquis, she and her keeper were on the point of separation. I was desirous of seeing her well settled, and had not the opinion she had herself of any marriage settlement ever being offered worth her acceptance. The Marquis of Lorne was a bachelor, a thing which Harriette, in her Memoirs, does not wish to be clearly understood thus she calls him, his Grace the Duke of Argyle, when he was only his grace-less son, and the same with many others, whom she terms Lords, who, at the time she knew them to be mere Honorables or Mrs. I beg to put my Reader in mind that I am not setting myself up for a paragon of virtue, at the best I was only a kept mistress, whose greatest merit was being constant to the man with whom I lived.

The Marquis, from motives unknown to me, made three different appointments to meet his female correspondent, all of which he broke; at last he met her in one of her walks, and she remained out very late; I believe it was near twelve at night when she came home, for then she usually slept at my house. We were both alone, the Colonel on duty at Windsor, and Frederick Lamb at Shorneliff Barracks.

She was in raptures with his grace's beauty, manners, and condescension, but more so with a bill for fifty pounds, and a diamond ring, he had presented her with. She ran on vaguely with an idea that the Marquis would instantly take her into keeping, and doubted not but in time she would be the Marchioness of Lorne. Her expectations were lowered, for, as he had acted in the first instance, so he did in the second, broke no less than four appointments, and did at last send Tom Sheridan to make his peace. I had a great respect for poor Tom, I knew his father, that fellow of excellent mirth and infinite fancy he often came to the Colonel's at the palace , and generally went away tipsy; he gave me much good advice , which I gratefully remember, though it was lost upon me, through my unfortunate situation. Young Tom inherited all his father's talents --- wit, humour, and a penchant for the convivial board; that, and the company of dissolute women at Edinburgh, where he lay with his regiment, broke his constitution, and hurried him, in the prime of life, to his grave.

The King, of his own free will, generously gave him an appointment of £1,200 per annum, at the Cape of Good Hope, but he was too far gone for any climate to save him; it may not be, but it ought to be universally known, to the honour of his present Majesty's heart, that when Tom was on the point of sailing for the Cape, he was cruelly arrested and thrown into a spunging-house; this was mentioned to the King, then Prince, at dinner, who whispered in Colonel M'Mahon's ear, and he immediately left the table. In about an hour, he returned, bringing Tom Sheridan, whom the Prince kindly took by the hand, bade him sit down, and made him tipsey. Tom told me this himself. Colonel M'Mahon, by the Prince's orders, paid Tom's debt to the tune of £295, and presented him with a £100 note that same evening at parting, telling him, "Here, Tom, I'm devilish poor, but I loved your father --- take this to buy you a hammock to stow away in on your voyage, and write to me from the Cape, and tell me how Constanstia drinks on its native soil."

Sheridan made some handsome excuses for his friend the Marquis: I was present at the interview, but nothing of the pathetic nature Miss Wilson so feelingly relates took place. It is not worth while contradicting her in this point - let the sentimental dialogue stand as a memento of the admirable tact at book-making she and her friend Stockdale possess. By-the-bye, what a horrid ugly fellow that Stockdale is to write pretty lies in a lady's book! Why,he has the Vice Society marked in his very countenance.

Poor Sheridan was then rapidly dying. I remarked to him, "you are still able to laugh.” 

"Yes," said he, "I shall go laughing from this world to the next."

Next morning early, the Marquis came on foot to see us; he is an inveterate pedestrian. After sitting awhile, he proposed, and to my astonishment and the total chagrin of Miss Wilson, he pressed me to accompany them. I was obliged to comply. The conversation ran upon indifferent subjects, and the Marquis was what he can be, when he pleases, a most agreeable and instructive companion. The only time he mentioned love, was in allusion to Frederick Lamb.

"And you really don't love Frederick Lamb?"

"No; I never did in my life, though I once deceived myself by thinking so."

"Do you conceive yourself capable of loving any other person?"

"Yes, provided he loved me in return, and that most passionately."

“I fear me, Harriette, your love would be too hot to last long; it would blaze and expire in smoke --- never burn like a taper on an altar, with a pure, steady, and holy flame.”

"Yet my love is more holy than godly," replied Harriette, piqued at the serious tone with which the Marquis delivered his last sentence.

"I don't comprehend your meaning," said the Marquis, "what you never felt you cannot possibly understand, so we'll drop the subject. When did you see Cotton," he said, looking towards me. By this time we were nearly up the hill towards Pentonville, and the day was uncommonly sultry. Our beaux walked us into the Belvidere Tea Gardens, and ordered wine, fruits, and confectionery to be served in a little rural box. There was scarce any company , and the Marquis throwing off all reserve, commenced such a round of raillery, told so many humorous stories, sung songs, and acted the Harlequin so wonderfully well that we never laughed more in our lives, or enjoyed such a happy evening.

The Marquis now came frequently to the cottage, but he did not always come alone, nor always with the Colonel, and he divided his attention so equally betwixt me and Harriette, that no one could perceive he had a wish to do more than make himself agreeable company to a couple of vain women. Miss Wilson's letter in page 32 , vol. 1 of her Memoirs, is a made one, what is termed a *shew letter*. I have authority for saying that the Marquis never received it, or the lock of hair, which he did not even hint a wish to be possessed of, indeed he might have had head, body, and all for a single whisper.

The Marquis made both of us handsome presents at various times. I was aware that mine were intended as a recompence for the trouble he supposed his visits occasioned. I never concealed from the Colonel these transactions. Sundry hampers of claret and old hock gave great satisfaction to the Colonels (Thomas and Cotton), who could not raise their ideas to that pitch of liberality which could give such good things away for nothing. Assuredly there is more pleasure in giving than receiving, especially to a deserving object; and to a heaven-formed mind, the chief blessings of life is to render others blest.

A strange circumstance occurred about this time, which I can now very well account for. A black man frequently called with letters for Harriette, which she pretended were from her mother. I knew well that the poor woman could not afford even to hire a black servant for a day, she at that time living by grafting stockings, a business which, in her *home-days*, had often soiled the fair hands of the alabaster skinned Miss Wilson.

She used to take this fellow of the breed of Cain up stairs; and I once heard a report in the neighbourhood, that she had been seen with him in the gardens and shady walks near Chalk Farm, but I treated it at the time with contempt.

Since the explanation given by my Lord Craven, of the reason why he dismissed Harriette so suddenly from the cottage at Greenwich, I am, of course, thoroughly convinced, that a most disgusting and very improper intimacy subsisted betwixt this lady of fine feelings and her Mungo. If I recollect aright, she prevailed upon the Marquis to get him into the employment of an officer going on foreign service.

The passion Harriette expresses for reading was only the affectation of a passion; she had no real taste for reading, and I have often written out quotations from Shakespeare, Milton, and others, for her to use in conversation; from want of knowledge she so often misapplied them , that only her manner of expression caused her ignorance to be overlooked. I do not boast, when I say, that I found her very ill informed, and with a bad ear for music; and, after as much pains as ever I took with my own children, I made her, if not learned, or talented, quite clever enough to pass in thoughtless company as a polite and decently informed girl. Any one may perceive from the affected remarks made upon authors in her Memoirs, that they are mere *made-up* criticisms by her friend Stockdale, about as *just* as his translation of Voltaire's Life of Charles XII of Sweden, which is the Bamfylde Moore Carew of false biography. Apropos of this man Stockdale. I heard a good story of him, ridiculing his extreme ignorance. Here it is .

Young Lord Perceval employed him as his bookseller, and once ordered his "History of the Inquisition," a hugh quarto, to be sent to Curzon-street. Some time after, his lordship wandered into his shop (he then lived in Pall Mall, and was accounted somewhat respectable); it was filled with sprigs of nobility, purchasing his "Pigeons and Crows," then the rage; and Mr. Stockdale thought it a good time to throw out his line and fish for a compliment to his literary abilities.

"Pray my Lord," said he, with his accustomed sardonic grin, "what is your opinion of my history of the Inquisition." -- "I have not been able young wag." -- Why don't you get some one to put it into English." -- "English? English? why it is in English, my lord."

"Is it indeed," replied he, "then I must plead ignorance, and if your history, Mr. Stockdale, really be English, I am sorry to say that I left College without knowing a word of my native tongue." A loud laugh followed this admirable retort courteous, and the disconcerted egotist blushed till his saffron cheeks turned blue.

Miss Harriette, wantonly, and very unfeelingly, ridicules Mr. Horace Beckford, for a natural impediment in his speech: he was an accomplished gentleman, and she ought to have said nought of the hesitation in his speech - for, without any hesitation he gave her twenty pounds, when she asked him to lend her ten, only twenty-four hours after she had been introduced to him.

Harriette's conduct had given such offence to Frederick Lamb, that though he arrived in London, he came not to Somers Town to see her, and sent her sundry very angry letters , in one of which he plainly said, she had "placed antlers on his forehead." I sincerely pitied her, for I did not believe that she had been more than imprudent with any one. Argyle was the object of suspicion; and he, I could positively clear; he had watched Harriette most anxiously and attentively, and under the mask of heedless gaiety, scrutinized every action, and searched narrowly into the secret recesses of her heart.

He told me one day, when we were alone --- "'Tis a pity so beautiful a casket should hold within it no gem worth picking the lock to obtain." She is all hollow as sounding brass, or tinkling cymbals — she has no heart for any thing but flattery, fine clothes, and love of admiration." I presumed to dissent from this opinion, but he quickly silenced me:

"I once loved her, and wished to love her; but 'tis impossible to be seriously attached to a puppet: he who keeps her, must keep her for shew. She will try to please every one, but him whom she ought to please most. She is one of those creatures, nature makes thousands of in a hurry; merely animates their frames with the breath of life, and then throws them upon the world, ashamed of her handy work."

I found that Harriette could never acquire a constant protector, in the Marquis of Lorne, and the woman where she lodged, one of those silly gossips who run from door to door, to collect scandal, and retail it again with interest, informed me, that she had been of late obliged to apply to those harpies, the pawnbrokers, for temporary assistance. I was hurt and distressed beyond description; and the old woman had scarce left me in the garden, where I threw myself on a seat, when the Marquis of Lorne entered, and surprised me in tears. I, in vain, tried to conceal the cause of my misery, and he no sooner knew it, than he abruptly took leave, mounted his horse at the gate, and galloped away.

I was fearful that I had offended him, and perhaps lost Harriette his friendship for ever. But in the course of the day, I received a note from him, inclosing a sum, I am now, not permitted to mention. He desired me to put it to use, without delay, in relieving Harriette's embarrasments, and concluded his letter thus:

"Do not let the Colonel know any thing of this, and be assured, I will never see either of you more, if I find you tell Harriette from whence the assistance came; she cannot be grateful, and would probably apply to me the saying, "a fool and his money are soon parted;" so mark me, you pay her debts yourself, if you give her the cash, she will go out and squander it on gew-gaws, and to-morrow be as miserable as ever."

This liberality really astonished me; and I felt truly sorry that I was interdicted by the Marquis's orders, from letting the thoughtless girl know how highly she was indebted to such a noble spirit, and what a heart she might probably secure, by adopting a steady line of conduct, and giving some appearance of rationality to her actions.

The trifling of a pretty woman, is very pleasing amusement, even for the most sensible men, but always trifling produces a satiety, that eventually disgusts.

"Beauty soon grows familiar to the lover,
Fades in the eye, and palls upon the sense."

Then something is wanted to fill up the tedium of weary hours --- when the door is closed upon busy intruders, and the curtain let fall upon domestic scenes; when the ceremonies of state are all discarded, and the fire side is made the familiar resting place of body and mind. It is then the sterling qualities of a wife, or a fond companion become truly valuable; this is the time when her sterling worth is of service to herself. If she can bind the man to such a scene for hours, and he feels no inclination to wander abroad in quest of variety, she may calculate upon having really made a conquest-one of the heart, not liable to be ravished away.

I hold it as a proof of the very strong sense possessed by the Marquis of Lorne, that he was not led away by the outward appearance of Harriette Wilson, at least not so much as to be contented with brilliant embroidery put upon a flimsy garment, but looked for something which would not grow worse in the wearing.

The only method I could adopt, to apply the Marquiss's bounty as delicately as possible, was to offer it for Harriette's use, as though it were an advance from my own little purse.

She received my offer with gratitude upon her lips, but none I fear in her heart. The important business of calling all Harriette's creditors together and inducing them to accept a compromise, being over, we turned our attention towards the peculiarity of our own situation. It was evident Frederick Lamb had abandoned Hariette altogether; there were no aching hearts in question, and for her to remain in Somers Town, was very impolitic: "her face was her fortune," as the song says, and to make use of it in time, was the only policy. Before the Marquiss's bounty was expended, I persuaded her to take a furnished house, near Bedford-square, and promised to join her in a little time. The Colonel, from motives of prudence, had for many months shewn symptoms of seperating himself from me.

This was at first, a most terrible shock: I had ever considered and conducted myself as his wife, and within the very limited circle of his acquaintance, I had commanded that respect, few in my situation ever acquired. I had nothing to reproach myself with except the first folly, which my extreme youth in a great degree palliated. Time, indeed, made me fully sensible of my error, and in a moral point of view, I saw, in the fullest extent, the crime I was committing in living with my seducer; but the force of habit can not be shaken off like a loose garment, and the force of first love, is impetuous as the tide that murmuring runs and runs for ever. I had no home, no mother's hand extended to draw the wanderer back to virtue; and by a natural inclination, I clung to the author of ruin, whom I most sincerely loved. My punishment and my pleasures were both excessive; reflection, and the occupation of "teaching the young idea how to shoot," as my children began to toddle up the little eminence of infantine life, weaned me from the Colonel; his long absences had a powerful influence, and I at last could see him coming without joy, and let him depart without a wish for him to return.

He had long ceased to assist me in a pecuniary way, and the interest of my little fortune, would not suffice to keep me in the cottage; to trench upon the principal, was an injustice to my family I trembled to think of; so that I resolved to share the house in town, with Harriette, and wait whatever fortune might befal me, with patience
and resignation.

When Harriette left Primrose cottage, I proposed writing my determination to the Colonel; but he spared me the trouble, by sending an attorney to me, with a proposal which I very readily accepted, though the unfeeling way in which it came from a professional man and a total stranger, hurt my feelings greatly.

He proposed to place my boys in a respectable public school, and there support them: the girls he left me to dispose of, and assigned a very small annuity to each of them for life. As for me, I was left to shift as I thought proper.

He very soon quitted England with his regiment; and I have since often been made happy by reading his name in the Gazette, honourably mentioned. Thus, I was once more a single woman, but one not at all likely ever to change my situation; the high rank of my family, and the *faux pas* I had committed, were never to be forgotten. The world is very uncharitable! man may commit an hundred deviations from the path of rectitude, yet he still can return, every one invites him; in sober truth, he gains an eclat by his failings, that establish him on the Ton, and make him envied, instead of pitied or despised. But woman, when she makes one false step, can retrieve it no more! No one says

    "Lovely penitent arise,
    Come and claim thy kindred skies,
    Come thy sister angels say,
    Thou hast wept thy stains away."

She becomes a mark for the slow-moving finger of scorn, and a prey to misery; or, what is much more calamitous, the depraved victim of sensuality, looking upon the world as her scene of action, and mankind as her prey, till age, want, or disease lays her in oblivion's grave, with

    "Not a friend to close her eyes,"

or a heart to pour a benediction on her parting soul. These things I well knew, and made a resolution closely bordering on virtue, to avoid them by calling in every energy to my help, that reason yielded , and hope bade me depend upon. If I could not rise to a level with the *good*, it was in my power to keep myself far *above* the evil.

The motive contained in the last sentences, influences me in dictating these confessions.

My furniture was soon removed to town, and in a short space, I became settled on the second floor of Harriette's dwelling; for I willingly yielded to her the first, or false pride since ambition had no influence over me, and like two sisters, we shared every thing in common, except sleeping together.

There was one thing in which I was very serviceable to Harriette: as her amanuensis. She wrote a very indifferent hand, and her diction would have disgraced a milliner's apprentice. All her correspondence flowed from my brain and my pen; and to this circumstance, aided by an excellent memory, I am now indebted, for the recollection which enables me to give the substance, if not the very words, of most of her letters. Besides, I have fortunately retained copies of a great many letters; for we kept a common placebook for the purpose. My method was always so correct, that I believe, during my life, I have never suffered a letter of ten lines to go to the post, before I had copied it, and in return, I also recorded the replies. I have the originals of several letters sent to Harriette: our interests were so mutual, that they were considered joint stock property; and when we separated, I destroyed some hundreds of her *billets doux*. I am now very sorry for this, as I must fight her with her own weapons, to gain a victory favourable to my character and that of my friends. Enough and too much of this; but garrullity is excusable in a woman, and an injured one too.

We were visited in our new abode, by the friendly Marquis of Lorne, and with respect to female society, it was, thanks to our unfortunate situation, neither select nor numerous. Miss Amy Wilson and her sister Fanny, being the most prominent figures, in our tea-table landscape of beauty.

The former was a fine woman, with a Siddonian countenance, and a masculine spirit; the latter, a poor timid, good-natured thing, incapable of doing either harm or good, she scarcely knew the distinction betwixt virtue and vice; when she did good, it was from accident, when she committed evil, it was from want of knowing better, and she had a vacant see-saw way of thinking that every thing happened for the best. If you could not love her, it was impossible to hate her.

I was well acquainted that they were *protected*, and could not help regretting it. Miss Wilson gives an account of Fanny's death, which is all very true, and dwells upon the circumstance of Lord Yarmouth doing her a trifling service at her dying hour, as if to do a kindness, was in him a rarity. I hate condemning men by implication: no man is more erratic in his charities, than the present Marquis of Hertford; but few, very few noblemen do more real good privately. You will never see his name at the head of a "subscription pack," in a newspaper, where sums are put down, that are never paid. He certainly has an ungracious mode of giving, singular to himself. I remember a venerable clergyman telling him, that a certain Lying-in Hospital, was about to discharge several poor women, very prematurely, as the funds, for the year, ran short by £200.

"Curse the women," he said, "what the devil business have they with children, who cannot support them, I wish they were all in ----." At the same time, taking up his pen and giving a check for the money.

I have no recollection of ever being distinguished as one of the Graces, with Harriette and Fanny. She had, it appears, a wish to deify herself, and could not decently accomplish it without companions in her apotheosis. I was never sufficiently notorious for so high a distinction.

Miss Amy, was like her sister, without any fixed principle , except that of self interest; she was proud and avaricious. The old gentleman with whom she first lived , came to us with a complaint, that after having for years loved her, and nursed her like a child, she had persuaded him to settle one hundred a year on her for life, swearing never to leave him; he gave her the deed and fifty pounds to go shopping with, when oh! dire disaster, she made his own coachman set her down at General Madden's door, and sent back an affectionate verbal message, by the footman.

"Tell the old fool I have done with him, and shall see him no more."

'Twas impossible to be serious when the disconsolate and duped old Lothario made this heavy complaint, but at last I succeeded in persuading him, that it was worth one hundred a year to get rid of such an ingrate.

    "Pity melts the soul to love."

The old man often called, and I sympathised so much in his affection, that he begged of me to share it and his fortune, which was immense. I decidedly refused his proffered hand. I don't dislike cold, but abhor the *depth* of winter. Miss Wilson could not find in her heart to tell this anecdote of me. No; it would have redounded to my credit, and she would have had to remark that by her desire I actually proposed her to the old gentleman, who politely thanked me, but said,

"He couldn't abide her, for she was a devil incarnate, and always at the window, like the sign of Queen Elizabeth over a tavern door, to invite passers by to walk in."

Notwithstanding this, he accommodated Harriette with a sum of money, and made the same offer to me, who did not chuse to be under obligations to a man I had no esteem for, besides I had no wants of my own. I seldom got a friend but Harriette contrived to make use of his purse.

I well remember the time when she teased me into taking a box at the opera - house for the season. We could ill afford it. I had introduced her to a good deal of respectable society, chiefly males indeed; which was owing to my brother, an officer in the army, who arrived from abroad, having obtained a majority through his valour.

He forgave me for being led astray by Cotton, because I had left him. He lodged at the Russell Coffee-House, and made our house what he termed "his head quarters," so that every morning we had a military levee. He tried in vain to bring my mother and me together, but she was not to be persuaded, I was sorry for this, as it would have been the means of restoring me to respectability.

It was I that introduced Harriette to Count Beckendorff, he was a gallant and sensible Russian; there is not a word of truth that he wished to have married Amy. He knew her history, and was so familiar with her that, I am sure, he had no reason to marry her. It was General Madden who brought the Duke of Devonshire to see us. Harriette never presumed to treat him as she has written: 'tis true she made love to him, and he was truly deaf to her intreaties; but being a Duke, she could not help telling fibs about him --- besides Stockdale found it convenient to have his name to *grace* the Wrapper of the Memoirs.

I must here allude to Harriette's description of the scenes in our opera box, which she has embellished most luxuriantly. Lord Alvanley honoured us with his acquaintance, both at home and abroad; he was a bachelor, and could be seen in our company without fear of reproach.

Harriette has given a very coarse and vulgar picture of a good humoured, kind-hearted, agreeable, gentlemanly person, it was impossible to offend him, he was always in a good humour with himself and all around him. He did what scarce another nobleman of his age would have done; he once had an unfortunate penchant for gaming, he was venturous, young, and unwary. The blacklegs got hold of him, and he was fleeced. This compelled him to run in debt with his tradespeople. Being a single man, he could have done as Jack did,

    "Who ran in debt, and then to pay,
    He distanced all and ran away."

But Lord Alvanley possessed an honourable principle; he evaded his creditors for a little time, and then came to the magnanimous resolution of doing them justice, by depriving himself of equipage, house, and establishment. He broke up his household, abandoned all his large fortune to discharge his debts, and retired with a single servant into a private lodging, to live on seven hundred a year. This mode of living he patiently endured for several years, when, being free, he not only succeeded to his own estates unencumbered, but a large legacy left by a relation. No one ever deserved it better.

Lord Alvanley dealt much in small talk, or chit chat a-la-mode; he paid very little attention to any of us but Fanny, whom he used like a kitten. She was tame enough for any purpose, and delighted to laugh at his lordship's jokes, though they generally bore hard upon hers画elf.

The night alluded to, when the Duke of Devonshire came into our box, Harriette was greatly mortified; he merely nodded to her, and then addressed himself to me. Lord Alvanley never spoke to her; and Luttrell, who was generally in good temper, said something sarcastic, which put her out of sorts all the evening. I feel no concern that she says,

"Poor Julia all this time did not receive the slightest compliment or attention from any body." This is a libel upon the good breeding of so many fashionable men, which every one will know could not possibly be true. I never had to complain of wanting attention; nor ever knew that Harriette *present* or *absent* had power to deprive me of a single friend or admirer. Mr. George Brummell is well known to all that ever passed up and down St. James's-street; he was polite to everybody but Harriette, who was once the means of providing him with a challenge from one of her admirers. George scorned to fight for any demirep on earth, and she never forgave him.

That monstrous eclat of setting men together by the ears, and trying to get them to shed each other's blood to enhance her own fame, was the wish of Harriette's heart, but she never could attain her object. I have heard that she tried to bring Lord Alvanley into a scrape of this kind, but he managed to keep clear of the business.

"You ought to fight Lord N---," said she, "he called you every thing but a gentleman to me."

“I forgive him for that," said Alvanley, "he envied me standing so well with you, and wanted to oust me."

"Oh, but he slandered me as your accomplice, in a way quite shocking."

“He could not slander you, Harriette, say what he would concerning you; you are slander-proof."

“You have a mean spirit, my Lord,” said she in a fury.

"And I mean to keep my spirit for a better purpose, than getting shot at for one that is not worth powder."

For some time after this sparring they were on bad terms, but Lord Alvanley never cherished enmity.

Apropos of George Brummell: Miss Wilson interlards her intrigues with stories, so why should not I?

When Mr. Hoare was only beginning to sparkle in the west, and only known by his forwardness, he got excessively tipsy at a gaminghouse, and went to sleep; when he awoke, Lord Petersham and others made him believe, he had lost a dinner to the company. Brummell, who was of the party, being asked a few days after, if Mr. Hoare had paid the penalty. "Oh, yes," replied George, "he gave us an excellent good dinner, but he behaved most impertinently."

"How so, George?"

"Why he sat down and partook of it with us."

Alas! poor George, his pride is now all over, I never had the honour to refuse his hand in marriage, for he never offered it to me. This is of a piece with all that lady's falsehoods concerning me; but I verily believe, that with the broken bridge of his nose, nor any nose at all, Harriette would most gladly have taken him. The conversation she relates about Colonel Cotton is neither decent nor true.

Harriette mentions the Hon. John Ward, at Amy's supper, very splenetically and this the reason why, he had reported among his friends, that she was "so great a liar as not to be believed, even if she took her oath on Sunday in a church during sacrament." *Ces sont les mots de Milord*

I have since found he was not too severe. Miss Wilson makes Lord Alvanley speak of "d--n sugar baker." I have been much in his company, and never heard him swear before ladies, nor did I ever hear that his lordship was addicted to so vulgar a vice. *Dementor n'est sa foiblesse.*

The long attempt at causing Fanny to be witty upon Lord Alvanley is all fiction, from beginning to end. She was too much afraid of him to make so free, and had neither wit nor humour for any thing, but cats-play at home. Lord Palmerston, to my knowledge, never was at Amy's. I know him very well, he did not admire such characters, but delighted in modest tranquil society.

Miss Wilson relates driving to Argyle-House in a Russian carriage. Now it so happened, that we went home together in a hackney coach, setting down Mr. Brummell in our way: she made several attempts to get invited to Argyle-House, but as the Marquis did not take her hints, she wrote him a note. I refused to dictate.

Whilst Harriette was debating whether to be offended, and order her doors to be shut against the Marquis, his name was announced; he had come to entreat us to accompany him and his friend Captain Sir Joseph Nourse, K.C.G.C.B. of the Royal Navy, to a dinner party at Highgate, or any other place we liked better.

"What sort of an answer is this you sent to my letter?" said Harriette, pouting and half inclined to be angry.

"A Rowland for an Oliver," said he; "but really our house is out of repair, and there is no place where I could invite you into, unless it was my bed-chamber.”

"I would not object to that ," said Harriette, "providing the way to it lay through the family chapel." The Marquis looked grave.

"Our chapel," he added, "is only used for a burying place, so let that rest."

We were soon on the drive to Hampstead. Captain Nourse was one of the handsomest well made little men I ever beheld; his teeth were like rows of pearl set in coral, his complexion the rose and the lily, and his auburn hair curled in natural ringlets over his clear high forehead; his eyes sparkled with intelligence, and his discourse was elegant and animated. I was almost in love with him. Harriette laid herself out to catch his attention; but whether he was aware that his friend admired her, or from choice, I will not pretend to say, but he devoted himself to my services, and I candidly own I was for one of the few times in my life *bien ravi*. *Au reste, on badinoit l'un l'autre de tour au tour*.

We dined under a tent on Hampstead Heath, and spent a very happy day. Sir Joseph observed to me, " Your friend Harriette is very pretty, and would make an excellent sailor's wife, she swears such good round oaths." She had indeed got a knack of swearing by her maker too often, and I had often cautioned her on the silly as well as immoral habit. She thought it gave her conversation a zest, as olives do wine. Lord Petersham once said, an oath came prettily from her lips; and she has practised swearing pretty much ever since. We rambled along the high-way enjoying the invigorating breeze and enchanting prospects, while they prepared coffee. We observed a horseman coming along at full gallop, swinging from side to side like a monkey on a slack wire. We ran across the heath to get out of his way, but he turned his horse and followed us, crying

    "Hark forward, away, tallyho!"

with the lungs of a stentor, and alarmed us very much. "Let us see what this impertinent fellow wants," said the Marquis, and at once we were abandoned by our beaux, who, sticks in hand, advanced up to the rough rider in threatening attitudes. He, however, quickly alighted, and shaking hands, exclaimed

"An agreeable surprise, by G-d, who the devil expected to find your Grace and my friend the Captain hare hunting on Hampstead Heath! Introduce me to the ladies;" and, without waiting for the ceremony, came up and hoped he had not frightened us; but his horse well knew how partial his master was to ladies, and that he never saw a *stray* petticoat on a common but he ran after it.

"Strange fellow this;" said I, "is he mad? Will he bite?" said Harriette, sidling up to the Duke. "No!" exclaimed Sir Joseph," he is very harmless and very much at your service , he is the far-famed redresser of wrongs, and Don Quixote of the British metropolis, Mr. Ex-Sheriff Parkins."

We were now eased of our fears, and promised ourselves some amusement. So I whispered Sir Joseph to invite him to join us. "No occasion for that, my dear," said he, "he has joined us, and the devil will not be able to shake him off again till his inclination suits him."

As he said, so it was, for he hallooed to his servant, "here, rascal, put my horses up at the Spaniards, and wait there, I shall be with you in four or five hours, so get you gone, there's a shilling to fill you with belly-timber and grog, and mind you keep sober." We now all proceeded to the tent, when the keen air having given the Sheriff an appetite, he attacked the remains of a cold turkey and ham, with considerable alacrity and effect.

The Champaign lighted up his ferrets eyes, with fire, and he rubbed his hands in extacy. As he gormandised, we had time to anatomize him. A very odd fellow, indeed - strange, passing strange! Have you seen him, Reader? Some of you have not; and he may be dead before you do: your great men never live long. Yes, he is a very rough-looking Sheriff indeed, answering the description of Paddy Carey:

    "With brawney shoulders, three feet square,
    Cheeks like thumping red potatoes."

The *lad* also had "a carrotty poll," and was amazingly stout built; his flesh and sinews appeared as though knitted together. To give a better idea of Sir Joseph Nourse's, he appeared as though he had been originally six feet and a half perpendicular and jammed down with a great stone to five feet eight inches, notwithstanding his hung-beef looking countenance (dried , I presume, under an Indian sun) there was a great deal of satirical good humour, blended in it, and he always had a smile at his own service, for he seemed to agree marvellously well with himself.

As the champaign mounted, Parkins began to shew off, and declared Harriette was the loveliest girl he had ever seen, save and except a niece of *Purserm-bhow's*, at Masulipatam, in India, who flung herself into the Ganges in despair, because he refused to have her and ten lacs of rupees, on account of her mahogany complexion, and a habit she had of anointing herself with cocoa-nut oil. Mem. I understand, he has the picture of this beauty, hung up in his library.

“Where do you live now?" inquired Sir Joseph.

"Mostly in Newgate, or a court of justice, trying to save the innocent from the gallows, and redress the poor man's grievances. There is no law in your rascally country, but practical injustice. And, I say, Marquis, these bullocks, mind me of elephant-hunting among the Jungles, in Burserampore. My service to you ladies, this champagne beats rack-punch hollow; and, let me see, if my ocular demonstration does not deceive me, neither of you young gigglers are married. My service to you, Marquis. I wish you would take compassion on a bas---batchelor, who is---no matter for that a friend of the Duke of Norfolk's - and, my service to you, Captain. Ah! neither your services nor mine are properly rewarded. When do you marry Lady Sarah? Didn't the French whack you, somewhere, and you got knighted for it? My service. Here's champaign to our real friends, and real pain to our sham friends.”

"God defend us!" cried Harriette. " You say you left your heart in India, it is a pity but you had left a little of your tongue with it; we stand no chance here."

The "worthy sheriff" rode by the side of our carriage all the way home, bawling in at the window, a long story about one Major Mouncey, who rode forty miles on a hot day, over the plains of Hindostan, stark naked, on a horse, without saddle or bridle.

I could not decently refrain from asking him to alight, and walk in; he declined, but swore he would see us very soon. Take him for all and all, he was very entertaining, and I have heard, with many eccentricities, does a great deal of good in his own way, which is like that of no other human being.

Harriette used to boast of being very intimate with him after this, and said he treated her with pastry at the Yorkshire-stingo bunhouse, and forced upon her, four pounds sixteen shillings and sixpence, the change out of a five pound note, to buy her a pair of shoes. I certainly do not believe her in this, for he never called again at our house, and when we passed him on the drive in Hyde Park, he returned her forward civility, with a distant bow.

I merely repeat this story, as I may many others, in which I was mutually concerned with Harriette. To forestal her news, and prevent her from making the persons subjects of her scandalous pen, surely, when she sees the real truth exhibited, she will pause before she dares to hang around it the drapery of falsehood.

There is one thing, which I speak of as a certainty: Harriette Wilson, will attack no poor man; for she can get nothing from him; -- she will not expose many single men, for they need not care for her calumnies; but the wealthy and wedded, are her marks, whose money may be expected to bribe her to silence, and many who have no more than innocently prattled with her, sooner than run the risk of having suspicion sown in the minds of their wives and families, by her artful insinuations, will, I apprehend, submit to her extortions.

If ever she meets with one firm enough to bring her into a court of justice, there will be an end to her career, and perhaps this little book, may, if it does not silence her, at least bridle her impertinence, and compel her to keep within the line of decency. I am sure I shall be the soother of many family quarrels, and bring some divided pairs together again, in harmony and concord.

Let not Miss Harriette's friend and publisher, frown at me; setting *my own reasons* aside, we all know that there are many impositions practised in making books; and where the origin of one, is brought from high public characters, every person has a right to interpret it's meaning, or to question its authenticity, particularly when composed by one who in the early part of her life, was a burthen upon the community, and in the latter part of it, has become a nuisance.

I cannot omit noticing a very ridiculous tale of the amiable Russian Ambassador, going purposely to Russia, to solicit the Emperor's permission to marry Amy. Really, friend *Stockdale*, thou shouldst have taught thy pupil not to consider all the world as foolish as she is wicked. A Russian noble is independent of his Sovereign, in all matters of a domestic nature, and may marry whom he pleases.

In what a way does the heartless woman expose the vices of her own family! She talks as calmly of Amy swindling the *Count Palmella* out of two hundred pounds, as if it were an act of honesty, and in the same sentence, speaks of her, as worthy to marry an honourable man!! Such shameless impudence is sufficient of itself to falsify all her statements. She speaks of Lady W--- publicly exposing herself with the Marquis of Lorne, when that lady's husband was in town, and when no one but a Harriette Wilson dared to slander her good name. The ironical manner in which Miss Wilson speaks of me, throughout her memoirs, tells a plain truth, that I was her most successful rival, or what she once phrased it, the decoy duck that carried away all her sportsmen. I never made any effort to accomplish this: it happened generally, that I found on entering a room, the beaux all crowded near Harriette; but as the evening advanced, they generally formed a sober circle round me. She was, Lord Ponsonby once flatteringly observed to me, "the *meteor* that dazzled from its borrowed lustre for a time, and then faded away; but that I was the *steady planet*, a source of never fading attraction, whose vivifying heat was by all acknowledged and felt by all." Is this vanity? I believe so, no woman was ever without a portion of it, and mine I hope to be very small.

Where Harriette condescends to flatter, it is done in such a way, that it is too gross for the palate, thus she says: -"Julia at her Mamma's made conquests every where, and every hour; even *the Regent* himself once said, he would travel an hundred miles to have the pleasure of seeing her dance."

I might put up with a little stretch of this sort in my favour; but have no stomach to swallow praise made sickening, by gross falsehood.

At my Mamma's I had no opportunity of seeing company; and, as matter of course, made no *conquests*. I was, in fact, so very young, that I never thought of setting my cap at any one. Had I, at the period alluded to, mixed more in the world, and known more of male society, I should not have fallen a sacrifice to a married man, old enough to be my grandfather. Once, indeed, I went to a ball, given by *the Prince* to the junior branches of noble families, and shall never forget the happiness I enjoyed. His affability, cheering smiles, and restless anxiety to make the party happy, were perfectly captivating. He had something to say to all; and wandered about the ball-room, like a fond father among his doating children. Those who have seen our gracious Prince at such moments, when he casts off Majesty, and descends to the state of a private gentleman, can never forget the impression he makes on the finer feelings of our nature. So far from *the Prince* using the expressions Harriette says he did towards me, he absolutely gave me a rub: more engaged in staring at him, than minding my partner in the dance, I forgot the figure, and when we had gone down he laid his hand upon my head, and said, "the little Julia is an excellent romp, but she must mind her dancing or stand up no more, she puts all the set out." I did not dance any more during the evening, though this gentle reproof had no effect upon my spirits: - at twelve years old , the heart is too buoyant to let any thing weigh heavily on it long.

I may, probably, have told this anecdote to *Debouchet*; and she, in her wish to appear acquainted with every thing high, trumped up the preceding story.

I will give you an instance of her aspiring temper, which knew no bounds of reason, and made her overstep all the forms of common politeness; and she lost many friends by it. I had the good fortune and honour, once or more, to be invited, through the old Marquis of Hertford, to a party in which the Prince Regent mingled *incognito*. This threw Harriette into hysterics, with envious rage; and as I refused to tell her what passed, she became still more irritated. I introduced her, one Sunday, in Kensington Gardens, to the Prince's Secretary, Colonel M'Mahon, that ugly, but amiable Irishman. He had, indeed, a most excellent heart, with a good many serious failings. He was hourly ridiculing morality, and yet valued it in himself; he made a jest of all religion, but daily practised the highest christian virtues; he loved to

    "Do good by stealth, and blushed to find at fame."

The poor fellow is gone, however, and this short tribute is due to his memory, who, when living, would have been offended at it.

Well, I had made him and *Harriette Debouchet* acquainted. My reader will excuse me if, in my hurry, I often call Harriette by her family name. I know she hates to be reminded of her low origin; but no matter, I intend no insult, so she must consider it none.

Colonel McMahon was much taken with her beauty, and praised it in fulsome language. She hoped this would have led to a meeting with his master; but, notwithstanding the Colonel frequently met us, nothing came of it. She was not of a disposition to be defeated in any object she had in view, by stronger obstacles than a private Secretary's delicacy; and, therefore, applied to the Colonel to speak in behalf of a near relation of her's, who had lost his commission in the navy, through some imprudence, — not any thing very serious. The Colonel afterwards said he had done so, and that the Regent refused to interfere with what concerned the Lords of the Admiralty, alone.

She wrote the succeeding letter.

    To the Right Hon. John M'Mahon.

    Sir, I fear your delicacy prevented you from
    fully stating my case about Bob, to the Prince
    Regent. I think he would not refuse me, if I
    could see him *in propria persona*. You often
    praise my "glowing eyes:" think you I could not
    look him into compliance? Pray let me try.
    
    You told me the Regent often comes to your
    house on evenings. I will put on my best bib and
    tucker, and best face and air, and ---- but,
    surely, you cannot refuse me! the servant will
    await your reply; adieu.

    HARRIETTE WILSON.

The Servant returned with a verbal message that a reply would be sent in course of next day. Harriette sat upon thorns, and did not sleep all night. At breakfast the Colonel's servant brought this billet: -

    To Miss Wilson.

    Dear girl-Unfortunately for you, but not for
    your relation, I had taken the liberty of resuming
    the subject of your wishes, in a conversation
    with His Royal Highness, a few hours before I
    received your letter. The enclosed will show
    you the result has not been unfavourable: --

    "Perhaps, at some future day, I may procure
    the honour you are, I perceive, so anxious to
    obtain.

    "Always your's,
    "J. M.MAHON."

Nothing could exceed the mortification this polite epistle conveyed to Harriette's mind. It was evident her letter had been shewn to the Prince, who, to get rid of the interview as delicately as possible, preferred restoring the young man to his rank.

Harriette did not care a fig for the favour granted, but her pride was reduced to the most abasing humility, and all the laurels vanity had decorated her head with, were blighted in their bloom.

----

I had a key to the gardens of Buckingham House; and not unfrequently indulged Harriette and her sisters with a walk there, when none of the Royal Family were in the way. By means of this privilege, I one day contrived to exhibit Miss Debouchet, at a moment when she could not summon forth that arch brilliancy of eyes upon which she so much prided herself; and which, like the artfulness of her tongue and pen, are calculated to ensnare first, and then deceive.

On this occasion, the worthy secretary had placed his master where he could see Harriette at his leisure, and himself remain hidden from view. The Regent did not admire the contour of her face, nor the shape of her arm. Colonel M'Mahon told me this. I repeated it to Fanny, and she "let the cat out of the bag." Harriette never forgave me this *ruse*; and to this, in a superlative degree, I attribute the spiteful manner in which I am shewn off in her scandalous Memoirs. She will not like this little exposure of her vanity, and still less what may follow: *toute a bonne heure, brillante femme; je t'aime assez pour te voir tout nue, soit personne soit caractere.*

----

Now I am upon the subject of the Prince, I will just mention a fact concerning myself: 'tis from no personal vanity of my own that I do so; indeed, there is not any thing in the transaction which could raise self-opinion in the least. But, as Harriette Wilson is in possession of the facts, she may turn them to a very bad purpose, as she has done regarding many similar affairs; for, in the virulence of her heart, when she finds how completely I am exposing her, she will probably ransack the stores of her brain to build a pyramid of slander on Julia's devoted head. She who will not hesitate to strike at the most exalted character in the nation, is not likely to permit me to rest from her malevolence, seeing that

    "Envy does merit as its shade pursue."

I took occasion to petition His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, on account of a claim I had, which descended to me through an officer of our family, who fell abroad fighting for his country.

The Earl of Liverpool returned my petition with a civil note, "That he did not think fit to lay it before his Royal Highness." Thereupon I thought proper to try another quarter; and in my own proper person took it to Sir Benjamin Bloomfield. I had never before seen this gentleman; and had formed a very bad opinion of him, from his writing books for blacksmiths, and having horse shoes called by his name; for Cotton was at one time eternally talking of the breeding stud at Hampton Court, and "the Bloomfield shoe." I was, therefore, agreeably surprised to find Sir Benjamin a manly genteel looking soldier, who received me with great urbanity.

He would not answer for the success of my petition, "but as it was so very short, and divested of politics, he could construe it into 'household business,' and lay it before the Prince the first favourable opportunity."

This was enough for me, who neither expected or wished for the honour of a private conference. I was gratified with the succeeding note: -

    Madam,
    Carlton House, February.
    I am commanded to return your petition, and express sorrow that it is impossible to grant it's prayer, except through the medium of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

    His Royal Highness the Prince Regent desires me to beg your acceptance of the enclosure, which he hopes may be of service.

    I have the honour to be,
    Madam,
    Your faithful humble servant,
    B. BLOOMFIELD.

The enclosure was a bank note for £100. I made no further attempt to forward my petition, which I considered as honourably dismissed. had made no complaint of poverty, as most suppliants do; so that this noble gift was a spontaneous free-will offering from a feeling heart, and I can only add, that what was bountifully given, was gratefully received.

This is the whole truth: and now, *Miss Harriette Debouchet*, to work "with what appetite you may."

----

*Lord Frederick Bentinck* is a man whose character can never be injured by the sneers of such a woman as Harriette Wilson. He was really her friend; and from the best motives was continually advising her, to adopt a life of more discretion. He entertained no improper ideas towards her; and had she been a virtuous girl, I do not doubt but she would have stood a fair chance of becoming what she never was, and now will never be -- *a lady*.

I ought, perhaps, to beg the lady's pardon, as I understand she gives out being married. However that may be, Hymen's bond may make an honest woman, but cannot constitute a lady. I have heard, that the man whose name she now assumes, (good heavens, how many names has she worn threadbare!) was once an officer who raised a regiment for the South American market; but not being able to find money to pay the equipments furnished, he was compelled, though not bred to the bar, to become *'a Bencher'*, under the care of Chief Justice Abbott. Report said, that, in the walls of "Abbott's priory," he was better known than trusted; and that the pretty little feet of Harriette Wilson, which Dukes were so proud to admire, (so she tells us) were often tripping down the merry dance, to the tune of a Jew's harp in a *"Tape Shop."* *This*, my brother says, is the elegant name for a private place where they retail geneva "neat as imported;" and Captain Jones declared to me, (what, if he was not a man of undoubted veracity, I would presume to question), that he had seen Harriette pour down *"blue ruin"* as glibly as she formerly used Curacoa at two guineas a flask: but more of this anon. I cannot conceive any man in his proper senses would marry a woman who had been kept monthly, daily, nay, hourly, by hundreds of men, and deceived and duped them all. Truly, my worthy Captain, peeping from the sky parlour in the *Rue St. Honore*, married or not married, I give you joy of *Mrs. Mungo*.

Miss Harriette has no occasion to ridicule the *small-clothes* of Lord Frederick Bentinck: the purse they carried was often drawn out to administer to her necessities and extravagance; and I have often noticed her pleading poverty, and declaring she had not a fire in the grate at home, or a chop in the larder, when no sooner has his lordship put a note into her hand, than she has gone into a shop, and squandered it away on trinkets, laughing in his face at his credulity.

I have a recollection of many of the fooleries she relates concerning Sir William Abdy, whose wife was seduced by Lord Charles Bentinck; and I believe she does not go beyond the mark in her description of the silly acts and language of the unfortunate baronet. I always considered his understanding as impaired; and, with his person, sinking into second childhood. Yet was it cruel to deride him with his foibles, who had been exposed sufficiently before! But she has a right to speak truth; and I am glad to be enabled to acknowledge that she does so, at any time, even on a painful subject like this.

About two months after our trip to Hampstead, an incident occurred, which shook my faith in the remains of Harriette's *virtue*.

Sir Joseph Nourse was very often a morning visitor near Bedford Row; and becoming intimate with my brother, he brought him, whenever he pleased, to our family parties of an evening. He was agreeable to all; and receiving no encouragement from me beyond a smile and a shake of the hand, he planted the battery of his blue eyes against Miss Harriette's bosom, which was indeed open to receive him and his impressions. It was, to use a saying of my brother's, of little avail to affect defending the breast-work, when you have determined to surrender the citadel.

I came home one afternoon to dress for the play, and entering the drawing-room, was told that Harriette could not be of our party, she having gone out with Sir Joseph Nourse. After I had decorated myself, I stepped into her bedroom for a necklace, and picked up from the carpet a silver-mounted pen-knife , marked *"J. Nourse”*; this directed my attention to a *certain place*, where all was in complete confusion.

Next morning at breakfast I drew the knife from my reticule, and observed where I had found it. The lady's cheeks reddened like fire; and after some hesitation, she "recollected borrowing it from the gallant captain to cut her boot lace." This lame excuse would not do for me, who knew she had plenty of such articles on her toilette, and I said, "I fear you two have been disputing either for love or spite, and this weapon has been dropt in the fray."

"I scorn your suspicions," exclaimed the fiery little meteor, "and would have you to know I am mistress of my own actions, and will not be schooled like a child."

"Pretty *child*," said I, smiling, and making up my mouth for a pun, "it has, I dare say, just escaped from the arms of its Nourse." High words followed this sally, and we separated, not to meet again for a month; during which period the captain was a daily visitor, and in every respect, *sans doute*, a favoured lover. I will conceal nothing. In this instance I was certainly tinctured not a little with jealousy. Captain Nourse had flattered me by his attentions, and I did not know he had made such havoc in my breast, until I felt he could go astray to another. I condemn myself for this kind of fooling, when I reflect on it; for, what right had I to expect a person to be constant to me, who never made a declaration of his sentiments? — and besides, was he not a sailor?

Miss Wilson, for the sake of eking out her Memoirs, interlards them with a great deal of downright trash, and much of it so very masculine, that she has borrowed it, beyond all question, from some wholesale manufacturer of the Colonnade, where they *work by the yard*, and blacken all they touch. *Mais albons Messieurs.*

She and I once took a trip to Salt-Hill, where we remained ten days: it was for the purpose of keeping out of the way of Frederick Lamb, who was in full chase of Harriette all over London; and I could not blame her for wishing never to see him more.

We had no other male companions, on this occasion, than an ensign of an Irish regiment, who was introduced to us by the landlady. He sometimes read to us at our tea, and accompanied us in our short evening walks. He was perfectly harmless, and nearly *innocent*: and, on account of the colour of his hair, had obtained the nickname of " Sheepy." I believe it was the coachman who thus christened him.

Harriette has, in her broken narration, excluded me from this cocknified country excursion altogether; simply, I suppose, for the purpose of giving herself an air of singularity — of “the eccentricity of genius," as Lady Craven has it. She endeavours to let the reader know her age was then nineteen; of a truth, she might be correct *then* in her judgment; but at this time of day, this very month, if I am not mad as a march hare, she is FORTY THREE YEARS FOUR MONTHS old! Tell it not in Paris! publish it not at Stockdale's!! lest the daughters of impurity rejoice, and the children of intemperance be glad to hear, that the once ministering angel at the altar of love, is now old enough to be the grand-mother of angels, in that kingdom below, where

    "Hope ne'er dawns and pleasure never smiles."

'Tis not many weeks ago since I saw this industrious piece of capricious biography, and my visual organs bare testimony to the correctness of my memory.

    "Me she has described falsely in her fables,
    A just retaliation is not revenge;
    Yet will I cry quits, and describe her truly,
    Not as once she was, but such as now she is."

Imagine to yourself a little woman, in a black beaver hat, and long grey cloak, of a piece with those of

    "Troy's proud dames, whose trailing garments swept the ground."

No *tightening* at the waist, to show the *figure* of the wearer, nor any ornament to be seen whatever. Her figure, at a short distance, might not inaptly be compared to a mile-stone, with a carter's hat resting on its summit. Her once little feet, now covered with *list shoes*, to defend them from attacks of a desultory gout, which she has suffered by in both extremities. Her *face*, at the time I allude to, was swollen with this disorder almost to distortion. She has *no colour*: *le couleur de rose a disparu*, and in its place appears a kind of dingy lilac, which spreads all over her once bright countenance, and appears burnt into her lips. The crow's feet are wide spreading beneath her eyes; which, though sunken, still gleam with faded lustre through her long dark eye-lashes. She bears the remains of what was once superlatively lovely - the wreck of the angel's visage, is yet to be seen; it looks interesting in decay - not the decay brought on by age and infirmity, but beauty hurried away prematurely, from the practices of a licentious and dissolute life; - such is the once celebrated Miss Debouchet, alias Wilson.

I wish I could have drawn a more favourable picture of this living wreck; but even here I have leaned to the side of mercy with generous recollections.

----

The whole article about her studying the characters of Pitt and Fox, bears the marks of being written by some vulgar-minded man. --

I should think Stockdale, from the political prejudices it betrays , and the selection of good-for-nothing books introduced; among these we find "Charles the Twelfth," and the "Confessions of Jean Jaques, Rousseau," both publications of that gorgon-faced bookseller.

----

Respecting the little Sophia -- the travelling black-pudding merchant. Harriette Wilson accuses Lord Deerhurst of deliberately seducing her sister Sophia, at the age of thirteen. To my certain knowledge it is an abominable falsehood, and I could swear it.

It is with real pain I mention this lady's name, since she became *Countess of Berwick*, she has thrown aside *toute les Peccadilles*. She has acted as the worthy wife of a most worthy and benevolent man ought to act; she does more, she does honour to her title; and when I look to the list of many now wearing coronets, who once were mistresses of the donors, not one of them will bear comparison with her for all the gentler feelings of the heart, and generous impulses of a woman's warm and friendly nature.

    "There love and charity doth blend
    To every friendless name-a friend."

It has fallen to my lot to do what I feel conscious nothing earthly could induce her ladyship to do, namely, to prove a sister false, malicious, cruel, and unnatural. Yet will I speak of her, - of Sophia, without reserve.

    "Nothing extenuate,
    "Or set down aught in malice."

She is well convinced, now, that though we never agreed in her early youth, I incurred her hatred from the best of motives; a wish, on my part, nearly allied to parental affection, to preserve her from the early ruin that sent her headlong amongst that society where the voice of virtuous applause is never heard, and the hope of honest fame never sojourns. She was a mere child when she left her mother's poverty-stricken threshhold, to become a *moveable boarder* amongst her sisters in town. They had contrived to bestow upon Sophy a tolerable education: she was some-time a day scholar at a seminary of high repute, under the patronage of the Margravine of Anspach. Here she benefitted by tuition for seven years - very early years, it is true; but she had capacity beyond what might have been expected from her age, and learnt rapidly, all the light accomplishments, that qualify our sex to shine in the ball-room and musical *conversatione*, she acquired without an effort. She was nearly self-taught in the French and Italian languages, and had a pretty tolerable idea of the world's history, with a sovereign contempt for Monk Lewis', Mrs. Radcliffe, and all the baneful tribe of novel and romance writers, in whom her sisters so much delighted.

She was very pretty when I first saw her — I was going to say, *welcomed* her to our house; - but I could not do so in sincerity; for I foresaw the snares that were twining about her, and as my own daughters were safe from a polluted atmosphere -- for such, though I include myself in the sweeping clause, is the atmosphere where a woman bereft of virtuous reputation, exists; she breathes pestilence, and walks in corruption -- her course is that of a crazy and rotten bark, gliding rapidly along a turbulent and impure stream, among rocks and quicksands, where it is prematurely wrecked, or after many weary struggles, is lost in the dark ocean of oblivion.

Sophia was very giddy, and vain of her person; she gave herself the airs of a woman, when but a pert and froward child; and *Harriette* very foolishly, if not wickedly, continually cockered up her ideas with hopes of making conquests -- of bringing this lord and that knight to her feet; and in a very short time the little creature talked of nothing else but "levelling a peer" - "winging a duke" - "dropping a baronet" - "hamstringing an alderman" - "scattering the scarlet" - "burning the blue," and a hundred more such terms, from the *Petersham* and Berkeley vocabulary, which imply the seduction of mankind.

It was *Harriette* herself who first put it into Sophy's head to assault Lord *Deerhurst*. On my honour, I do not believe Harriette cared what the poor little creature did, so she got money -- to lend to her. Lord Deerhurst is a particular friend of Lord Alvanley's -- having already given a bird's-eye view of the latter's character, no one will suppose him likely to choose a villain for his freind. I have no cause to vindicate the honour of Lord Deerhurst - but my own is implicated in it, as the house where he so often met Sophia, was as much, or more, mine than Miss Wilson's! - she always left me to pay the rent. His lordship, I believe, once said, when he heard I was under embarrassments, that I could work myself clear by using my pretty face: it was told to me by some busy-body; but I considered it the mere thoughtless expression of a man in his cups, not coming from the heart, and it made no alteration in my reception of him when we met. If his lordship reads this, it will be the first intimation he has had that I knew of his ungenerous, or unthinking expressions.

Sophia at first caught Lord Deerhurst's attention, when she was nearly fifteen years old, and had full as womanish an appearance as her sister near twenty. From a constant habit of Deerhurst attaching himself to her wherever she went, they both began to esteem each other; and Harriette, who had other views than that of kindling a mutual flame in their bosoms, all of a sudden wheeled round -- set her face against his, lordship's coming to our house, and painted him, as hideous to poor Sophia, whom a few months before she pourtrayed as an angel.

This mode of proceeding had a contrary effect to what she wished: they saw each other by stealth, and the little Sophia fancied herself miserable out of his presence.

*Harriette* always had some golden prospect in view. Since Amy had swindled *Count Palmella* out of his two hundred pounds, that nobleman had never noticed her; but to *Harriette* and myself he was very civil, and troubled us with a good deal of his company; in the course of which, I suspect that my lady found means to ease him of some "tribute money," for he was easily imposed upon.

He brought into our circle, the far-famed notorious Spanish Grandee *San Carlos*, whose name has often been execrated in the English Newspapers, for the seduction and abandonment of a young and lovely girl. Much as I have seen of mankind, this Grandee was the greatest profligate I ever had the misfortune to come in contact with. His wit was pointless, his talents were misapplied, and the numerous accomplishments he possessed, were employed for the most base and depraved purposes. He could destroy nature's finest work, and smilingly exult over the ruin he had made. *Harriette* kept the Don in play for some time; but at last he fixed his eyes upon Sophia, who, however, was not dazzled by his glittering exterior. Although he was splendid in his apparel; and his broad bow-windowed chest was decorated with ribbons, medals, and stars, like an embroiderer's shop before a court day, and he had a very handsome person withal, yet he failed to captivate the girl.

I had often lectured Sophia against Lord *Deerhurst*, and now set her on her guard against the Spanish Grandee.

God forgive me if I judge wrongfully, but I verily believe that *Harriette* had a plan in agitation, to betray her little sister, into the arms of this seductive foreigner.

Sophia often cried to me, and said, Harriette made her miserable respecting the Spaniard, whose warm advocate she was, and all I could say to assuage her emotions, was of no avail. *Harriette* pretended she would hook the Duke into a marriage with Sophia. She, however, knew mankind too well, even to entertain *seriously*, for a moment, so foolish an idea: But money she wanted, and money she would have, not caring how it came.

Sophia at length told me, that she feared some deep-laid plan was on foot, to hurry her off somewhere with the Duke; and the poor thing actually dreaded being sent on shipboard, and confined in the turrets of some old Moorish Castle in Spain.

Foolish as her fears were, Sophia had some cause for them, and Harriette made her life miserable; so that one Sunday she framed an excuse to go and visit her sister Amy. She went: - night came; - she returned not.- Morning dawned, but never more upon the virtuous Sophia: to avoid the accurst Spaniard, she chose the lesser evil, and threw herself into the arms of *Lord Deerhurst*.

Out of this event, has Miss Wilson made one of the most romantic tales in her *jest book*, but one which tells dreadfully against Lord Deerhurst. To proceed -- it was not long before his Lordship himself called, and acquainted us with the lamentable tale; adding, that Sophia was her own mistress, free to go, or remain under his protection, which she pleased. He would rather the last; but still, he would not persuade her, nor prevent her friends from using their influence, in any way they thought proper.

*Pour moi, j'avoue que le partie prend par milord, il me semble d'etre assez honnete;* so we all travelled off to assist the young fugitive. We found her far from sorry for the step she had taken, and resolved to remain with Lord Deerhurst.

I would not undertake to advise: before the event I had done all I could to forefend the blow; but now all was over, now the thing was irremediable, I saw the folly of retreating, and felt convinced had it not happened with Lord Deerhurst *now*, it might have hereafter, with one less able to take care of her, and he, to all appearances, was warmly attached to the imprudent creature.

God forbid, though peculiar circumstances have enrolled my name in the annals of guilt, that ever I should be its advocate, or become accessary to the ruin of others.

His Lordship took lodgings for her, as Miss Wilson truly says, near Hyde Park Corner; but it was so far from being the mean one she describes, that it was a first floor, every way becoming the mistress of a Peer.

We all dined, and spent the day with Sophia and his Lordship, when they commenced housekeeping. *Mrs. Debouchet*, the mother, never came near, though Harriette, to make her mother appear *something*, pretends she did. She was a shocking vulgar woman, very forward and coarse in her language; but her situation being so low in life, would be an ample excuse for her being, even, worse than she was.

The *meanness* attributed to Lord Deerhurst, I am inclined to believe, only existed in Harriette's fruitful imagination: he gave her a flat denial when she wanted to borrow money of him, and this accounts for her spite. He was in very good humour all day; and at Hamlet the jeweller's, purchased me a pretty silver tea-pot, as a mark of his regard for the kindness I had shewn to Sophia, who declared herself gratefully attached to me. Harriette, of course, envied me this present; and going along Coventry-street,
she asked him, in her winning way,

"My Deer-hurst, lend me twenty pounds till to-morrow."

"If I do, I'll be d--d," exclaimed the Peer

"Do you mean what you say, you brute?" murmured Harriette.

"Why, look'ye, *Harriette*," and here his Lordship, assumed a very serious face, "charity begins at home, I have few twenty pounds to spare; and now, all my overplus cash must go to Sophia, who has a real claim upon me. If I am generous to you, I must be unjust to her."

"No matter, no matter, *Sir*, I was not in earnest; but I am glad you thought I was, as it has let me see what a poor pitiful soul you are."

"On my soul I pity you; but love your sister so well, that I pardon your impertinence."

"Thank God I am not in poor Sophia's place!" rejoined Harriette, loosing my arm, and quitting us abruptly.

"Thank God you *are not*," echoed Lord Deerhurst, laughing aloud, as she joined Mr. Brummell, and drew him briskly down the Haymarket.

"I would have given her the cash," observed his Lordship to me, "but I will not encourage her profusion; she would, in an hour, have squandered it on little shoes - little caps - little watches - little lap-dogs - and then, the little devil, when she rose to-morrow, would not have a little sixpence left, to supply her little wants for the day." The humourous manner in which this was delivered, made even the little Sophia smile, who was, to continue the little figure of rhetoric, enjoying

> "Her little rule and little sway,
> A sunbeam on a summer's day."

Miss Harriette may take credit, for being correct, when she relates that Lord Deerhurst settled £300 per annum on Sophia; she ought, in justice, to have added, that Lord Alvanley influenced his friend to add the *odd hundred*: he was always doing some friendly action for his acquaintance. So handsome a settlement as three hundred speaks volumes, as to Lord Deerhurst's discriminating generosity; and if he were partial to dirt, as Harriette nastily avers, in this case at least he shewed no base partiality for dirty lucre.

The following letter may not be uninteresting to the friends of Lord Deerhurst, and those who love to see a character cleared from reproach.

It was sent to me after my first quarrel with Miss Wilson, when she went about town reporting, that I had betrayed her sister into the arms of Lord Deerhurst, for five hundred pounds.

    My dearest Julia ,

    Your letter did not surprise me in the least,
    for Harriette was a fibber from her childhood,
    and to obtain what she terms "just revenge,"
    would slander an angel. She well knows you
    were incapable of betraying me, and did all you
    could to save me from destruction.
    
    It was Harriette's conduct, by wishing to betray
    me to the Spaniard, that drove me to Deerhurst's
    arms: I can never forgive her. - I also
    acquit Lord Deerhurst of all blame: - he had
    made ardent love to me for six months, but never
    solicited me to elope with him. It was my own
    act to fly to him for protection. Do not fret:
    the most noble actions of the human mind are
    liable to be traversed by the designs of the
    wicked. Your's , affectionately,
    
    Oxford Street. S. D

After reading the above, which completely exonerates Lord Deerhurst and my humble self, from the foul charge of being *panders* of infamy, for the sake of vile lucre; will any one be surprised, that the amiable Countess of Berwick, after this, declined lending the reprobate *Harriette* a Guinea! How very right the Countess of Berwick was, in carefully abstaining from all correspondence with her sister, and by forming a resolution to keep aloof from her, may be seen. For had her Ladyship, through tenderness of heart, suffered herself to familiarize with Harriette, she would now have published her letters, with the facts distorted, and blazoned all her domestic secrets, embellished with the usual falsehoods.

She has said all she is able to say against her, which amounts only to a few vulgar tales, that no one can believe; and it redounds to the Countess's credit, that she has called forth the spleen of one whose approbation would destroy the character of any honest woman.

Miss Wilson and her publisher must have been hard driven for materials to fill up the chasms left in *their book*, by the characters of those who have been foolish enough to pay for having their names expunged. For example, when she details Lord Fred Bentinck's speech at Sir Murray Maxwell's electioneering dinner, she could have it only from hearsay, or the newspapers, for neither she, or any of her coterie were at that dinner, though the speech is manufactured by *the pair*, and printed in the same flippant style as all the other trash of her Memoirs. But the whole is a lying fabrication of Harriette's fertile invention, *fitted up* by her ugly publisher and his crew.

----

I must now dilate a little on the alleged intrigues of the Duke of Wellington, if they are worthy of the name, even admitting them to be as Harriette states.

First, it will not be amiss to relate what I know of Harriette's friend, the procuress, in Berkeley-street, who, she says, was instrumental in introducing her to the Duke. This exposition must be amusing, and may be made instructive. This woman was about fifty years old, of an agreeable temper, and conciliating manners; her face bore the remains of beauty, her figure was fine and she was every way calculated to wind herself into the secret recesses of the human heart. I knew her three years as a friend of the Wilson's, without being acquainted with her profession. She was a native of Scotland, and had, in her youthful days, been under the protection of His Grace the Duke of ---- I won't tell who, because his numerous descendants are all honourable men, and women too. When his grace died he left her £1000. and no more, because he had long suspected her wandering from his fold into that of General Sir James Pulteney. The eclat this woman had gained as mistress to the man, whom Mr. Pitt, "the heavenborn Minister," called "the stumbling block of administrations," soon got her a fresh amorous engagement.

Lord Camelford, who was afterwards shot by *Best*, placed her in lodgings in Bond-street, and for three years her face was familiar *sur la pave*, and she was, moreover, a universal toast. Her dress was an extraordinary one: - a navy blue habit, trimmed with gold; - large gold epaulets, and anchor buttons innumerable! A post captain in every thing but breeches. At the death of Lord Camelford she found herself adrift in the world, without a friend.

His Lordship, used to kill his men, expected to do the same by Best, and it never entered into his head to make a will, so *Miss Thwaites* was left to try the usual female resources for a living.

She passed from high to low, never remaining long with one, not even pretending to constancy. Sir Harry Vane and Lord Delaval, were said to have been the most bountiful of her admirers; and it was the last mentioned nobleman who, just before he married his house-keeper, fitted up for her a house in Denmark-street, Soho, and made her a present of one thousand pounds. Here she took in boarders, - "single gentlemen," but this proved a poor speculation; so to enliven the dreary winter evening, she admitted single ladies also. Her house soon became notorious , and masquerades were planned by her, and executed by subscription. They took place once a month, and were attended by all the beaux and belles in town, who set no value upon their reputation, or rather got *value received* for throwing it away.

Miss Thwaites was very extravagant, and in process of time was arrested, and confined in Newgate, where she came out by an act for the relief of insolvents. 

When released, she had a few pounds left, and attached herself to a Lieutenant in a marching regiment; his name was "Beale," one who had attained an infamous celebrity, on account of seducing two girls, and promising them both marriage: it is needless to say he broke his faith, and they were both compelled to go on the town for support.

She now assumed the name of *Mrs. Beale*, and successfully swindled numerous tradesmen in her keeper's name. A trip to Ireland, where Beale's regiment was stationed, saved her from prosecution.

On her return to London she was too well known to be trusted; whilst her paramour Mr. Beale, in his attempts at "Raising the wind," did something which was not much to his credit as an officer and a gentleman. I forbear to say what, as the man is still in town , living with another mistress or wife, and making, I am told, the appearance of an honest though scanty living, by keeping a chandler's shop, or something like it. No matter, when Mr. Beale was dismissed from the army, this *lady* resolved to try her fortunes alone.

My informant gives me a long list of her transactions, as a procuress in many parts of the Metropolis, and among other matters asserts, that it was owing to her vile machinations that the famous Jane Best was seduced, or more properly speaking, forcibly ruined by Sir Edmund Porter.

Mrs. Esten, who long held the heart of the late Duke of Hamilton in thrall, carried on her intrigues at the mansion of Mrs. Beale. But these things I feel no pleasure in dwelling on; and I only repeat this woman's history, in order to shew that Harriette Wilson worked, in all her ways, with the most vicious instruments.

Mrs. Beale that was, took the name of Porter, from a Serjeant-Major in the Horse Guards, who officiated as her bully and her husband. The late Duke of Queensbury constantly employed mother Porter, and as a reward, he made her a present of the lease of the house in Berkeley street.

Here it was that His Grace hobbled to look at the unfortunate [Lady Emma Lyons Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma,_Lady_Hamilton), to whom he left a legacy of ten thousand pounds. The name of Mrs. Porter stands in his Grace's will for £10,000 but the legacies are safe in chancery, and the old lady *lives in hopes*.

With this notorious woman, Harriette lived on terms of the closest intimacy; and betwixt them, I doubt not, many a man was fleeced of his money. I have no reason to disbelieve her account of General Walpole, and the hoax put upon him, by sending an old lady to represent the young one: it is precisely a trick suited to her complexion; for Harriette loved a good joke, even though she lost her friend by carrying it into practice. She possessed a considerable portion of humour, and could perform "High life below stairs" *au merveille*. It would be a folly, as well as an act of injustice in me, to deny her great accomplishments. To have been admitted merely into the company of so many of the first men of the age, is good proof, that she must have possessed the *knack of pleasing* in a high degree. With her own sex she was not at home: her manners were too bold, and her temper overbearing; she envied every other woman; and her sister Amy she hated, because *her* admirers were as numerous as her own.

If nature ever formed an agent for vicious purposes alone, it was her. She was fitted for the part she acted in the drama of life, and no other. As a demirep of fashion, at the period I allude to, she stood without a rival, supreme goddess in the temple of profligacy!

That Mrs. Porter received one hundred guineas to get Harriette introduced to the Duke of Wellington, I am aware is a fact; it is no discredit to his Grace, in particular, seeing so many of his compeers and other fellows, were actuated by the same spirit of curiosity.

Yet, has she indulged in most illiberal sarcasms against the Duke, to whom she ought, at least, to have bowed in silent gratitude: she was never refused from twenty to fifty pounds, whenever she asked it; and the donation was generally accompanied by good advice, such as no one could have expected to come from a soldier, bred in camps, and, albeit , ill practised in sentiments of pity or of love.

At one time, Harriette took it into her head, that she had as much influence over the Duke's mind, as a certain, now forgotten demirep, presumed to have over an illustrious personage; and, contrary to my earnest advice and remonstrances, she made an application to him, *in his official capacity*, to bestow, or procure a commission for Serjeant Major Porter, the man already mentioned as *le procureur* in Berkeley-street. The reply to her improper request, was to the following purport, according to my transcript made at the time: -

        Strathfieldsay.
    
    Miss Harry,

    I had just prepared for a shooting excursion, when your letter came and spoiled my sport. I know not what sort of an opinion you must have formed of me, to make such a silly application as your letter conveys. The man for whom you require my influence, is a bad character, and were he a good one, I could receive no testimonials in his favour from *you*; whatever I can oblige you in as a *private gentleman*, I have always been ready to do, more than becomes me; but let me never hear from you again on any thing that concerns my military capacity, for I never will suffer private friendship to interfere with my public duties. As a proof that I am not offended, and that I believe you only erred from want of thought, I enclose a cheque for double the sum you ask, and beg you to economize a little
    
    Yours,
    DECIMUS.

Such was the signature always used by his Grace; for what reason I know not. This letter, if not very sensibly written, was severe enough; and, to add to its poignancy , when his grace retured to town, he behaved more distantly than formerly.

I come now to one of those scenes in which I have been exhibited in caricature of the grossest kind, in most of the low print shops in town. The works in which this shew has been made, are, it is true, of the very meanest kind, and, I am proud, and happy to say, that in the windows of booksellers of respectability, no such picture has been exposed.

From page 87 to 90 of her work , (I mean the miniature edition, sold at 252, Holborn) Miss Harriette indulges in a detail of bed-room scenery, very few will read with pleasure. It relates to Colonel Cotton's being hid under my bed, in the apartments at Hampton Court, and my introducing my sister into it, to strip and expose herself, she being unconscious that any eye but mine could see her.

Thus to have exposed innocence, would merit my being called even as base as Harriette Wilson. Those readers, who compare and reflect on what they read, may turn to the commencement of these confessions, at page 10, and there they will read, that my mother and myself parted finally, when I came to Hampton Court; and yet does Harriette *bring her in* as coming to my bed-room, and kissing me before I fell asleep, and other such trash; but she seems to have forgotten, that my mother's abode was *at another place*, from which I was sent at a very early period, for refusing to learn German. As to my sister, I have never mentioned her, nor ever will sully her purity, by an introduction to those, (myself included) unworthy of her society, even on paper.

If a long career of vice, has made Harriette so completely the hardened reprobate, as to expose for lucre, those related to her by nature's closest ties, it has a contrary effect upon me. That *one* should be *lost*, is sufficiently painful and degrading to a family, without implicating others who do not merit it.

So much in defence of myself; and now for *a man*, to whose friendship I readily acknowledge myself indebted, for a favour with which the reader has no occasion to be acquainted, as it was of a domestic nature, and unknown to Harriette Wilson.

----

I will not tire the readers patience with a repetition of Amy's *patting* story, so unadroitly told in "the Memoirs;" he may find it by opening the book at page 91.

Mr. Hart Davis was a good easy man, and he knew Amy from her having accompanied me, when I called upon him about this very business. He was ever a man of tranquil domestic virtue, and the service he rendered me, was entirely from the friendship he bore from his youth to my family; but he deplored and censured my conduct, with candour, with freedom, and severity.

I feel no hesitation in saying, that he never entered Amy's doors, and so particular was he about appearances, that he never walked in public, even with me.

Amy must have *patted* the hundred pounds out of some fool's pocket. As to Mr. Davis he was over wise to be the dupe of profligacy.

Harriette's first interview with the Duke of Wellington, took place in our drawing-room. I retired as he entered, though he politely entreated me to remain. Nothing *improper* could take place on the occasion; for his grace knew I overheard their conversation. He talked much common place stuff, saying some very kind, and some very foolish things, fit for woman's ear alone, much as Harriette has related. I give the devil his due.

The raillery about the rat-catcher is also to the point. The Duke put up with any thing; and from long observation, he preferred being made a butt of, to seeing another worried. I have observed, when Harriette has been roasting my brother till he was quite unhappy-for he could not stand being *cut up* in company, that the Duke has purposely drawn the lady's flippant tongue upon himself.

In page 99 of the 'Memoirs', Harriette treats us with a letter from the Duke of Argyle ; she has altered and spoilt it to suit her own purposes: fortunately for the cause of truth, I have a copy of it in my common-place book, with which I here favour the public.

Harriette was always writing to the Duke, as he had given her permission; and this time, for a wonder, she did not ask for money.

    Inverary Castle.
    ****** As to loving you, that is as you say, "almost out of the question." I have found much pleasure in your society. When a man is inclined to lay aside the dignity of his nature, and become a trifler, he cannot have a fitter plaything than Harriette: perhaps she has the same opinion relative to Argyle; but I am contented to be thought any thing you please. Youare not so handsome as you imagine -- Scotia's rustic damsels would out-rival your *artificial* roses, by a display of their *natural* ones. My gardener's daughter would be a beauty, even in the eyes of your ugly delineator, George Brummell. The Scotch pebbles you wish, and properly call "cairn goram," are found on a mountain of that name, but not on my estate, as you suppose; but I send you some equally as brilliant -- my jeweller will have them cut and set for you. I am glad you have so many admirers, and wish you could secure one. The winter of your days must come at last lay in fuel for it in time .

    Your's truly,
    A. B. B.

This is the trifling of a man of fashion - very indifferent to the person he addresses; and the conclusion of the letter proves, that Harriette had not the love of Argyle as she so often boasted. Many wished to see her settled as well as his grace.

I do not give Harriette's reply, not because I dictated it, but because it was equally as foolish as that she has studied and substituted in its place. I am not always wise - nor prudent.

----

## A Dinner Party.
The dinner [ vide page 110 of Memoirs] has made some noise in the world. It is true, that "poor Julia was not invited." I *lacked face* to intrude every where! but I remember well, that it was considered a high honour to meet the Earl of Yarmouth, the friend of the Prince; and for some days after, Harriette bored me with a repetition of what passed. But here again she has committed a wilful lapse of memory.

She observed to me, "That Croker is a cursed proud fellow -- he called just as dinner was serving up, and talked over some trifling business, about a midshipman he was sending to sea for his lordship. He scarce deigned to bow when Yarworth introduced us."

"You will stay dinner," said his lordship.

"No, indeed; my wife has a home party and I am expected to carve;" at the same time, said Harriette, he cast upon us a supercilious look, which plainly said —

    "I don't like your company."

"He was a poet and a politician," said Harriette, "and I wished him to have remarked somewhat, that I might have sounded the depth of his understanding, and made some sport. He appeared possessed of all the fidgettyness of genius."

Harriette held up Croker for this reason -- he was a married man, and she hoped to set his lady and him at variance; and he had looked upon her pretty face with indifference -- a heinous crime in her eyes; but *chacun à son gre* — every man to his taste.

In page 112 are inserted some verses - "The Physician's Prayer to Eolus." They were written by her and I, in conjunction, and are very bad; the fact is, she was ambitious to be thought a poetess, and frequently *produced* sonnets and odes to her own beauty, which she had copied in various hands, signed with names of exalted persons, and handed them about to excite envy amongst her female acquaintance.

Mr. Street, formerly proprietor of the Courier Newspaper, we met at sundry times, was an agreeable man, and jested with us upon equal terms. But he had no *penchant* for Fanny, as asserted, or any one else that I ever observed. Harriette imagined every one that looked upon her was in love with her. *L'amour propre* has been the curse of the poor vain creature from the first to the last, as her Memoirs make manifest.

Partial to grovelling in dirt, she accuses Lord Lowther, as she had done Lord Deerhurst, of uncleanliness in his person; but she is the only person I ever heard make the observation. Of young Mr. Graham, whom she mentions several times for *bad* and *good*, I know just enough to say that she speaks truth.

My passions, she declares, were violent and unmanageable; but there never was a greater untruth put upon paper; for, thank Heaven! I never wanted self-controul. I have related sincerely the reason why I parted with Colonel Cotton, and yet she would have the reader believe that it was owing to her interference.

Again, Lord Carysfort never loaded me with reproaches. When I had occasion to apply to him, he replied with reserve, bordering on taciturnity. I never troubled him, except for explanations upon family affairs - his answers satisfied me, and that is enough.

My little income had, long previous to these applications to Lord Carysfort, been encumbered so much, that I accounted it nearly lost. I had all the household expenses to pay, and I also paid the rent. Our wine bill came upon me, and it was not a small one - we saw so much gay company.

I had, very foolishly, the reader will allow, flattered myself with getting married; and once I could have met a match with a very pleasant man - but I scorned deception, and made him acquainted with my having a large family. He would even then, I believe, have married me, but his parents, on whom he was totally dependant, gave him a positive refusal.

I often think with esteem upon George Rider. Colonel Sydenham was put in my way by my worthy brother; they belonged to the same regiment. He was truly a soldier, and "woo'd a woman," as King Richard says, "A lion woo's his bride." I was wearied with his bold impertinence, and happily Amy succeeded in entangling him in her net. She assumed his name; and he made a settlement upon her she neither merited from her constancy or disposition. I was indifferent to most men, and strove to conquer that indifference for the sake of my children; though, Heaven knows, I had suffered enough in my early attachment to convince me that

    "Not to admire is of all means the best,
    "The only course to make and keep us blest."

Harriette speaks very honestly of Freeling, of the Post-office; he was too good for our society. She concludes "he had the good heart to do me an essential service some months afterwards, when I believed he had forgotten me altogether."

Now, can this woman have any false delicacy?

No - but she is a hypocrite: and hypocrisy is a homage (as I have read) which vice renders to virtue.

She could not candidly own that she was arrested on Westminster Bridge, for a tavern bill of large amount, which she suffered to be placed to her account at the Southampton Arms, Camden Town, where she treated a cousin of her's, young Mordaunt of the Guards - since 'provided for' at Waterloo. Freeling happening to witness the transaction, *en passent au cheval*, he stopt and attended her to the spunging-house in Saint Martin's Lane, where he first bailed her out, and afterwards paid the debt.

----

Notwithstanding the frequent sleights she has thought proper to put upon me, it gives me real pleasure when I find Harriette committing an error in her Memoirs, and involuntarily doing homage to generous actions in other people. I was in the room when the Duke of Wellington called to bid her adieu: - he set out for Spain that night.

They both wept. The account may be seen in her Memoirs, at page 31 of Benbow's edition. The Duke ever to me appeared more like a father watching over the interests of his child, than a lover devoting his attention to a mistress, - a species of kindness she requited in her usual manner, by ridiculing her benefactor. Harriette frequently observed, when reflecting on his folly, *C'est un grande sottise la.* I was sorry to think so; and this interview convinced me that he could not have been moved as he was, if his heart had not been more tender than the world allows. May I die if I don't think him both kind and amiable. *C'est assez pour achever le portrait.*

A filthy story is Harriette Wilson's supreme delight -- to wallow in the mire of indecency, is to her and her Caliban of the Colonade, a mental luxury.

The Honourable Mrs. Nesbit, with whom she relates having travelled in France, has been honoured with a place in the filthiest corner of her book. The story may be found in her Memoirs at page 143 of the diamond edition. I dare not venture upon it; but for the honour of my sex hope every male reader will believe as I do, -- that it is all *fudge*.

There was, and there is now, residing near one of the principal squares, a lady of this name. Harriette got introduced to her table as a married woman, through some queer contrivance of Sir Joseph Nourse's and the lady for several weeks shewed her particular attention. But, oh! dire disclosure! what sad disgrace attends our endeavours to fight under false colours! She was one morning standing at the corner of Percy Street, talking to the good lady, when who should come up to them but Captain Foley, one of her
admirers - he slapped her on the back.

"Hey, my little piece, where the devil have you been hiding your pretty face these three weeks? 'Pon my soul you look pale - fretting as if you had been sleeping alone; by the way, there's a masquerade to-night, where there'll be the devil to pay; won't you come?" She succeeded at length, by winks and nods, to stop his loquacity; but Mrs. Nesbit's suspicions were awakened, and she made inquiry as to the real character of her new acquaintance. The result of which was, her doors were closed upon Harriette before she had an opportunity of practising the old trick of borrowing money.

I somehow think this is the same lady whom she has transported into France, and loaded with the scum of her filthy narrative. If it is the lady there meant, she is far superior to any thing Harriette Wilson could blame her with.

To prove that this Miss Harriette's imagination *gallops*, whilst her judgment moves at a *foot* pace, take the following: - *Dans l'art d'interessegre consiste l'art de bien ecrire*. I know not if I have acquired this tact -- it is not from study, at any rate ; a true woman, I strive to get into my story as quickly as possible, *but as often fail in the endeavour*.

I recollect - so do you, I dare say, dear reader, if you are at all acquainted with *bon ton*, if not, you have no occasion to read my confessions - they won't interest you. When Lady Beresford fell a victim to the Earl of Bective, Miss Harriette Wilson had found means to get squeezed into the earl's acquaintance. This young man, with all his lightness, when pursuing his amours, had a heart - but he seldom applied to it as a direction for his actions. He heard Harriette's fictitious tales, and pitied her. When the trial was over, and the lady thrown out of the pale of honourable society, she withdrew into retirement: and Harriette, whose conduct in life they carefully concealed, was introduced to her ladyship as an agreeable companion. This was done with the best intentions. Harriette pretended she languished to be restored to the paths of virtue; and the lady's melancholy was fast overpowering her reason there was no remedy but *smiling* her into her own good opinion; and Harriette had certainly a bewitching method of making any one jocund against their inclination.

Harriette remained two months with the lady, and became a great favourite. Her usual habits prevailed, and she longed for the publicity St. James's Street affords, and the gaze of fools at an opera or a play. She accordingly gave notice to Lady B., that she should return to her friends. The noble earl, who had supposed she really was sincere in her promises of amendment, hereupon gave up every hope of reformation.

To be virtuous, required an effort stronger than she could make; and her mind, devoid of force, yielded again to its natural depravity. She was sent away laden with gifts; and the first thing she did was to turn her benefactors into ridicule, and spread abroad the most malicious stories.

Her acquaintances with *milliners* and dressmakers was extensive, and what she related to them soon spread through families by means of their servants. It was not enough that Lady B. had suffered in a court of justice, and was lost to the world - but Harriette reported she was grossly sensual, and in the country had met a lover in a *certain place* in the garden, not to be named, except by a *Harriette Wilson*. The person she accused with making such an appointment was a married man. Ultimately it was contrived by some friends, to bring him and his accuser face to face, before Lady B---, when she was compelled to acknowledge her infamy, and to avoid an action for defamation, signed a paper, acknowledging herself a liar and a slanderer. Thus has all her days been divided between frivolous pursuits and barbarous inflictions. Such a character may be compared to the allusion in the fable, where those are represented with a double wallet; the forward part, containing their neighbours' faults, whilst their own are slung unseen, behind their backs.

An accusation of a similar nature, she made against the Countess of Antrim, and then abjectly begged for mercy.

The Hon. Berkeley Craven was partial to her, and hearing of the above - mentioned transactions, he cut the connection, saying that "no man was safe with such a vile creature."

Every person has some prevailing passion, and hers was to speak ill of those who acted *well* towards her. How base! She accuses Lord Deerhurst of two acts, which would disgrace any felon out of Newgate: namely, *imposture* and *forgery*. She insidiously brings in Mr. Luttrell's name, as if to corroborate her story, well knowing that none would believe her on her bare word. See page 96 vol. ii. of her Memoirs. Glass beads, and brass seals were given (she there avows) to Sophia by Lord Deerhurst as valuable jewels; and she makes his lordship accuse himself of having caused Robinson, an attorney, to draw up "an agreement to secure Sophia an annuity of three hundred a year, which was not worth sixpence."

I know of myself, and have the authority of the person principally interested, for declaring these accusations totally devoid of foundation. Sophia was not such an idiot as to mistake brass for gold, and the annuity she actually enjoyed until an important change in her situation rendered it improper for her to hold what she no longer wanted. It was relinquished with grace, and reverted back to its paymaster with good feeling on both sides.

*Apropos d'argent*: I may as well comment here, on her false account of the proffered Ponsonby annuity. "Ponsonby," mercy on me, how many lies has she made that name cover! I don't know whether to laugh or be serious . It is of little consequence, for of all the stories Harriette ever fabricated, this is the chief; the palladium of her *inventions*, and merits her a place by the side of Baron Munchausen. Oh! words, produce of ideas, the man who went by that name, was the balloonist, Captain Sowden, he was the boldest liar I ever knew. I remember when he sailed through the skies; or, as mother Piozzi would call it, "a wilderness of suns," with Garnerin; he published an account of his aerial voyage, and, among other marvellous stories, said "Blackheath appeared about the size of a gooseberry bush, and I could distinctly perceive the cattle and men and women grazing upon it."

Now, this was the man, above all others, likely to suit Harriette's ideas, and she formed an acquaintance with him, which terminated in her appropriating one of his Navy bills for £40 to her own use, and merely leaving a notice that she *considered it due to her for services rendered*. Our *Munchausen* Captain met her after this, in Oxford-street, and gave her in charge to the watch. She returned the compliment , and they both slept in durance vile for a night. Next morning, a compromise took place. She travelled home to her paramours of the day, and Sowden, minus forty pounds, went to sea.

## PONSONBY AND WILSON, THE ROMANCE OF A DEMIREP.

    "Foul lies can only leave a stain,
    And these are phantoms of the brain."

Ye, who listen with admiration, to the tales of other times, and gaze with idiotic rapture on the pictures of love, drawn by the erratic pencil of meandering fancy. Ye , who lost in thought, steep your senses in oblivion, and enjoy a dreamless night of long repose. Awake, arise, attend! A scene opens on your view, never before contemplated: the glorious conjunction of Winter and Summer; the criss-cross meeting of Mars and Venus. The planets cease to wheel in their orbs. The stars grow dim in their sphere. *Truth* and *hope* fly up to *heaven*. *Nature* shrinks; and over a slumbering world the goddess of Fiction waving her airy wand, rouses slander from her den; *rumour* with her thousand tongues, bursts from her cave; *curiosity* bends forward with inquisitive looks, and *malignity* with eye-balls flashing the living fire, stands in anxious expectation to hear the vision of a demoniac's brain, calculated to sow discord on the soil of harmony, break the bands of married felicity, and stamp with immortal infamy, the name of Harriette Wilson!

Poor Robert Burns says in his poems,

    "Some books are lies from end to end,
    And some great lies were never penned."

It is very true ; and what is a work of consequence, whether an Illiad, an Odyssey, or the "Memoir of a Harlot," without an Episode! Nothing, absolutely nothing.

I once heard Dr. Parr say, that the apocrypha formed a kind of Episode in the bible. Now, Miss Harriette Wilson, having treated us with *scan.* *mag.* beyond all reason , found her book flag in its sale; and by the advice of some scribbler, as foolish, and as egotistical as Jack Stockdale, that knight of the rueful countenance; she resolved to relieve it with a tale of sentimental love, one that might draw tears from the fountain of feeling, and shade with affliction the face of sensibility.

Oh, dear me! What say the world? How very unjust to tax women of pleasure, with having no heart to dispose of! Look to Harriette Wilson's Memoirs, and sigh over the pathetic pages, detailing the miseries springing from *pure love*, having taken up its abode in the bosom, which never before beat but with voluptuous depravity. Gentle readers, tender souls, when you have done sighing over fiction, listen to the words of truth.

Harriette Wilson never was connected with LORD PONSONBY, and never spoke to him above twenty times in her life.

I declare it upon my good faith, I am ready to ratify it by the solemn sanction of an oath; and I can bring others than myself to swear the same.

Reader, excuse my wayward rambling, in bringing about this grand *denouement* - I know not how to treat it appropriately; nor which to admire most, Harriette Wilson's impudence, or her contempt for public opinion. No doubt the *romance* of Ponsonby was written to extort money as a bribe for withholding, or in hopes of reward for *flattery* of his lordship's person; and the scheme having failed, it was so served up to the meretricious part of the public, in order to prove the writer a tender-hearted creature.

Harriette knew that his Lordship would scorn to notice her *printed* slanders, as he had *hitherto* her *verbal* ones; and therefore, concluded *the romance* would be swallowed as truth by a *gaping world*, ever ready to believe in the marvelous and sentimental, when it comes from a *female pen*.

The thing which gave rise to a correspondence of some continuance between *Lord Ponsonby* and *Harriette Wilson*, was a concern in which her brother was deeply implicated.

Lord Ponsonby first saw her at our house, where he called one evening, when he was very tipsey, in company with the Duke of Argyle, and I forget who besides, formed the party. He selected *Harriette* for his friend, and till twelve at night talked her into the belief, that he was really smitten with her charms.

There are few men who give a greater latitude to speech, than Lord Pensonby, when he is half-seas over; but in his steady senses, he is remarkably taciturn and distant to disagreeableness. In our society (of course, I mean not the most refined in the world) when his Lordship came in a morning, which was very seldom, he was quite the modest gentleman; but what he came for, was this: Harriette Wilson's brother had been in the commissariat of the army, and by upright conduct, I believe, rose tolerably high in his post. Unfortunately he came to London, on half pay; he had then made a little fortune, say ten thousand pounds or thereabout. Being very partial to his sister, he lavished more money on her in extravagance, than most men do on their mistresses. She had no feeling for him, and when he chose to spend money, she never attempted to control him. He was a very elegant young man, both in person and manners; his mind agreeably stored with a great variety of information.

His servitude abroad for years, had given him a good knowledge of the world; but his school education favoured him little or nothing, besides reading, writing and accounts: - In the latter, he was an adept, but rather effeminate in his general demeanour; he would have passed his time among the ladies very differently from his brother, the major, who was manly, open hearted, and free, much readier to censure his sister for her faults than throw away money to pamper her frivolous disposition. The major, indeed, was of a piece with my own brother, and they also were great friends.

Two years of folly, left this young man (the commissary) destitute of resources, and solely dependant on his trifling half pay for a scanty subsistence. This I well knew from certain pecuniary transactions of a humiliating nature, that several times came under my own observation, when to my great surprise, he took a large house near one of the fashionable squares, launched a barouche, and made Harriette sit at the head of his table, *comme Maitresse*.

I made no attempt to elucidate this singular transaction, well aware, that an explanation would be conclusive, *mais peu satisfactoire; car, une femme qui cherisse des soupcons d'etre trompu, n'est convanicu par des sermens, meme, du partie interesse.*

Most of Amy's friends now deserted her, and Harriette's became the rallying point for all dashing beaux and belles of *the West end*.

The thing palpably would not last; but for a time, it had an effect, for which, I presume it was intended.

A nobleman in an exalted station, but whose name I shall not mention (because I am not quite positive it was he who accomplished the business) procured *young Wilson*, (let us call him) an appointment of trust and great emolument. It would have been wise after this, had the Wilsons laid down their carriage and returned to a less expensive mode of living; -- but Harriette could not endure the idea of retrogading one step, though advancing led to certain destruction . A momentary triumph, was to her worth sacrifices of weeks of pain and future humiliation. She never could, at least would not, look, or think, beyond the day that was passing over her head, and some thoughtless things, I had recently caught myself doing, rendered me unfit to give advice, much less to remonstrate: I seemed to have stood in need of advice myself, on such occasions.

The employment of young Wilson, was almost a sinecure, he had short journies to make once a month, to the Sea-Ports and Scotland, where he paid away considerable sums of money. Thither Harriette and a male and female friend generally accompanied him, and a carriage and servants were sported where a single horse was only necessary, and would have been more becoming in the person who bore the expence, and had to bear the future shame.

The appearance of Mr. Wilson's equipage and mode of living, excited a little *curiosity* in his superiors; and a few errors in his accounts made them keep a sharper look out after him, than had been usual. One night, I had retired to rest about twelve, when my bell rung in a peculiar manner, which was well understood betwixt Harriette and myself. I dressed again and went down to let her in; she rushed into my arms, and I bore her into the drawing room, where she fainted away.

I had never seen her thus agitated, nor display so much feeling; and participated in her alarm, without being able to guess the cause. A *cordial* revived her spirits, and she looked round in fearful anxiety, exemplifying the words of our immortal Bard:

    "The thief thinks every bush an officer."

"Harriette! my dear Harriette? *dites moi votre malheur*, tell me the sense of this singular appearance and your evident distress; probably I can console you."

"Never," she replied, franticly clasping her hands together and grinding her teeth. "George is arrested for forgery; and will I fear destroy himself to-night."

"Ah, *le malhereux*, thought I; *mais, on ne faut tuer soi-meme qui doit d'etre pendue.*"

Notwithstanding this temporary levity, my concern for her made me almost as ill as herself, and but for my maid's assistance, I had sunk to the carpet.

As I do not wish to make a book of volumes, merely to suit such men as your Stockdales and other harpies of the press, I decline relating, how many hysterical fits, how many faintings, and how many sleeping draughts and cordials, were passed to bring the afflicted lady to a calm and dispassionate sense of her miserable state, as regarded her brother. He was not (it turned out) actually under an arrest for forgery, but had been examined before the Lords of the Treasury; when his accounts were found in such an *embarrassed* state, that he had been placed in military durance; that is, a sentinel to guard his movements in barracks, at Knightsbridge, Portman-square, or somewhere else near at hand.

The two days following Harriette's midnight ramble, were occupied in visiting this thoughtless or deluded brother; and things turned out so unfavourable, that a *moonshine* removal took place, from the fine house they had occupied; and in a few hours, plate, horses, carriages, and every thing moveable were converted into cash.

They were not, however, deeply in debt to their tradesmen; but the Government were preparing to lay an embargo, by way of Exchequer process, on the property; and we know every one deems it excuseable, if not praiseworthy, to get to windward of Government. At least, such was the argument advanced in extenuation of the present rapid *movement*.

Harriette had now an occasion to try the sincerity of her friends, who had always been so lavish of promises, and though I penned upwards of fifty letters, and she made as many visits to her closest acquaintances, none of them would step forward to rescue her unhappy brother from his critical situation. They all made excuses. Lord Yarmouth bluntly said "he thought the youth deserved hanging, and he would not stop the course of justice *if he could*." Lord Lowther said, he had no interest at head quarters; adding, for reason , his father made government a present of a line-of-battle-ship, *on paper*, which was never built; and, unless he fulfilled the contract, he believed they would not make an exciseman on his recommendation.

The Duke of Argyle could not interfere, "because the party was not a Scotchman," - had no Burgh interest I suppose. Lord Alvanley remarked, "that if he had any interest at court, he would have employed it in aid of himself, long ago; for he thought himself possessed of capabilities sufficient to make a very decent ambassador at a petty German court," but nobody else thought Pepper Arden capable even of this.

The Duke of Wellington, as he had before done on the occasion of Marshal Ney's *appel au capitulation de Paris*, declared "he would not meddle with any thing concerning the government, as to points of law, justice, or mercy." In short, the result of Harriette's applications reminded me, forcibly, of the strong moral lesson conveyed in John Gay's fable of "the Hare and many friends."

Unknown to her, and when she was lying on a sick bed, I made bold to apply to Lord Ponsonby: he readily promised to use his little influence, and when, upon enquiry, he found there was more imprudence than guilt in the young man's conduct, he resolutely determined to do his utmost to serve him. For three weeks the case was suspended in the balance of doubt; and Lord Ponsonby came to us, every week, with some account of his hopes and fears.

The event was, that young Wilson got once more reduced to *half pay*, and found it necessary, when discharged from his military confinement, to embark, at once, in a ship bound to the West Indies.

Through my influence with Lord Ponsonby, this was brought about; and I have heard, that had things been pushed to extremities, the young culprit would have expiated his offences, in a manner, not very honourable, but in which many of the Wilsons had done before him.

One would suppose, that this good deed of mine, might have flashed across Harriette's recollection, when she was whetting her pen to slander me in her indecent pages. It is probable, she is unwilling to remember, falling on her knees, and calling me the saviour of her family, when I announced to her the young man's release, and presented her with a purse containing fifty guineas, to forward him on his way over the seas. Oh, no: her enmities are engraven on brass or in marble; - her gratitude is written in dust, and dispelled by the gentlest wind.

This is a true account of all the particular intimacy, that existed betwixt my quondam friend Harriette and Lord Ponsonby. They did, indeed, meet at our house sundry times, and I recollect her calling upon him at the House of Lords, for a letter concerning the business just alluded to.

So far was his lordship desirous of a close intimacy with Harriette, that I have before me a note from her, written in reply to one she had sent, requesting a private interview, that she might express her gratitude for all his favours.

> Pall Mall, Saturday.
> Miss Wilson,
> That I have done your brother some service, gives me real pleasure; for I really believe he was, comparatively, innocent of the charge of falsyfying his accounts. You, perhaps, my giddy young friend, were more to blame than your brother.
>
> There is no good in your personally thanking me for what I deem a duty, to assist a fellow creature in distress; besides, as the hey-day of my blood is not over, I am unwilling to trust myself alone with so enchanting a creature as every one declares Harriette is. I am married, and happily the consequences of our meeting, if ever so harmless, would be interpreted against me, and if it reached the ears of Lady P--- make her miserable, and that I would not do for the world. Let this be the last of our correspondence, now the business is settled which began it; unless you want my services more particularly, indeed, and then I would rather you would apply through your good friend Julia, with whose family I am nearly connected. Adieu, and believe me,
>  
> Your's, faithfully,
> PONSONBY.

This is, perhaps, the letter Harriette asserts she destroyed, saying, that it contained the promise of a settlement. I cannot conceive how such stories could be imagined by her. The cause of her long illness I could easily account for, and *Dr. Merriman*, whom she so wantonly redicules, can, if he chooses, tell what particular disorder afflicted her. *Dr. Bankhead* also knows that the disease was in body, and not in mind, I cannot be more explicit on such an occasion. 

Now, I will ask Harriette a question, which, as I take care she shall see this work, she possibly may answer, though not truly.

"Did you not, early in January, apply to Lord Ponsonby for three hundred pounds, with a hint that if he did not comply, you would hang him up in effigy in a forthcoming publication."

"And, did you not, upon his refusal, write to her ladyship, and enclose a copy of all you have published in the "Memoirs?" concluding your letter thus, "the publication will *disgrace him*, and *cause you* to be *laughed at in all companies, for family reasons*; it is worth twice the money to hush it up, and you *may depend* on my secrecy, if *I am honourably dealt with.*"

This letter was dated Canterbury, and Miss Wilson was then actually at that city, waiting replies to many other letters of an extortionate nature. I can convict her of falsehoods, even by her own hand writing; and so much is she in dread of me, that since I commenced publishing these confessions, I have had overtures of peace made to me, from her, through Mr. Charles Hemley, her particular friend; for there are certain friendships her marriage has not yet dissolved.

A letter of her's from Paris, to Mr. Simpson, of Marchmont-street, Burton Crescent, and now in my possession, it is no matter how I came by it, — says —

"I will pay £150 of your account *off*, some day in march, and the remainder by installments at the times agreed upon, between you and *Gibson*. My book has sold well; far beyond our expectations, but I get more for *suppressing* than *publishing*, and I will keep no ones name out for less than *two hundred*. *Worcester* would not come down a pound, so I mean to make him out a *fond fool* as I have done *Ponsonby*. Men are more hurt at being painted *weak, silly* creatures than gross blackguards. There are many more of them I shall make smart: if I don't know how myself, I have a friend now, who can help me out to make a good thing of it; and we may yet take up our abode in Portman-square, the old lady can't live for ever."

The above extract will shew, that the lady means not to adhere to truth in any thing, but to conjure up tales for the purpose of extorting money, from all with whom she had the slightest acquaintance. *Mr. Simpson* got a draft for the £150 which was *regularly dishonoured*, and he only waits an opportunity to lay her in limbo.

Her marriage turns out to be only a King's Bench one, not binding in law; and this makes her keep out of the way, for she well knows a dozen writs are out against her.

----

As to my identity, and the degree of fable she has thought proper to varnish over her lies, about my dying under certain disgraceful circumstances, let the reader but keep in mind the two or three facts connected with this silly trick of hers. Mark how a plain tale shall put her down.

Mr. Charles Hemley proposed to me to give up all her (Harriette's) letters, and to abstain from exposing her for the consideration of *four hundred pounds*. Now it so happens, I value my good name more than money — and my little annuity keeps me far above want; so I rejected the offer. Had I accepted it, I suppose I should have been sent to *her Editor* for the cash, which would have been going on a fool's errand with a vengeance.

I may here say that I have lived at Hampstead more than seven years, still under the name of *Johnstone*, and had no communicaton with the *gay world* all that time.

The publisher of this can give my address to any one he is convinced are actuated by honourable motives, to ascertain my existence; - for *Harriete* has industriously circulated through her Pall Mall agents, and retailers of her infamy, "That *I died in a workhouse, and she knows both my executors.*" She cannot lie with any safety; her words lead to her own conviction. She ought to know (for two of her family are now in the workhouse at Windsor) that paupers give up all they possess, and all they may look for in prospectus, before they are sheltered by the parish; consequently, those who die in a workhouse have no occasion for *executors*, having nought to leave behind them. No one after this can believe her story of my death, though she bring witnesses to the register of my burial.

My simple explanations have already materially injured the sale of her lying work, the last number not having come up to any of the former in quantity sold, by some thousands; and if my health permitted, and I could write faster, so as to publish a book at once, I would soon drive her infamous biography totally out of the market, and leave her sordid publisher to his old avocation of "Going! going! gone!"

She had the assurance to threaten the Duke of Beaufort. And we naturally inquire, why does she not put her threats in execution? She dare not; for she well knows I can bring her to account that I have letters in my possession from herself and sisters, which would overwhelm her with more infamy (if possible) than now attaches to her name.

I have reason to know, that my little work has curbed her lying propensity, and *will* prevent her in future from meddling with a number of characters, whom she had marked down in her catalogue as *prey*.

The first number of her Memoirs, and probably the second, were written by her at a time. when she was ignorant that such a one as myself lived to refute her lies. *But* I had taken care she should not know whether I was dead or alive; and, no doubt, she actually wished I had long ago vanished from the earth's surface. One of the principal things insisted upon by my family, was that I should give up all the acquaintances made in my degraded state, before they would extend protection to me or my children; so, of course, she was the first whose society I abandoned. In truth, those who knew me, and the reasons I had for total seclusion from the world, took some pains to convince her I had died in Scotland.

However, she has found to her sorrow, that I am still in the land of the living, and likely to outlive all her calumnies - rescue the innocent from her daring accusations, and make all her baseness recoil upon her own head.

----

Amongst the numberless attempts made by Harriette at raising the wind, was one to insure her life; but owing to a complaint in her side, she was rejected by the insurers, as a bad *subject*. Another time she tried to borrow money from Mrs. Coutts, whose liberality is so very extensive. This application was made through a person named *Jackson*, who holds a pension from Government, on account of certain services in the Accountant General's office.

The security offered, was upon some estates near Kingston-upon-Thames-and the business had nearly been effected. The property, two fields and a house in ruins, did really belong to *Jackson*; and a large farm adjoining, being rented by his brother, they contrived to make it appear that the farm also was Jackson's; and a mere accident put the banking-house in possession of the real facts - and Mrs. Coutts saved her twelve hundred pounds.

If I remember rightly, Harriette had received from that lady fifty pounds in advance, which never was returned. Her friend Jackson is subject to fits of insanity, produced by excessive drinking; and on this account he escaped prosecution for the share he had in this swindling transaction.

Harriette may recollect waiting on several noblemen with a petition on behalf of an officer's widow, Mrs. Relph and her seven children, for whom she received subscriptions to a great amount. She never gave the poor woman more than twenty pounds, though, to my knowledge, she got upwards of two hundred. His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent admitted her to an audience, and gave her a check on his banker for *thirty pounds* - adding to it afterwards ten more, through a letter she wrote, containing pleas of additional distress in the widow's family.

I imagined Harriette had given best part of the money to that poor woman. She now lives on the *heath*; and this morning told me, that a few articles of wearing apparel, and at the utmost, twenty-five pounds, was all she ever received from her hands. She, who could thus rob the widowed and fatherless, (at a time she was herself in affluence) must have a heart more inhuman than a demon from the lower regions.

The late Lord Coleraine was a man of singular character; - sometimes pretending to be religiously inclined - at others, *letting loose* like a venerable debauchee. *Harriette* got introduced to him by my brother; and, though he had little cash to spare, he never declined supplying her exigencies, when it was in his power. She had occasion to hide from her creditors, and his lordship provided her with a lodging on the confines of Finchley Common - (I had this story from her own sister). She dressed in homely garb, and seldom walked out. Lord Coleraine did not always sleep in the lodging, but visited her once a day without fail. He was in his dotage, and fancied she was in love with him. He would probably have made her Lady Coleraine, but for the circumstance of another lady of Harriette's stamp having acquired a prior claim to the title.

There was, about this period, in the neighbourhood of Finchley, a Lieutenant Darke, on leave of absence from a regiment of dragoons -- and with him Harriette commenced an intrigue: she could not exist without being engaged in some such affair.

He shared her bed and board during the absence of my lord; and one day they were engaged in amorous dalliance above stairs, when the old lord came behind them suddenly.

Harriette made her lover get behind the chimney-board; and, seated on the grate, he endured a purgatory indescribable. The table was spread, and cold ham and chicken (Lord Coleraine always dined off these dishes) ordered: wine was to him, the elixer of life-and he swallowed bumper after bumper, until he became intoxicated. Whilst the refection was going on in high glee, Mr. Darke had occasion to cough, the atmosphere being so foul as nearly to cause suffocation. Instantly, his lordship in a fury, rose and attempted to reach the chimney, exclaiming, "By G-d there are thieves in the
fire-place!"

Hereupon *Mr. Darke* burst from his hidingplace - overturned the peer and the table, and his *chere amie*, and rushed down stairs with the rapidity of a deer.

This adventure caused a separation betwixt *Harriette* and her *protector*; and by way of climax, when she moved from her lodgings, she took with her his writing-desk, containing a *gold watch* and seals, worth 150 guineas, and a filled check for £60. The watch was a present from the Prince of Wales; and his lordship only got it back on paying the above-named sum; — so much for Harriette Wilson's honour and honesty.

----

With respect to Harriette's assertions, affecting the Marquis of Worcester and others of the Beaufort family, I fear much is not in my power to be said by way of exculpation; indeed, as my sole object is truth, and to do justice even to an infamous creature - a disgrace to her sex, I shall adhere to facts, nor go out of my way to oblige any one.

There are many persons mentioned in the Memoirs with whom I am unacquainted; or, circumstances related of them, which *might* have happened unknown to me, which I here give her the full benefit of. I am not writing to obtain either favour, friendship, or protection; - in circumstances I am so comfortably situated, as to be indifferent to every thing of a pecuniary nature, -- and as my time of life, with rapidly decaying health, requires silence and retirement, I can have no wish to thrust myself forward again on the busy stage, like a decayed actress, when all her physical and mental powers are destroyed — to be laughed at by fools, and pitied and despised by the wise.

An old bird, which has lost its feathers, or a young one that never had any - if they attempt to fly, are sure to fall.

I was, however, on terms of the closest intimacy with Harriette when she became connected with the Marquis of Worcester; and he will not be very well pleased at my saying, he made himself very silly about her. She was never, what may be termed, regularly under his protection - and never received any stated allowance from him. When he had money, and took fits of generosity, (he always acted by fits and starts) she came in for a plentiful share; but his father, who detested Harriette's very name, kept him very short, well knowing the focus in which his bounty would centre.

The marquis lodged her in Bury Street, at a "Mrs. Mertson Cordaines," who kept apartments of accommodation. This lady is now in a convent near Langres, in France - which convent she gave all her property to; and is there repenting of her sins, and hopes to die with the Pope's blessing.

She was the friend of "Oldfield," the gambler, who was hanged before Newgate some years ago, for the atrocious violation of an infant at Brompton. She had been very useful in her vocation to many of the Greeks. The Duke of Queensbury allowed her ten guineas per month, whilst he lived; but left her unprovided for in his will - of which neglect she loudly complained.

Contrary to most of those who pursue a trade, whose staple commodity is youth and innocence sold to debauchery, she amassed a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; when, seized by compunctions of conscience, she left the brothel for the convent - to end a youth of infamy and pleasure by an old age of superstition and mortification.

At Mrs. Cordaines' Harriette saw a great deal of company - she would have her evening parties, contrary to the marquis's desire: he was very young, and worse than *very foolish* - for she played tricks daily, which would have effectually disgusted a man of more experience: he knew little of the world, and less of love - if a boyish desire for a wanton does not dishonour the name of love. I will relate one particular instance - it then made some noise; 'tis a pity it should be forgotten, for the credit of both parties. Harriette had for some time affected to be unwell, and got permission to remain with me for four days; and I promised the marquis to do all in my power to restore her. The disorder she complained of was more mental than bodily. She came to my house on a Sunday, and left it on Monday morning, declaring, "Though she sacrificed her health , she would return to the marquis, who would be miserable if he slept another night without her."

I was surprised at this resolution, particularly from knowing that the marquis had gone to Windsor; but I concluded she had "that within which passeth shew."

On Tuesday Brummell gave me a call, and said he had seen my friend Harriette at Woolwich, walking with an officer of the artillery; but, added he, "she made herself incog - dropt her veil, and to the right about wheel with her beau, gave me the cut direct." He asked if she had left the marquis? and I put him in possession of the real state of the case, as far as I knew. He left me, and proceeded to Windsor, big with news for the marquis, who returned poste haste to town with his informer; they provided themselves with pistols at Egg's - prime hair triggers of a tremendous size - I have seen them.

Worcester found that his *amiable* landlady, Mrs. Cordaine, knew nothing of the flown bird; he came to me, who tried in vain to dissuade him from going to Woolwich, alledging, that she was in reality, her *own mistress*, and not his, but he was furious, swore "I was engaged in a plot against him, and all women were d----d b------s".

On Wednesday afternoon, I was surprised, by receiving a note from Harriette, requesting my company to tea and supper in Bury-street. To be sure I went, Fanny and a stranger were there, to the latter I was introduced as the brother of *Harriette*, who, for particular reasons, had taken the name of Harman, and was an Officer of Marines. I had never heard of this brother, to whom the marquis was uncommonly civil, almost to. kindness. Harriette "dear brother'd" him at every sentence, and played off, what appeared to me, a second edition of the scene in Gil Blas, betwixt Donna Lucinda, the Marquis of Marialva, and her lover.

In time I became possessed of the true key to this imposture. Harriette had persuaded the marquis, it really was a long lost brother she had met by accident in the street, and accompanied to Woolwich, some one had apprised her of Brummell's embassy to Windsor, and they prepared for manoeuvering at Woolwich accordingly.

Even the officers of the division bore testimony to Lieut. Harman often speaking of his "dear sister, Harriette Wilson," and two of their *wives* were found by the marquis in her company: every one knows what officers will say for one another, to promote an affair of gallantry, and "*marine officers wives*” are proverbial for virtue, as "Bond-street Birds."

To me, in private, Harriette acknowledged her guilt - I said little, for then I was not in circumstances, that would have authorised me to speak my mind, in fact, I could not afford to run the risk of her displeasure. I was sometimes in her power; had I always acted prudently I need not now have come to confession.

Harriette succeeded in carying on this intrigue, and blinding the marquis, during a whole summer.

One evening, the marquis got most gloriously drunk, and with his friend *Hill Darley* sallied out from the Salopian to have a spree; he was then *on duty*, (don't smile) and could not attend to his *duty* in Bury-street, so *Harriette* for one week, imagined she had a fine field to sport in.

There is a house, near the Marsh Gate, over Westminster Bridge, nick-named by swells, the Archbishop's Nunnery," where women of the town resort; and into that, the two jolly topers, reeled, just as the watchman bawled, " past one o'clock;" ordering supper and wine at the refectory, they ran up stairs, and mistaking a bed room for an eating-room, tried the lock; it resisted, and the heroes propelled the door by main force, back upon its hinges, and rushed in. Wax-tapers stood upon the table, empty decanters, and all the fragments of a delicious supper. The bed curtains were undrawn; on the sofa were an officers' uniform, ladies' pelisse, &c. From drunken curiosity, both took a taper, and explored the bed. The Marquis beheld, what sobered him in an instant. He started back with horror, and seized Darley by the arm; just at this moment, the waiter entered , exclaiming, "Oh, dear, gentlemen, this is not the room, you are in the wrong box."

"No! by G- d" said the marquis, "I am in the right box, and if that be not my mistress in bed with her brother, there are no devils in hell, or saints in heaven." With this he dragged off the bed clothes, and began to apply his hands roughly to the parties in "sweet slumber," when more servants of the establishment arriving, forced them out of the room. Harriette and "Joe the Marine," were so stupified by mulled port, they never awoke through the whole noise and tumult. To the bagnio-master, old "Timothy Mills," the marquis made himself known, and it was resolved by the two heroes, to drink till the morning, and surprise the guilty pair at breakfast. When the time arrived "that cocks do crow, and the fifth hour of drowsy morn was named," patience became quite exhausted. A small dog-whip was found, and once more the "sanctum sanctorum," of prostitution entered. Little ceremony was used by the now half sober knights errant. Harriette looked up, and screaming, hid her head beneath the clothes, at sight of the marquis, who by the leg, dragged out on the floor, Harriette's sham brother.

In vain he strove to resist, Mr. Hill Darley, got his head betwixt his knees, and held him there nearly choked, whilst the Marquis belaboured him, *au posteriori*, most unmercifully, till his skin was as red as his regimental jacket.

This task completed, the assailants retired, and a note was left for Harriette , desiring her "to find some other dupe," and return to Bury street no more.

Hill Darley, who never could be silent, except at the gaming table, spread the story, under injunctions of secrecy, all over the west-end of the town. The marquis became the sport of all the ton, and adopted a strange plan to shelter himself from ridicule.

He denied the whole affair, declared it to be a fabrication, and made poor Hill Darley his tool, admit himself a liar. To prove that Darley was really a liar, Harriette remained at her usual lodgings, gave her usual parties, and walked arm in arm with the Marquis, up and down St. James's street, for several days together. The marine was sent on foreign service, for Worcester had some influence at the admiralty, and the "two turtle doves," as they were called, billed and cooed together, as though nothing had occurred. I have known instances of greater infatuation than this. Young men at a certain period of life, under the impressions of a first passion, are certainly not in their real senses; and Worcester's now were, what is termed, "sent a wool gathering."

This event bore convincing testimony, that the noble marquis was at all events a good natured, forgiving fellow, and merited a mistress of more constancy. I was daily annoyed to answer his long epistles, which were written sensibly enough for the son of a duke, not quite so Chesterfieldian as Haynes', nor so vulgar as Foote's. It was the fashion for young men to procure letters from any celebrated demirep, and shew them amongst friends, boasting of their success. When a lover had a vanity of this kind, Harriette suited her letters accordingly; if he paid well, she wrote well of him, and per contra. I know, also, that she, Harriette, and her sisters, wrote letters for each other, as if from certain noble admirers, which formed subjects of ridicule or triumph, at a scandal coterie, according as it suited their purpose to use them.

Mrs. Caroline Higgins was very useful in this way; and Harriette had seals made with the impressions of coats of arms of the first families, which were used for infamous purposes. Poor Fanny, wrote a pretty hand of her own, but Amy could disguise her's effectually, and imitate others so well, she has often deceived me. This lady exhibited a carte-blanche, drawn up, she avowed, by a Secretary of Legation, then at one of the continental courts, and a warm love-letter accompanying it - the letter fastened with the seal of the British embassy. According to her account, she refused this triumph; and a copy of her reply to the doating honourable, was sure to be brought forth when a lover was by, for the sake of whom she pretended to have made the sacrifice. I decline mentioning the secretary's name, for he is now married, and false as the whole was, it might create uneasiness; and my wish is to dispel suspicion, and not engender it.

Amy was a perfect jilt, and a modern Messalina; she received and dismissed lovers daily, nay, hourly, if that be all. She had neither delicacy or feeling-her sole motive for action, for debasing herself, was to amass money: in dress she was very extravagant; in her household affairs mean and pitiful; and her door was continually beset by trades-people, dunning her for small sums, when she had probably a thousand guineas spread on her toilet during the morning visits of her admirers - to let them see she was not comeatable but by prompt and large payments.

I do not credit Harriette's asserting that the Marquis offered her marriage-he certainly never made her proposals in writing. She once pressed him hard for a settlement, and he fought shy in giving a decisive answer - in truth he had not any thing to settle; and in reply to a letter sent on that subject, Harriette having left his lodgings, vowing not to return until he had secured her from the consequences of his future inconstancy, he wrote thus from Whitehall: "Indeed - indeed - you know I have not any thing to settle upon you: but myself, in a very little time, if I manage to keep well with my father and other relatives, I expect to fill a high and a lucrative situation somewhere near Whitehall; and I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll enter into a bond to allow you one half of the income, to do as you please with, and "No questions asked." And I will bind myself to make you a settlement equal to it, when I become *******, which I hope will be many years hence.

> "You should not now pester me, when I am assailed on all sides on your account. My uncle only this morning read me such a lecture - and they all insist on my marrying immediately. I scarce know how to put off the evil day; and I can't persuade myself to be so cruelly unjust, as to give my hand, whilst my heart is in another's keeping. Meet me in Pall Mall, near Metelane's, about four o'clock. I know your absence is all a humbug - I have been fortunate this morning, and you shall shop as much as you like. I should be absolutely cashless, but from using a little hypocrisy - I learnt it from you; so forget and forgive. The boy has also a letter for Julia, who will attend you; and I wish you would give directions about the wine and cordials. The quantity is paid for, so make your selection as to the different sorts.
>
> Your's entirely,
> W.

From the tenor of this letter, it may be perceived, that Harriette had gained great ascendancy over the mind of this young man; but not so much as she pretends. He talks very plainly of his intended marriage; and when she declares that negotiations were carried on lately, to induce her to give up sundry letters, it may be very true, setting aside the idea that any of these letters contained promises of marriage, they would have sufficient nonsense in them to make the Beaufort family desirous of burying them all in oblivion.

The Marquis of Sligo, whom she used to call "Newgate Sligo," from the circumstance of his enduring six month's imprisonment for stealing sailors from a ship of war, was a sort of cavalier admirer of Harriette ; he wooed her a la distance, and appeared to me always to believe, he had only to signify a wish and be accepted; but he did not demean himself so far as to give her a chance of refusing him. He certainly wrote to her more than once, requesting an interview — not a selfish one, mark me, on his own part, but as an explanatory courier extraordinary on behalf of His Grace of Leinster; no one ever wrote to Harriette, if he was of any consequence, but she made it out to be a love affair at bottom - not that she always believed it, but she wished others so to believe.

She had a weak side - that was vanity: and often thought men were really dying for her, who were living quite indifferent whether she were dead or alive.

----

Poor Smith, the linen-draper, has suffered so many severe losses by his good - nature in giving her credit, and whom she now dares not face. -- She did absolutely think Smith [admired her, because he was so easily managed in a settlement of accounts. She did play off upon all her tradesmen in general the artillery of her eyes, and many of them were put *hors de combat* by this mode of amorous warfare . Smith, I aver, was not of the number ; he was always led away by hopes of payment, knowing the many noble and liberal patrons she had at her beck and call, and whenever he insisted strongly, for payment of a bill, she brought him to with,

"Well, Sir, call to morrow, and I'll pay it, and thenceforth we are done with each other, and I'll take care none of my friends shall ever lay out a penny more in Mr. Smith's shop."

Smith overrated her influence amongst her high friends, and many of them were his best customers; so that fear and not love often sent him away empty-handed. There are many who read this, will recollect her riding like a mad woman through the Parks, on a stout cream-coloured charger, with her hair streaming loose in the wind, and her beaver half off, with a servant on a cart horse, in brown livery, toiling after her she was then upon the wane, like a shop that has ceased to attract customers, making a fine outside show, the goods marked, "selling off under prime cost."

A charger was lent to her by Old Lord Coleraine, and she made the loan a gift; he was sold at Tattersall's. Her servant's name was Tom Smith. That an occasional waiter at Long's and the Albemarle, whom she hired at so much per diem, and mounted him at Newman's livery stables in Swallow-street. "Tom Smith" had been a helper to Lord Byron, and for some service he rendered that eccentric noble, got raised to be a supernumerary valet. Tom had some striking qualities appertaining to him: whatever he took up he generally deposited in his pocket, if it was of a portable nature; and making free with a few trinkets of Lord Byron, he was discharged without a character; he got one, however, apparently signed by the noble peer, and, I believe, written and executed by his mistress pro tempore, Harriette Wilson.

She commonly put ber menials to more uses than one; and had reasons for keeping on good terms with them. Tom acted the part of a flying postman, when she was at the Regent's Park with Coleraine; and he carried on several of her intrigues, till she disposed of him by recommendation to a Baronet going to the East Indies. The fellow is now returned , and may be seen lurking about the Dowager Marchioness of Lansdowne's whenever she gives a rout during the dog days. From this fellow she learnt several particulars of Lord Byron, and even procured some of his writings which the fellow had stolen; by using these means, she manufactured about a dozen letters as if written to her pretty self, from that unfortunate poet; whether she has destroyed those forgeries, or does not dare to use them on my account, is a question I may have to discuss hereafter. I merely write these particulars, to prepare the public, in case she brings forth a Byronic gazette extraordinary. 

There was a merchant once (all the world knows) in high repute, at the east end of the town, "Mr. Campbell Graham." Harriette called him her "wise man of the east," who brought her offerings of jewels and silks in abundance. This gentleman commenced an acquaintance with her at Margate, and leaving his amiable wife and three lovely infants, took a trip to France with Harriette. I do not know any other trip ever made by her to that land of frivolity, and suspect it was on this journey, she made out Mrs. Nesbitt to her companion and butt. Mr. and Mrs. Hartland (for by these appellations they travelled) lived in gay style at Paris: he gamed deeply — she intrigued widely - and once so far succeeded as to be invited to a large mixed party of nobles at the celebrated Marshal Soult's Hotel.

There she was noticed by the British Ambassador, who really believed her to be an Englishmerchant's honest wife. Unluckily, " Tom Adams ," formerly of the light horse, and latterly of "Gordon's hell," recognized my lady throughout her Parisian disguises, and a whisper circulated which set all eyes upon her. Poor Graham, who had not much spirit, became alarmed at the consequences which might ensue through his introducing his mistress amongst so many honourable ladies, and he stole her away privately. Whether the ambassador felt hurt at the deception practised on Marshal Soult, I know not, but on the following day a *gens d'arme* called
upon Mr. Graham, and presented a passport, with a gentle intimation, that he would see him and Madame on the road to the frontier quickly.

Fear gave wings to the merchant, and they were soon posting towards Calais as if the devil drove them: the gentle Harriette was quite horrified at the idea of a Frenchman. At Calais they got rid of their guard, and might have made something like an honourable retreat but for the imprudence of Harriette. She had, when at Paris, unknown to her paramour, run up a bill for jewellery to the amount of four thousand francs, and she either did not, or would not, recollect to pay for them on her departure.

I will not take upon me to say that she absolutely intended to defraud the jeweller, but it is so very like her swindling tricks, that if I were compelled to give a decisive opinion, it would be against her. She well knew how low Mr. Graham's finances were then sinking, and she had no cash of her own to appropriate to the payment of so heavy a sum. Just as they were on the point of stepping on board the steamer, an officer of the police, who had been sent express from Paris, arrested them both, and conveyed them before the proper authorities. All the boasted fortitude of Harriette now forsook her, she saw herself taken up as a felon; and as there are no private hearings at Calais or private sittingrooms, she was mingled at the bar with a multitude of the most low and depraved of the sexes.

Graham already fancied himself in the gallies, tugging at the oar, and bitterly reproached himself for his folly in consorting with so thoughtless a little wretch. When the case was stated, the French magistrate, without hearing a word they had to say, committed them both to prison, and directed all their luggage to be seized and brought to the office. Harriette for once in her life did not sham fits, she had them in reality, and her situation excited the commiseration of an English gentleman, who had attended at the office throughout the whole affair.

Harriette was removed into the open air, and a long conversation ensued betwixt him and the magistrate, which ended in his bail being accepted for their appearance next morning. As he came to hand Harriette out to his carriage, she screamed with terror, and called out for mercy, lustily ; when , however, the matter was explained, she flew at her deliverer, as she called him, threw her arms round his neck, and nearly stifled him with kisses. This mode of expressing her gratitude was not at all pleasing to her paramour, nor to him she was beslobbering; the hey-day of his blood was cool, and the little ancient man begged her to desist with tears in his eyes. They were soon in his house, and all terrors were for the present dissipated the kind feelings of this stranger towards Harriette were of a truly sympathetic nature, he had once languished in a prison under all the horrors of a sentence of death, and his life was spared upon condition that he left England never to return.

Probably some of my readers are old enough to recollect the case of Mr. Aslett, the nephew of Abraham Newland, and deputy cashier to the Bank of England, who appropriated some hundreds of thousand pounds to his own use. He was condemned to be executed, but pardoned, on account of Exchequer bills not then being reckoned money. This was the very Mr. Aslett, who held, at Calais, the situation of Inspector of English bank notes and bills. With his former failings I have nothing to do. In this case he acted kindly and generously, and I am told it was not a solitary instance of his good offices being exercised for the benefit of countryfolks; but for him Harriette would have made a sad end of her sentimental journey in France.

Harriette had actually sold a part of the jewels; the remainder were forthcoming, these were given to the officer, and Mr. Aslett cashed Graham's bill, (which was never repaid) for sufficient means to make up the deficiency. With grateful hearts, for I presume she must have felt so for a little time, they bade adieu to Mr. Aslett and to France. The tale had gone before them, and when they landed on Dover pier, they were instantly mobbed. "Aye, there they go, there's the two worthies who robbed Perigaux' Bank at Paris, of four thousand pounds, and were taken up for it at Calais." "Yes, yes," says another, "thanks to her pretty face, or she would have been hanged." Shocked at this, they were hurrying on towards the York Hotel, when who should meet them "full butt," (as Lord Alvanley says) but the legitimate Mrs. Campbell Graham and her three lovely children. A spectre from the tomb, or another visit from a French police officer would have been more welcome to both parties. "Good heavens, Harriette," said Graham, "there's my termagent of a wife, hide me, save me from her fury!" and he tried in vain to conceal himself by pulling his coat collar up above his ears.

Now Mrs. Graham was not one of those milk and water ladies, whose passive tempers can put up with the grossest injuries and sing with resignation, "If you dishonour my truth and deceive me, Can I ever upbraid you, Oh, no! my love, no." She could not see the woman, whose arts had deprived her of her husband's affections, and made her children fatherless, without being worked up to a pitch of frenzy, worse than Kate in Shakespeare's play of "The Taming of the Shrew;" thus no sooner did she espy La belle Harriette hanging upon her husband's arm, than without any ceremony, the enraged wife with one well-directed blow on the organ of smelling, laid La belle sprawling in the mud, and bawling out murder. Before the Custom-house officers could succeed in securing her arms, she had eased Harriette of several ounces of the stream of life, and her head of sundry handfuls of her raven hair, the pride, the boast, and delight of her soul.

By the way, the readers of this Memoir must have remarked she was no match for the belligerent spirit of Mrs. Graham, and was borne into the hotel, and put to bed, where we will leave her for a short time, to be plastered up by the surgeon. The by-standers had afforded her neither pity nor assistance, as Mrs. Graham, when she first discovered them on the deck of the packet, let the female part of the lookers-on into the secret, and Dover people hold any infringment of the marriage vow, as little short of murder. As for poor Graham, he would also have come in for his share of vengeance, had he not, coward-like, abandoned the abandoned Harriette, and ran to the Mayor's as fast as fear and his heels could carry him. Thither his wife was also brought in custody.

Mr. Graham would have nothing to do with his legal amazonian heroine, and by the Mayor's interference, he paid her down a handsome sum of money, and bound himself to allow her and the children in future sufficient to support them; a thing which they never received. Harriette had so completely got the measure of this infatuated man's foot, that in less than twelve months she saw him a ruined man; for, at that period of their connexion he became a bankrupt, and sooner than face his creditors at a final examination, he left England and became an outlaw.

I always do Harriette justice where I consistently can with truth, therefore I declare, that she was not the only cause of this man's ruin; he was addicted to gaming and many low vices besides, to the total neglect of his extensive business. But his case is so well known, that a repetition here would be of no service ; all this does not suit the business on which I wish more particularly to expatiate, but it serves to throw a light upon some of the black shades in this woman's character, than whom I believe a more impudent and shameless harlot never disgraced London streets.

## liberties are taken with the name of Mr. Elliston

I come now to that part of the Memoirs, where liberties are taken with the name of Mr. Elliston, the manager of Drury-Lane Theatre-Royal. No man, probably, ever took more pains to expose his public character and private untoward disposition than this once popular comedian. He is every night his own dear self upon the stage, so that all may judge of the manner of his acting: he is also every day almost, answering for his frivolties upon the Theatre of Bow-Street Police Office, where, (as somebody observed)

> 'Tis painful to relate,
> The sad realities of his curst fate,
> Whose hasty temper and o'erbearing mind
> Brings him the enmity of all mankind,
> And women too, if they should interpose,
> Where he alternate deals out threats or blows,
> And indiscriminately tries to send
> To h-ll alike his enemy or friend;
> Making the moral stage a boxing school,
> Whereon he acts the bully and the fool:
> And nightly drunk with popular applause,
> Pays with his purse for trampling on the laws.

It would be a vain attempt of mine to defend the character of this very arrogant little King of the Drama, but I will never give a good name to one, whose demerits so greatly outweigh his theatrical excellencies; and if I tell truth, which I all along have done, I can speak very little good of Elliston. Harriette's embellishments in composition are either of the terrific or disgusting kind: she never runs into a pleasing extreme, nor tries

> "To correct the follies of mankind ,
> To mend the morals and enlarge the mind;
> With honest mirth to kill an evening's care,
> And light the gloomy features of despair.”

For this kind of recreative sport she has no taste. She is a painter, the Salvator Rosa of low life, capable of delineating only the dark sides of the picture; but shrinking with dismay from the brilliant hues, which render the landscape enchanting, and immortalize the agreeable artist. No ! they make no part of the solicitudes of Harriette or her publisher, both of them arid, and dry as the sands of Bassorah. The squabble at the box door about a drunken coachman, was, I believe, partly true; but I cannot speak very certain, for I was at the time inside of the carriage, though Miss Wilson chuses to forget I was one of the party.

Now the sheer fact is, that Elliston was then neither drunk nor sober, but in the ""happy medium, ripe for fun, and wide awake to all going on around him." He certainly mounted the coach box, as the fellow refused to deliver up the reins, he called two firemen employed about the theatre, and ordered them to remove him. But jarvey became quite obstropolous, was very determined and very strong: so that in removing him they all three came to the ground together in a clatter, the fall was gentle, and only created laughter in those who made the slip.

According to her florid statement, the coachman was hurled from his box (as if little Elliston had been "a Titan grown") with brutal violence. Elliston was ultimately obliged to send the fellow to the watch-house, he raised such a mob round the doors, and he was discharged thence when sober. Whatever Elliston may do in his passionate moments, he is always sorry for it when a calm ensues; and I never heard, that even in his cups, he was addicted to acts of wanton cruelty. As to wanton oppression towards his second-rate performers, he has been so often taxed with it, that I must believe it to be all true.

He made an apology himself at the supper, no doubt; and when he is tipsyfied and amongst great men, he always becomes intolerably offensive, by a wish to appear as great, or greater than they. At such times he is not content with being admitted upon an equality - he must be the "head and front" of the company, or he will not remain satisfied.

Lord Lowther and others, on this and many similar occasions, when I have been in his company, only laughed at the stage- actor's ridiculous airs. Bob Elliston's restlessness always reminded me of the fable of the frog and the ox. His voice is pleasing, though of small compass. He has also "an ear for music," and instead of his forgetting the words of a song, like his predecessor in office, he never speaks so well or has so retentive a memory, on or off the stage, as when he is half-seas over. He very politely often furnished us with admission tickets to his theatre, and I at all events felt obliged for these acts of kindness.

It was upon one of those evenings when we had no engagements at home or abroad, that we took advantage of Elliston's civility in this respect, and in genteel deshabille, Harriette, Amy, and myself went to see the performance of "The Merry Wives of Windsor," and seated ourselves in front of the second circle of boxes.
We were not known to any one, and expected no adventure, but sucked oranges a l'ordinaire, and meditated upon the play and the actors in silence.

At the fall of the curtain, an elderly looking gentleman came into the box, and seated himself behind Harriette. He introduced himself by handing round to us a box of conserves, which were scented with otto of roses. Harriette with her usual impertinence, declined the proffer, observing they stank of Naples soap, but said she could eat some grapes. The old battered beau immediately rose and went out, soon returning with a servant bringing an elegant assortment of grapes and other scarce fruits in a basket.

I was rather struck with this polite acquiesence in a rude request, as he did not appear to be a man of wealth; nor did we look much like ladies, either of pleasure or fashion, for as I hinted before, we were disguised in very homely apparel.

When the servant was going, our new aequaintance told him "to get the carriage as near the door as possible," and was answered by "Yes, Sir Charles."

'Tis surprising the metamorphosis this reply caused on all our countenances .. As for Harriette, she did what she was albeit unused to do, blushed! and for once in her life, looked as if ashamed of herself. *Pour moi, je merougir za ce moment, dans la ressouvenir de celui-la*. The curtain now rising for the entertainment, relieved our embarrassment, and I had time to survey the whole exterior of our titled gallant, and thus brought him to account, in my mind: a very slender form, sickly pale countenance, not at all prepossessing, marked with the furrows of near sixty winters at least; brown frock coat, buff waistcoat, diamond pin, leather inexpressibles, and Jolliffe gaiters. Nothing of the gentleman conspicuous, either in dress or manners, added to which he seemed to have lost the use of his fingers , pulling off his hat with his fists, as one may say, griping it.

He was polite to all, but paid more attention to Harriette than either of us. This vexed R Amy, pleased Harriette, and was matter of perfect indifference to me. I was more pleased with O'Keefe's nonsense on the stage, than all the old man's nonsense in our box. Towards the conclusion, Harriette proffered to "make a move." We did not chuse to go into the saloon in the present deshabille, especially as I had seen several of our titled friends in the house, and I did not much approve of our cicesbeo myself, though I am not proud, and can stoop without difficulty to mingle with any society one degree above vulgarity.

Our new friend, Sir Charles, insisted upon setting us all down at our own door, and this proposal being acceded to, when we imagined ourselves arrived there, behold we were ushered into the Fountain Tavern, the house with two entrances, one in Exeter street, another in Catharine-street, Strand. And, (I presume, reader, you have some knowledge of the gay world, or you would not have followed me thus far in my rigmarole of bon-ton and folly) every one knows this house was at that time, one where ladies and gentlemen retired from the cares of busy life, to enjoy gentle repose, or take delicious refreshments after the play is ended.

Sir Charles had taken the precaution to make his coachman manoeuvre a little; for he had driven us about the streets full half an hour, though, in a straight line, this paphian sanctuary was not one hundred yards from the box door of the theatre. This circumstance subsequently proved to my entire satisfaction, that the master as well as the man were in the habit of bringing hither unsuspecting young persons to complete the seduction which his arts had begun, for no distinct order could have been given to drive to the Fountain after he brought us the grapes.

My two companions did not hesitate to alight and enter. I made a little demur at first; but when I reflected no harm could possibly come from our antiquated swain, as there were three of us; and, in point of good name, alas! we had none to lose. The little of which I once boasted, and wished to preserve, had nearly left me, owing to the encreasing notoriety of my hopeful acquaintance, neither of whom ever possessed any character whatever. Yet, a sort of fatality kept me in their society, though I neither honoured nor esteemed them. But then, the doors of every respectable female were closed against Julia Johnstone, and I dared not trust myself out of all company! my thoughts when alone, almost overpowering my reason - alas, the day! In an elegantly furnished drawing - room of this seductive Fountain, where the walls are hung with lascivious paintings from Ovid, Tibullus, and Tommy Moore, those poet-laureats of his majesty the devil, and where Ottomans' doublechairs and reposing stools, were placed around in gilded variety. We were quickly served with a supper, consisting of every delicacy, in and out of season.

Here Harriette, seated opposite a large mirror, played off all her airs and graces, and did ample justice, according to her usual way, to the burgundy and champaign. Strong liquors were then her aversion; but of rich wines Miss Harriette could carry off an equal quantity with either Lord Yarmouth or John Wilson Croker. Apropos de vins, I understand since these are out of her power to come at, she regales herself with spirits, made into what Sir Joseph Nourse used to call "grog," viz. rum, water, and sugar candy. In all respects was our Sir Charles a man of information; he amused us at supper time with relations of his various feats of gallantry, and concluded by candidly admitting that he was fast approaching the list of "has beens;" but said he, "I will talk of it always, for I got returned to parliament twice by making love to the electors' wives and daughters. and my sisters kissed the voters into good humour." The praises of women shall have my last breath, They cheered me through life, and will soothe me in death ."

He would fain have persuaded us all to have slept at the Fountain, how he did not say, but this request I positively refused to comply with, as a thing at total variance with my taste, and wholly destructive of the unities we expect to find in one's sleeping partner. Is was not, however, a new thought, nor has the practice passed entirely away. I have heard of late that Mrs. Cox's theatrical lover, used often to go to roost with three companions at a time; but I can't comprehend the object of such disgusting practices, that debase either sex below the brute creation. I believe I am far from raising up the imagination of my readers to the contemplation
of the marvellous , but after a lapse of twenty
years , I cannot help noticing a coincidence of
names since writing the preceding sentence. Sir
Charles more than once or twice apostrophised
one of his mistresses under that name , calling
her his dear little Mary Cox. "
«
Worse,
" Is she then dead ? " I enquired .
worse than that ; she is married ."--" Oh, that
ought to be no obstacle," I ventured to observe.
" Not exactly," replied Sir Charles , “ but I
have given my word no more to covet or desire,
and all that sort of thing. But in fact I have no
desire. Apropos, have you ever read the
Arabella story, about given at Paris, by a
Baronet ? That's me ; but I'll tell you it another
time. We shall meet again ; yes, yes, we will
meet."
As to the proposal about staying, Harriette
said she would not remain all night ; but at the
same time was in no hurry to quit her new ac199
quaintance, to whom she had given her name .
He expressed great joy at his good fortune in
meeting with one so justly celebrated , and swore
he wished for her acquaintance long before ."
" Not," said he, "from any improper motives ,
for I am past all that, and my constitution won't
afford my being in love above once a week ;
whereas formerly it returned upon me once an
hour. I have separated from my lady many
years, purely because she was in love with me,
and I was in love with many ."
Amy and I became at length heartily sick of
such fiddle -faddle nonsense ; and as we rose to
go, he ordered the carriage , promising to escort
Harriette home in less than hour. She made no
scruple to stay, though alone ; but from mere
affectation rung for the maid, and caused her to
sit down in a corner, and not quit the room
whilst Sir Charles and her were together.
This blind neither served her purposes with
me or her sister , who were up to all her mancuvres
; and Sir Charles , by his own account, was
an adept in intrigue, and not to be deceived,
though a syren lured him to her wiles.
On our ride home, I lamented Harriette's im200
prudence ; but Amy remarked, that it was no
matter so long as nobody knew it." Notwithstanding
which, she was the first to go and spread
it all over the town.
That night we saw no more of Harriette, and
it was near dinner time next day, when the same
carriage set her down at our door, and she tript
into the parlour with unusual animation, drest
in an elegant riding-habit and hat, with a new
brilliant watch and neck- chain, in full display.
Her story was, that she remained up all the
morning at the Fountain, and played at backgammon
with Sir Charles till she won so much
that a compromise was made for the attire and
jewellery we now saw. I neither believed or
cared for the truth of her story ; and as she
pulled out a bank note of large amount to pay
me a long account for rent and so forth, I confess
my feelings of disgust underwent considerable
diminution , so much does self-interest
sway us all , that we look upon things abhorrent
to our nature as quite bearable, if they turn to
our present happiness or future benefit.
It is time that I make known to my reader,
olev
calling to a very ba

### Page 201

that the hero who is at the fountain head of this
little gallant story, was Sir Charles Bamfylde,
who has been shot since then, by the frantic
husband of his housekeeper . After the foregoing
adventure, Sir Charles continued an occasional
intimacy with Harriette for about a year,
and seldom suffered her to be in want of money .
Unluckily for her, he was going up Constitution
Hill one evening, and there he beheld his chaste
Harriette walking betwixt a sergeant and corporal
of the Life Guards ; he made certain it was
her, and then hurried to my house, and made me
acquainted with the discovery. His eyes , he said,
were unerring guides, and could not deceive him .
He would never encourage her any more.—
" Zounds," said the Baronet, rearing up his
spiral form , " if the jade has no virtue , she ought
to have decent pride about her ; and so all this
time I have been keeping two huge life guardsmen,
and not a mistress ."
She attempted to deny that it was her he had
seen, by means of long letters and lying assertions
; and endeavoured to renew the intimacy,
but without success .

### Page 202

Though Sir Charles left off calling at my house
he did not cut my society quite dead, and whenever
we met in public, was very polite and attentive
. He has come into our box, but never
once opened his lips to the once charming
Harriette.
She was not easily disconcerted , and often
ridiculed him aloud in offensively coarse terms.
One evening she carried matters so far, that
Lord Alvanley asked her, if she thought herself
at the bar of a gin-shop, abusing a poor customer.
More than once I have been told , that she
means, if she publishes any more , (for the public
have left off purchasing her lies ) to accuse me of
an improper intimacy with this baronet, and
having been the cause of his quitting her,
therefore, I have given the particulars of this intrigue
to the best of my recollection , so that if
she has the hardihood to trump up any such
idle tale, my readers will know what credit is
due to it.
I have already deterred her from bringing out
several gentlemen, for fear of bringing herself
into a scrape. But it is not her own lovers

### Page 203

alone she delights to expose, but the peace and
happiness ofvarious females. She would destroy
ladies of rank and title in particular , who never
did her any harm, or scarce ever heard of her
name.
Amongst the sufferers of this class , whom I
think I can clear from her aspersions is, Lady
Caroline Lamb. By the bye , I wonder much
that her husband does not prosecute Stockdale,
for so foul a libel on his wife's honour and fame ,
as appears in Harriette's Memoirs.
Lady Caroline is well known as the spouse of
Mr. William Lamb, and once canvassed Westminster
for his brother George. She is a lady
of respectable talents, rather too much inclined
to the blue-stocking class, or “ Bas bleu assemblee,"
and I am told once belonged to that club of
authors, at the head of which, was the late
Margravine of Anspach, at the Brandenburgh
House.
Apropos , little Tommy Moore was secretary
and sonneteer to those worthies.
Lady Caroline Lamb was, in her very early
years, long before reason waited upon the judgment,
attached to Lord Byron, from a coincidence

### Page 204

of genius . She had already written some very
pretty verses and passable novels ; and the
poetical Peer encouraged her by his approbation
to go on. Nothing beyond flirtations ever came
out of this affair, as they were only in love upon
paper and in rhyme ..
3
The world have been recently led astray by a
passage in " Medwin's Conversations ," where
his lordship is made to speak of a lady of title,
who broke into his house and apartment disguised
as a chairman , abused him, and frightened his
valet Fletcher out of his senses, if ever he had
any .
That Lady Caroline could deceive any one in
the garb of a herculean traveller between the
poles, is a thing utterly impossible, when her
diminutive , delicate , and slender form is considered
. She might make a pretty little boy in
smallclothes, were such a course desireable, but
no one could take her for a man.
If ever any lady intruded herself upon Lord
Byron, as Medwin would have us believe, it
must have been some masculine heroine , name
205
unknown. A Harriette Wilson, for instance ,
might have done so, she has done such things .
Yet, let me not waste time and paper unprofitably.
None believe a word of Medwin's
writing ; not even Colbourn, who is in himself the
finest gudgeon going, so I have done with the
Captain Candid of Byron's conversational moments
.
Harriette has a peculiar antipathy to Lord
Melbourne's family, for no other reason than his
having spurned her from him, when he saw ruin
impending if he fostered any longer the vile
serpent in his bosom.
But her object is to make up books filled with
lies , as if she and her publisher had sworn never
to speak a word of truth in print. By reason
of those exposeés and detections, I understand
that Harriette Wilson and her publisher
find themselves annoyed , and wince at every
word of truth, which I confess to shame her , and
give him the lie . I wonder whether the fellow
will fight ?
It is worthy of observation , that she never
mentioned the name of Lady Caroline Lamb,
until an account appeared in the " Times ," of a
S
1

### Page 206

Lady (supposed to be this Lady Caroline) being
driven up to Melbourne House , in a carriage and
four in a state bordering upon distraction. Harriette
seized upon this accidental circumstance ,
and began a tirade , in her Memoirs , against the
lady, and now wishes to make the world believe ,
she has driven that lady to frenzy through her
calumnies , for she has libelled the Stanhopes
as severely as the Lambs.
Oh , what a horrid soul a woman must be cursed
with, to exult at having ruined the peace of
mind of another, who is famous for every domestic
virtue , and deals in charity to all the
human race !
Miss Wilson says she hired a girl , who had been
dismissed from Lady Caroline's service . That she
should hire a discarded servant in preference ,
would be very probable, in order to elicit all the
scandal from her she could , and send it forth
again to mortify those superior to her in virtue.
I very well remember her hiring this woman ,
who had once been assistant kitchen maid at
Brocket Hall , but never was in Melbourne House
in her life ; and who from her situation could

### Page 207

have no possible intercourse with Lady Caroline
Lamb.
This wretched poor woman had been on the
town for a year or two, and undergone the discipline
of the Magdalen charity, and got foisted by
some of the members upon the public as a reformed
women ; they get into service by
recommendations from the subscribers, by a
species of false characters . This woman had
been dismissed from Brocket Hall, for stealing a
cream ewer ; and she met Harriette at Knight's
Tavern in Jermyn- street, where she often called
in disguise with some of her paramours .
The wench was certainly very ragged when she
entered Harriette's service ; but when clothed
decently, was really a good looking, good for
nothing creature .
She deceived me at first by her affectation of
candour and humility. Her common expression
was " Lard , ma'am , I wouldn't tell a lie if I was
to go to heaven for it ;" and " I wouldn't falsify
myself for the finest lord in the land for to be my
husband."
Her simple vulgarity deceived me into think208
ing her an artless fool , incapable of deceit. Now
it so happens that this slut came to live with
Harriette in 1804 , before Mr. William Lamb was
married, and could not know any thing about
Lady Caroline , who possibly might have occasionally
visited , but not resided in the family.
if
Miss Wilson does well not to give dates, but
any one chuses to take the trouble of adverting
to stories, they will find things that occurred
some twenty years ago , detailed as though they
had happened two years since , and the transactions
of yesterday thrown back a dozen years .
In one instance, she speaks of the Duke of Wellington
when he was but Sir Arthur Wellesly, as
she docs of Argyle when he was but Lorne ; and
twenty other such self-condemning lies may be
detected in every one of her parts .
The future fortunes of this servant girl are not
mentioned by her mistress, so I must supply the
deficiency she got into the Byron family for a
time, and was turned off for intriguing with the
footman, and admitting a watchman into the
house at midnight. Harriette again received her,
for these kind of imputations would be quite to

### Page 209

Miss Wilson's taste , and in my opinion got her
into that service orginally on purpose to sow discord
in the family , and act as her spy upon Lord
Byron, against whose heart she carried on a useless
crusade for a long time. Truly there was
no wile she did not practise, no wickedness of
which that woman was not capable. She was , to
use the words of that excellent man , Mr. Canning,
when he was traduced by an anonymous scribbler ,
" A liar and a hypocrite , and only wanted
courage to be an assassin." She had , indeed,
been the assassin of many a one's reputation ,
and driven happiness from many a peaceful
dwelling.
Through what means I do not pretend to know,
but she may have the impudence to say through
mine, as I was upon good terms with Sir Henry
Mildmay, she procured her the situation of confidential
servant to the once Countess of Roseberry,
now the unhappy " Lady Mildmay."
I knew perfectly well she had got into such a
place, but hoping she might turn out a better
woman and reform her ways, I said not any thing
for or against her , and from mistaken humanity ,

### Page 210

" let the poison do its work." She aftewards
went abroad with the family , and at Rome , by Sir
Henry's own orders , was discharged for excessive
impertinence. The late Duchess of Devonshire
entertained her as a chamber maid, and at her
death , left her in common with all her servants,
a small legacy . I next can trace this unfaithful
servant to Paris, where she got in the service of
the celebrated Madame de Stael ; but here she
could not keep her hands from " picking and
stealing," no more than she can keep her tongue
like her mistresses, from " lying and slandering."
Madame de Stael charged her with pilfering
a gold watch and two thousand francs . Under
this charge she remained in the hands of the
police for several days. The watch was recovered,
and a small part of the money.
The philanthrophy of " Neckar's daughter,"
as they call de Stael, is known to all Europe ;
and as she declined prosecuting the delinquent ,
she was conducted across the northern frontier
by a file of gens d'armes, and subsequently hired
herself in a bagnio at Brussels . When in that
unenviable situation, she, was recognized by her

### Page 211

old mistress and companion in guilt, Harriette
Wilson Rochfort, and she again became a partaker
of her fortunes, and is now the only
creature in the shape of a servant that lady has
got ; unless, as I apprehend the profits of her
Memoirs have enabled her to launch out a little,
to which she is ever inclined .
Reader, these are sacred truths, and if the
good name of Lady Caroline Lamb, or any
other dignified person, can possibly be injured
by any thing coming from such a pair of
fiends , then
" Calumny must lord it o'er the earth ,
And there be anarchy in heaven . "
The case of Lady Caroline Lamb has excited
more attention in the beau-monde than it ought
to have done, when the character of her accuser
is considered ; but I hope I have now set at rest
the minds of any one who might be sceptical on
the subject. Her ladyship all her life exhibited a
flighty disposition, and acted upon many occa212
sions with great giddiness . For instance , her
personal canvass of the Westminster electors in
behalf of her husband's brother ; but this is an
act for which he ought to be blamed as much as the
lady ; for, if it had not been acceptable to him,
certainly it would not have been done. But in
pursuit of ambition , men frequently forget the
respect due to women and to themselves also ;
like what we read of Augustus , who excused all
the murders he sanctioned , alleging they were
trifles in comparison to the good he would do all
the world when he became emperor.
Mr. Wiiliam Lamb once made himself appear
very ridiculous by an appearance at the police
office, Bow- street, to bring a frivolous charge
against a discharged female servant of Lady
Carolines ; for this he got ridiculed and laughed
at in all the papers of the day, and I recal the
matter now to recollection, as an additional
proof of the innocence of that lady as to any
inproprieties of conduct such as Harriette Wilson
insinuates ; for this woman so accused had really
been illtreated by her mistress, and by way of
retaliation, would not have let slip such an oppor-

### Page 213

tunity of propagating slander, if she had the
smallest foundation for it.
I only am surprised that Mr. W. Lamb, who
then evinced such tenderness for his wife's reputation
is now so callous. Why does he not , I
repeat the question , prosecute the Caliban of the
Collonnade. I have heard a lawyer say, that
Lamb could do so successfully, and as the law
of the Temple is represented by a Lamb proper,
would seem to point out the right course of proceeding.
But whether he take this legal advice
or not, something is requisite to be done to stop
their scurrilous pens. In a number recently published,
it is written, " that Lady Caroline had made
a conquest of the Duke of Wellington , and that
she is not very nice in her choice !" This is
monstrous. N'est ce pas , messieurs.
Apropos, I should like to know of Miss Wilson,
if she did not send to the Duke for 300%.,
threatening in case of non-compliance to write
anathemas against his moral reputation ; and if
the Duke did not send her back her letter with
" write and he d -d," written in red ink on
the back of it ?

### Page 314

These gross attacks upon character, commonly
of the most exalted kind, have been carried
farthest in the case of the Marquis of Worcester,
and his connexion with her. To him
and to his family she recurs again and again, as
often as her pen lags for food to exhaust its gall
upon. Neither does she spare his venerable
father, whom she represents as eccentrically
turning the conversation from his son to her
foot ! Her vanity knows no bounds. I do not
believe the Duke of Beaufort ever called on her
once for any purpose ; had he done so , I should
most certainly have heard of it at the time, since
it would be too grand a thing to be passed over
by the Wilsons, who proudly enhance every
petty matter of the sort. Besides, she allows
that the Duke had nothing particular to say,
but to talk ridiculously ; and as to her arrogant
vaunting about her influence over his son ,
when the Marquis of Worcester went to Spain
with his regiment, so far was Harriette from
urging him to go, she did all in her power to
make him remain behind.
" Let others in the field their arms employ,
But stay, my Hector here, and guard his Troy. "

### Page 215

The Marquis's high sense of honour spurned at
the idea of wearing his sword only as a "featherbed
soldier," and to her pressing entreaties to
stay, he turned a deaf ear . At last it produced
a coolness on his part, and Harriette from ogling,
sighing and trying to make him yield by her
smiles, changed her battery and fell sick. She
kept her bed, and had Sir Herbert Croft to
attend her ; she affected to be light-headed , and
raved about Worcester, danger, bullets , battles
and bloodshed, like a tragedy queen. All this
was intended to deceive her medical attendant
into a belief, that the fear of losing her lover
had driven her mad. But her madness was of
a piece with that of Sheriff Parkins, “ mad
with over-cunning like a Waterford merchant ."
Excuse a homely old saying, I have no time to
look in books for comparisons - what first
comes into my head flows to my finger ends.
Sir Herbert Croft having felt her pulse , and
declared it quite " regular though quick," carried
to the Marquis an account of Harriette's pretended
frenzy, and positively said that her intellects
were sound, and if the lady was not

### Page 216

shamming Abraham , as he supposed , he could
only attribute the nonsense she talked to hard
drinking ; and the attendants had acknowledged
to him that she frequently sipped a little rum and
new milk before breakfast, which she qualified
with " cyder and brandy" at her luncheon .
Vexed beyond measure, she dismissed the
physician, after having as a last inducement for
him to aid her deception , offered him the Marquis's
place in her bed. Disgusted with her
profligacy, Sir Herbert reported as I have said
before to the Marquis, but he was so much a
man of delicacy, that he never injured her by
mentioning the vile attempt to seduce him
from his duty.
The Marquis was all this while preparing for
his departure ; but his weakness led him to believe
that she was half in earnest, and he
evinced some feelings of regret at quitting her.
She was fearful indeed of his leaving her ; as she
always flattered herself with the hope, that if
she could estrange him from his family, she
might become Marchioness of Worcester. At
one time, I thought myself she stood a good

### Page 217

chance so firmly had she drawn the leading strings
around him .
She at length made a desperate proposal to
accompany him to the wars : this was done one
evening after coffee, with due theatrical effect ,
by flinging herself on her knees. There were
only Fanny and I besides in the room. She declared
that if he left her, she should die broken
hearted in a month, and she would prefer being
shot by his side , concluding with a scriptural
quotation, (the devil can quote scripture to suit
his purpose, and why not one of his imps also ?)
" whither thou goest I will go, thy people shall be
my people, and thy God my God."
Worcester was moved by her manner, and finally
consented to take her with him : and she
would have gone , as I before said, in hopes of prevailing
upon him, at some weak moment to marry
her.
But, while we were all making "note of preparation"
for her voyage , a letter came from the
Marquis , to state that " it was contrary to regulations
, no officer would be permitted to take a
female companion with him, and the Colonol had
T

### Page 218

given a positive refusal to his entreaties for a relaxation
in his favour." The letter concluded in
these words :-
" You have teazed me into making requests,
that degrade my character as a soldier, and I
have , on your account, more than once, solicited
favours from those I despise. - Now, I have made
up my mind definitively : you shall remain at home
under the care of Mrs. Johnstone , any where in
the country you please, but not in London. I
will allow you three hundred and eighty pounds a
year, and more if I can scrape it together ; but
my appointments are sinking all the ready cash
I can muster , and to mend the matter, Singleton
writes me, that my best and favourite charger
has been killed, by accidentally falling out of the
slings in hoisting him into the Transport. This
mishap , at such a juncture , almost transports me
with madness ;-it will take two hundred and fifty
guineas to replace him , which should have been
yours. Remember, if you chuse to quit the
country , H- - has power to stop your allowance
immediately and if you are in that state I

### Page 219

wish, and you say you are, -quiet is necessary to
prepare for an event, which may bind me more
closely to you than ever.
I would recommend you to look for a small
cottage near Bridport, where you could have the
society of Mrs. Henderson and her daughters ,
Julia's sincere friends , whom you used to admire
so much ; you could then receive your allowance
in quarterly payments, at the Bank of " Messrs .
FOWLER and Good," to whose care I might address
my letters , or any thing else I have to send
you- for absence will not make me forget you ,
though for many of your tricks , you deserve to be
a little neglected by
Romford Barracks.
Your faithful
WORCESTER.
The matter being thus in a great degree left
to me, I offered my advice very candidly , made
every inquiry, and discovered that the Marquis
had been enabled to settle this handsome allowance
upon her, by his Uncle's liberality ; on the

### Page 220

express condition , that, war or no war, he should
remain three years on the continent.
There was no probability of peace, and the
Marquis had an honourable desire " to gain a
name in arms ! " The arms of a hussey had too
long enfeebled both his mental and bodily powers,
and I was cordially glad to see him aspiring
to that rank amongst the young military nobility
his name and fortunes so justly entitled him to.
He always placed great confidence in me ; and I
declare to God, it was the respect and gratitude I
entertained for him, that made me at this time
resolve to endure Harriette's disagreeable temper,
try to act the monitress to her in the country--
where I knew she would be doubly ill -tempered ;
for to her-
" Green fields , and shady woods, and murmuring
springs ,
And Larks , and Nightingales were odious things. "
The preceding extract from the Marquis's letter,
I have freely given , though it displays his
weakness, and exposes his folly, when this woman
was in question, and for which he had youth and

### Page 221

inexperience to plead in excuse , and the example
of his brother officers and companions ; who I am
sorry to say , were all of them , without exception
more or less , led by the nose by women of pleasure
and profligacy. Harriette assumed a look of
settled melancholy, or pious resignation, and
yielded to all the Marquis said ; it was " patience
per force," and she solemnly promised me to behave
as became her during his absence ; for I declared,
even if it cost me her acquaintance , that I
would acquaint the Marquis with any misconduct
of hers , wherein the male sex was concerned ,
upon his return.
She became completely changed, avoided all
company, and devoted her whole time to the Marquis,
as he did to her ; she abandoned all her trifling,
and looked like- like what ? —
"Patience on a monument
Smiling at grief. "
Our evenings were rationally spent, with music
and agreeable conversation, and for three weeks
previous to the Marquis's leaving us , domestic

### Page 222

calmness shed its blessings around our little
society. I verily believe , that had Harriette
acted thus at their first connection , she might
have now been Marchioness of Worcester ; for he
of all men I ever knew, was the most partial to
fire-side comforts , and rational society.
I was not a witness to the parting betwixt our
Hector and Andromache, but I dare say it was
sufficiently pathetic and sentimental on her part,
sincere and silly , on that of the Marquis. He
presented her with a fifty pound note, which I am
sure he could very ill spare ; and no sooner was
the news confirmed of his being gone, than the
lady penserosa threw away her hypocritical
mask, and decked her face once more in perpetual
smiles.

Having sold off all the elegant furniture, and discharged her lodgings, she went to pass a few days with her sister's, previous to our departure for Devonshire or Dorsetshire, for we had determined on neither place yet.

At Amy's she made an attack upon the heart of young Meyler , an accomplished rake, with a large fortune, and little prudence. While the

### Page 223

Marquis was at home, he had been her admirer, a la distance, and now at close quarters, urged his pretensions with ardour.

Harriette kept him in play, as anglers do a trout in the stream, which they draw to land at will, when tired of the amusement. My visits to Amy's were seldom, as I went for a few days to see my dear children , about nine miles from town. When I returned, Amy took especial care to tell me, that Harriette was in a fair way to forfeit the Marquis's annuity before.

She had received the first quarterly payment; for that she had been flirting with Meyler at all public places, and had slept at home only once, since I had left them. I expected all this, and more, and was prepared with my remedy accordingly.

One story was, that Lord Yarmouth had discovered her and her youthful lover in the Merino Temple, Kensington Gardens, and had made no secret of the affair. It was earnestly reported for an undeniable fact, in every dashing circle, and no doubt was very true. I reminded her how necessary it was for us to fulfil our engagements with the Marquis, as to residing in the country, and leaving the blandishments of a town life. And

### page 224

she requested three days to get ready, to which I assented.

I afterwards learned, that these three days were devoted to the honourable purpose of getting Mr. Meyler to make a settlement upon her, equal to that the Marquis had made , and then she would have thrown off the latter, and remained in her darling town; - for she detested being buried in rusticity - She had no idea of ruralising.

Meyler, who knew her will, made an offer to take her a handsome lodging, and give her the use of his equipage, paying her forty pounds per month whilst she kept herself constant to him, and no longer. The latter article she knew she should break, and therefore, did not chuse to give up the Marquis on such precarious terms.

When all was ready for the start, having forwarded our luggage by coach, she bade adieu to her sisters, and with a smiling countenance entered the post-chaise. I was at a loss to account for this good humour, at parting with all she held dear, the Opera - the Parks - and the Starers of

### Page 225

Bond-street. The conversaziones at Amy's, and the fulsome flatteries of titled fools, and sycophancy of numerous dupes. Nevertheless, she chatted away the time, upon the happiness she expected to enjoy, in making cyder, and cheese, and feeding young lambs , ducks , and chickens.

But this turned out, as I expected, all fudge; for on the road before us, travelled her sweetheart, Mr. Meyler. He pretended to meet us accidentally, at the end of the second stage; and as I could not say, he had not really done so, we accepted of his attentions, and allowed him to order dinner which was more sumptuous than I could have wished.

It was late e'er we rose from table, and he insisted upon seeing us safe to the next town. Sending his servant on with his horses, he squeezed into the post-chaise , "riding bodkin,” as it is called, when a poor governess is stuck up between two Misses, leaning forward on the window, with just an inch of her person on the seat.

"Too much of this," thought I, almost aloud, for my wish was to forget London, and all its fopperies, with which I had long been completely surfeited. Mr. Meyler was an agreeable man

### Page 226

never forward or intrusive, seldom saying a good but never a rude thing. In this respect he was an exception to the behaviour of all our acquaintances; who commonly displayed their high breeding by indulging in tow observations, and a certain rippishness or varmintism of expression, that always seemed to me well calculated to evince that they entertained no respect for us, the pretended objects of their adoration. But those "Lords of the creation" comport themselves towards each other occasionally in the same manner: I remember an anecdote of the Prince and old Sheridan to this point, which was told me by Sherry had drunk Colonel Cotton. very freely, and descended naturally from polished wit to coarse punning,

The Prince frowned at some dirty observation he had made, when Sheridan, as an excuse said, "I hope, your Royal Highness, there is little harm in being now and then a little of the blackguard.'

'None,' replied the Prince, 'but great harm in being oftener than now and then, too much of the great blackguard.'

Mr. Meyler catered for us at supper time, and took leave sooner than I expected. I was glad

### Page 227

when I saw him mount and wave adieu, as he rode out of the inn-yard; and Harriette and I
immediately retired fatigued to our separate bed chambers.

I am not partial to sleeping with any one, though it is agreeable to many of our sex. I, for my part, generally retire to rest, and not to talk nonsense; moreover, Harriette was a perfect night-mare in the same room with you, taking as much pains in doing up her fine hair, and folding her laced night-gown and cap, as though she were preparing for a ball-room. I once remonstrated with her on the folly of spending two hours thus, and then waking me out of my sleep , to give my opinion how her night clothes became her; whether she looked most like Cleopatra waiting for Antony, or the wife of Potiphar, when trying to seduce Joseph.

Upon one such occasion her flippant reply was - "I would not go to bed for the world except drest elegantly in nightclothes, lest I might die in the night, and not be found a decent corpse in the morning; or suppose there were to be a fire, I should be so like to be admired as I descended the ladder by a gazing crowd below, and find a nice paragraph

### Page 228

on me in the morning's paper."

But the reader required not this additional instance to prove that Harriette was all vanity and frivolity. I can fancy her like Mrs. ---- the lady whom Pope satirizes, giving final directions, on her death bed, to her servant thus:

> One would not sure look ugly when one's dead,
> And, Betty, give this cheek a little red;
> And let a charming chintz and Brussell's lace,
> Shade my cold limbs, and wrap my lifeless face.

At the inn, she had other motives for retiring to bed sooner than ordiniary; for the departure of Mr. Meyler turned out a ruse de guerre on his part: he returned and slept with the Marquis of Worcester's faithful mistress all that night and part of next day, for she did not rise till eleven o'clock .
This intrigue I was not made acquainted with
till long after. The nods and whisperings of the
servants at the inn next morning, made me
wonder what had been done to cause such freedoms
; but I attributed it to our having lost our
beau the preceding night , and Harriette's levity
of behaviour, which told too plainly what we
229
were or had been. I have always remarked the
truth of that old saying, " Once a goal -bird ,
always a gaol- bird ." So with women ,—once a
woman of the town , always so the bold stare ,
the wanton leer ; the forward , presumptuous
step , the wanton bend of the body, and careless
modesty-defying handling of the drapery, are
practices difficult to be dispensed with ; and a
woman after being long accustomed to male
society, appears very awkward when raised to an
honourable station amongst her own sex, and is
certain of being detected by the eyes of those
who never descended from high life and decorous
behaviour.
On the most trivial , as well as most important
occasions, the same betrayal of loose habits
escapes persons of our class. Harriette once
nearly betrayed her calling in the country , as
we were going to church , by holding up her leg
on passing a stile , and desiring the clergyman to
fasten her boot-lace . He had been once a dasher
on London streets , and very gallantly complied
with her request , saying with a smile, " Don't
your gaiters want tightening my love. ?" I could
have brained her with my fan through vexation.
U
230
A similar story , Lord Yarmouth (I believe)
used to relate of Phipps the occulist, whom Lady
Howe married. He was a consummate puppy,
with manners between a footman and a dancingmaster.
A lady, who visited the mansion near
Putney Bridge, and was on familiar terms with
the family, had seen something with her eyes
which she was proceeding to relate , observing,
" Come nearer, Mr. Phipps , there has something
struck my eyes to-day as very uncommon , which
I want you to explain. "-" Indeed, my Lady,"
said the fool, bridling up beside his antiquated
partner, " I would recommend you to go to
Stephenson, for I never does nothing for nobody
in a professional way since I married Lady
Howe. "
Now I am upon this occulist and aurist of
ridiculous notoriety, I will give a copy of verses,
which were written upon his marriage, by a lady
now retired from fashionable life , but once the
intimate friend of an illustrious personage , whom
she deceived , and exposed in a way not likely
soon to be forgotten by those who admire honour
in a lady of honour - so titled. The levity of
this thing may be excused , I am no prude, and
231
think there is no harm in indulging my readers
with a little innocent mirth , as a relief to the
tedium of defending and proving, and all that
sort of thing.
VERSES
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY LADY HOWE,
PREVIOUS TO HER MARRIAGE WITH MR .
PHIPPS , THE OCCULIST.
" Yes - I long for the lips-
Of the dear Mr. Phipps ,
The great occulist to whom I must bow ;
To my utter surprise ,
He has charmed both my eyes, -
Would to Heaven , he had not known Howɛ.
But now ' tis too late ,
He has settled my fate , -
Of all others 'tis him I adore ;
So by him I'll be kist ,
For I cannot resist ;
He shall COUCH mè, and then I'll SEE MORE. "
The fellows at the inn kept us so long waiting
for a post-chaise, that we countermanded it, and
threw ourselves into the Exeter mail, which
stopped there to change horses. Harriette has
232
given a long and weary detail of mail-coach oc
currences, when she went in the disguise of a
servant to meet Worcester ; and I merely put in
here this remark, that she might have done such
a thing at some period of her life, but not at the
time she was acquainted with the Marquis, for I
must have known it had it been true . But it is
evident , that she and the Caliban of the Colonnade
are now a book- making, and poor tools they are
at it, god knows .
She does not condescend to say one word of
my accompanying her on this journey, although
to this hour she remembers it with indignation ;
for she was actually under my orders , and could
not receive her quarterly allowanee without my
signing first the check or banker's book for it .
She remained a total stranger to this arrangement
of the Marquis's, until made acquainted with it
by Messrs. Fowler and Good, of Bridport, when
she called for her first quarter's salary unknown .
to me, and finely cut was her self-importance at
the information.
At this distance of time I do not recollect any
particular persons who were our companions in
the coach ; none I am sure worthy of a place in
233
my history of events. Nothing material occurred
on the journey into Dorsetshire , until we arrived
at Moorcom-bissett, a small village not far from
Bridport , where Harriette, through her fatigues ,
was taken ill. For this once, she did not sham ,
but was really so distressed , that I made her get
out of the mail , and enter the public house , a
small thatched building , kept by a Mrs. Shepherd
and her husband ; for the women hereabout , in
this class of life, usually take the command of
the concern upon the well- known principle of
" Grey mare the better horse." We found this
disposition to femate rule, pervade all society
from the squire and foxhunter, exclusively , down
to the meanest shopkeeper and smallest farmer in
the country . Upon one occasion, the apothecary's
wife, hearing that Harriette was handsome ,
would not permit the poor man to feel her pulse,
unless she accompanied him in the visit. I do
not wonder at Harriette forgetting the name of
this village and parish, of Moorcom- bissett ; her
capacity seems to me better adapted to remembering
things that never happened .
The accomodations here were narrow, but every
thing neat and uncommonly clean : we took an
U 2
234
upper sitting- room and a parlour under it , in
which were two beds. These lay back from the
road and were quite secluded from public gaze,
and we had no occasion to enter the busy part of
the house, for a door opened into a pretty garden
and the fields beyond it.
A medical gentleman from Bridport took some
blood from Harriette , and in the course of a few
days she quite recovered . I am not writing a
novel for mere entertainment, so pass over all this
water-gruel and beef-tea description, and other
tattle, which would have served Harriette for a
half-crown number of her " Memoirs ."
The vale of Moorcom-bisset is very beautiful ,
and surrounded by lofty hills ; those to the southward
overlooking the ocean . We were only two
miles distant from " Charmouth, " where my
friend Mr. Henderson and family resided , so
I resolved to remain where we were , and walk
over there to reconnoitre .
Mrs. Shepherd's young daughter was very
assiduous, and served us in every capacity. She
235
told us her tale of misery" at intervals , and it
convinced me, that in the solitudes of rural life ,
there are villains practised in the seduction of
our sex, full as bad , but coarser in their approaches
than any in the metropolis. In fact,
vice in its varied forms is confined to no particular
spot ; though in large towns she has a
wider range than in the country, and has more
lures at command to entrap the unwary.
tent is a more permanent dweller in the country
than real virtue, of which they know but little in
reality. They act rightly from habit, and do
wrong without considering it an offence against
religion or morality, which I take to be very
different things .
Con-
Hannah Shepherd had been seduced by a
young farmer under promise of marriage, which
he avoided fulfilling by leaving the place and
taking a little boy, the offspring of their unauthorised
love, along with him. The girl frequently
wept when she spoke of him and her
child ; and spite of her fall, as the old women
here about considered Hannah's faux pas, I
could pronounce her an innocent creature . By
degrees, Harriette gathered strength to walk up
236
the hills, or ride on old Shepherd's poney ; and,
in the course of those excursions, we formed an
intimacy with a Lieuteuant Devall and his lady,
who resided in a neat cottage on the hill, where
he had the command of a signal station and fire
beacon . The lieutenant was a very handsome
young sailor, and she rather stricken in years.
As it afterwards appeared, he married her for
that bane to all happiness - money ; and tried
to be grateful for what she had given him. She
was good tempered , and in such a place seemed
like a lady.
I went alone to Charmouth , Harriette in the
mean time spending a day or two with Mrs.
Devall. My friends there were delighted to see
me, for which they had been prepared by letters
from the Marquis of Worcester, and small as
their house was, they were prepared to portion
some of it off to receive us . But this movement
of theirs I opposed , and as there were no decent
lodgings to be had in town, I consulted with
Harriette, and we hired a cottage of four rooms
and a kitchen half- way up the hill, betwixt Shepherd's
and the signal post.
237
We remained at Moorcom-bisset while it was
fitting up, visiting and being visited by our friends.
Harriette would fain have gone to Bridport altogether
; but as we intended keeping a small
poney-chaise, she remained satisfied with the
idea, that she could visit it whenever she pleased ,
and Lieutenant Devall offered to squire her and
myself whenever we wished to go over there.
Harriette was delighted to find there was a company
of comedians and a regiment of soldiers
quartered in the town ; and, as we passed for
married women and relations of the Hendersons,
expected nothing less than to be admitted without
ceremony to the assemblies and other public
places .
Harriette had all along deceived me as well as
the Marquis of Worcester, with respect to her
pregnancy, and when I reminded her of it she
laughed at my credulity. However , there would
be no crime in this circumstance, and it passed
away, though in reality it was to return with a
vengeance upon her inconstant head . I recollect
238
a thing not redounding to her delicacy : Harriette
used to delight in calling Colonel Berkeley
" bastard" ; a title he by no means relished to
hear ; but she has not the candour, in her
" Memoirs", which have brought so many wonderful
things to light, as yet proclaimed herself,
the mother of a bastard. She might have done
so with more truth than she has accused others
of much graver offences. Reader, attend to me ,
and I will elucidate this point in a striking
manner.
Poor Hannah Shepherd, the reader is aware,
became our waiting maid, and in the society of
Mrs. Henderson, her daughters , the Lieutenant,
and his wife, we passed a few months , seldom
going further than to Charmouth , to purchase
Prawns, which are caught there uncommonly fine .
At length I observed a growing intimacy betetwixt
Lieutenant Devall and Harriette , which
I endeavoured to check as much as lay in my
power, but all in vain . Her passions were as an
impetuous torrent, which sweeps away all before
it with resistless force , and leaves ruin and desolation
on every side . The reader need not be detained
longer by me upon portracted descriptions
239
in the Radcliffe style , or our rural pleasures ; it is
enough to say, that before the fourth month of
our retirement had ended , Harriette became in
reality-what she had so often spoken of in jest
-in the family-way !
This threw me into a
dreadful state of alarm. By every packet we
were receiving letters from the Marquis ; and to
deceive him , I could not agree, though she hourly
importuned me to comply with her wishes in this
respect.
Such a gross instance of inconstancy, was utterly
revolting to my feelings ; and at I once came
to the resolution, no longer to remain where this
woman polluted the atmosphere itself.
Lieutenant Devall broke squares with his
wife , and now entirely attached himself to Harriette
; so that they became twain , and were always
rambling over the cliffs, in fact, they were pronounced
" the inseparables " by our friends.
I had one day called upon our banker , “ Fowler,
of Bridport," and received from him a pacquet of
letters, which I chose to walk home with , and
reflected on the way, how very wrong I was to
connive as I had done at Harriette's pregnancy.
The sun had sank below the western horrizon ,
240
and left behind her the chequered rays of his luminous
glory, sparkling on the valley of Moor
com -bisset.
All was peaceful , all was still , when I incontinently
sat myself down on a bench , near the
" Spice woman's cottage." Here , lost in contemplation,
I had forgot the world, and all its woes
--when a travelling carriage and four drove up
slowly, and by its side walked an old friend of
mine , Vice Admiral D- . He was no less
astonished than delighted , to find me in such a
romantic situation , and ordering his carriage to
put up at the inn at Bridport , he put my arm
within his, and walked with me to our cottage.
As he and I were ever upon the best terms of
friendship, I disclosed to him how I was situated .
He remained two or three days at Bridport, and
offered me a seat in his carriage to town ; which
I accepted. Harriette and her admirer were so
intimate, not any thing I said could break their
connexion ; so I very unceremoniously left the
cottage, and seated by the side of my old friend,
proceeded town- wards.
I am not going to justify every part of my conduct
; no, I am not such a fool as to attempt it—
241
'twill not stand the test of severe examination ;
it is the major and grosser charges of a darkened
hue, that have been raised by Harriette and her
diabolical coadjutors , that I wish to clear myself
of: had I not some permanent sins to answer for,
I need not make my confessions thus.-I hope
nothing from the common charity of the world,
beyond an expression of pity :-so they hold me
not in utter contempt, I can receive even their
forbearance with gratitude.
When I had settled myself in my house in
town, I began to reflect upon what I had best do.
It was plain I had no room for hesitation : I must
either break my word to the Marquis of Worcester,
and forget his friendship for ever, or let him
know what the conduct of his Mistress had been
--an event I knew would cause him the most
poignant distress ;-but, as to my keeping the
secret for the value of her friendship , that was
quite out of the question . I set no value upon it ;
and yet from our long habits of familiarity , I felt
loath to break with her entirely, whilst a ray of
hope remained by which I could serve her. She
addressed to me a letter, from Bridport, and in
artful terms of humility and repentauce , entreated
X 2
242
me not to ruin all her future prospects , by letting
the Marquis know of her inconstancy. However ,
I had made up my mind ; and in reply, told her,
nothing could prevent me from being true to my
plighted word , and that by next packet, I should
let the Marquis know all that had occurred . No
sooner did she receive my letter , than she took the
extraordinary resolution of going to Spain herself,
thinking , that if on the spot, she could persuade
the Marquis my letters contained falsehoods ; or
at any rate she could try and intercept them, and
prevent them from reaching his hands .
My friends at Charmouth, had avoided her society
; and, therefore, having sold all the household
furniture , and drawn her last quarter's
allowance from the bank-without bidding adieu
to any one- she , accompanied by her maid servant,
Shepherd, set out for Falmouth . So that
the story of her being accompanied by a person
of respectability, is an absolute falsehood . They
arrived at Falmouth , and for some days remained
at the head inn . But her misconduct was so
very glaring, that the master, to save the
credit of his house, ordered her to find another
lodging.
243
Adverse winds kept the packets in harbour, and
she despaired of intercepting my letters to Spain,
which she wisely judged I had sent by a ship
of war.
And a circumstance , to be next related, determined
her upon relinquishing the intention of
making the voyage, and to adopt the more prudent
scheme of trying to make the most of Mr. Meyler,
and the Duke of Beaufort.
---
Whilst she waited in the town, a Transport
arrived in the Bay, having on boad wounded soldiers
from Spain , under the care of a young officer,
named Racher. She got introduced to him ,
and learned, that the Marquis would probably
soon return to England ; and that letters for her
had been forwarded to London. She accordingly
put herself under the wing of Mr. Racher, and
started with him in a post -chaise to town.
I am not bound to conceal one of her faults , as
it will shew how little cause she has to complain
of ill- treatment from the Marquis , or any of the
Beaufort family.- She slept at every stage with
this Mr. Racher, and passed by his name as his
wife ; and as usual, she was so infatuated with
him for a short time, that they lingered on the
244
road so long, when he came to the Horse Guards
he was immediately put under arrest, to answer
for his conduct before a Court of Inquiry . She
cared very little upon this subject :-her lovers
she threw off as indifferently as her shoes-or
trampled upon them without compunction. On
arriving in town , she repaired to my house, and I
put into her hand several letters , all written in
the Marquis's usual tender manner , and enclosing
a draft for a good sum upon the army agent.—
This proved the last money she ever received
from that quarter. I clearly perceived that she
chose to keep on good terms with me from motives
of policy : at the same time , she wished me
with the black gentleman, to whom , in her indignation,
she was in the habit of sending any one
that offended her, in no very delicate words.
She now commenced a renewed acquaintance
with Mr. Meyler , more closely than ever ; and at
the same time, likewise , began a negotiation with
his Grace of Beaufort.
The Duke had always entertained strong suspicions
, that at some unlucky hour, when the
Marquis was thrown off his guard by wine , he
might be induced to marry Harriette ; for he well
245
knew where his son's weak side lay ; but he was
not so well acquainted with his obdurate pride ,
which would prevent him from disgracing himself,
by an alliance with an incorrigible prostitute.-
During this negotiation , I was honoured with several
calls by his Grace, on this business ; but
now, as Harriette's conduct wanted not my interference,
I at length gave orders never to be at
home, when the Duke called .
He certainly had offered to settle an annuity
upon Harriette, as she has stated, provided she
cut the Marquis dead for ever, by forming a
connection with some other person, as said
before.
I left her to pursue her own plans for the present,
assured that the moment the Marquis got
my letters , he would think no more of his flaming
Harriette ; and if he had time to write home, she
would stand no chance of getting her pension from
the Duke.
I could now have done her the greatest injury
imaginable ; yet I only studied how to avoid doing
her cause harm , and at the same time keep
my word with the Marquis . I well knew, that
placed in the same situation, she would not have
x 2
246
so acted by me ; for I never knew her to spare
a female whom she once had within her power.
Envy was a principal component part in her composition.
The Duke entered into her views , and she terrified
him with threats of going to Spain, and
actually made preparations for a journey she
dared not undertake.

Mr. Meyler I found would settle nothing upon her; he knew her insincerity, and therefore only offered his word and honour to bind him so long as she kept her's, which would be only so long as it suited her convenience. After long negociation it was at last agreed, that 300l a year should be settled upon her, to be paid so long as she lived separate from the Marquis.

The agreement was signed and sealed by all parties, and a quarter's salary paid her in advance on the day she put herself under Mr. Meyler's protection, and removed to lodgings in
Somerset Place, New Road. Thus far she was fortunate, as considering what she had done, the transaction was of a swindling nature, and let none blame me for not

### Page 247

warning the Duke of Beaufort what he was doing.

I was under no obligation to his Grace, and to the Marquis I had done my duty-besides, my intimacy with Harriette had prevented me from doing harm, and I would have strained a point of conscience, I believe, rather than deprive her of a chance of independence.

People that have long been in habits of familarity - who have lived under the same roof with each other, and broken the same bread, and drank out of the same cup, absolutely and unconsciously accustom themselves to view each other's vices as merely venial errors; and even when a quarrel may ensue, amongst women no uncommon thing, it is often difficult to persuade the heart to cast off all tender recollections, and shew a decided enmity towards those of so long an acquaintanee, though their conduct may have rendered them unworthy of being benefited by former recollections, when interests were mutual and obligations reciprocal.

No sooner had Harriette placed herself under the guardianship of Meyler, than she found herself a very awkward predicament. Her recent friend,

### Page 248

Mr. Racher, who squired her up from Falmouth, was tried by a court-martial, and sentenced to be dismissed the service. He held his commission in the Commisariat, and had saved no money. He had applied to Harriette to try and avert this catastrophe; but, with her common thoughtless and inhuman conduct, she had never replied to his letters, this fault was one very venial, and such as the commander-in-chief was not likely to have scanned with great severity.

She had friends who could have saved this poor fellow had she chosen to exert herself; but, the torrent of passion she felt for him for a short time, had rolled away, and she cared not for him who had assisted her in toiling through the stream of her difficult situation in a distant corner of the land.

The young man, now cast upon the wide world without a friend, attacked her sensibility in a way likely to make her feel, for he placed her interest and preservation in jeopardy. He addressed a letter to her at my house, and left it open, so that all might see its contents. Some one, well acquainted with Harriette, had advised him to

### Page 249

this step: public shame alone could make her do common justice to any one.

Her conduct to her lovers always reminded me of what I had read of lascivious Kate, the Empress of Russia, whose conduct she copied in more parts than one. The letter just spoken of was to this purpose:

> To MRS. HARRIETTE MEYLER.

> MADAM,
> Every appeal to your tenderness
> having been made by me in vain, I am now
> convinced you have no heart for any one but

### Page 250

> House-if not sent to - morrow will be too late .
> J. RACHER ."

Nothing could exceed the fear and vexation of Harriette when she received this warning epistle. In the excess of her passion, she blamed me for telling Racher the particulars of her situation, though she knew me to be incapable of such conduct ; but wretches like her think every one as bad as themselves.

I had not, in fact , ever seen Mr. Racher, and

### Page 251

was indebted for all the information I received respecting him to Hannah Shepherd, who, quite disgusted with her mistress's conduct, had fled to my roof for protection , and I got her a place in a respectable family, where her early failing was not known.

Harriette took care to send the destitute
youth a small sum of money, and very soon
after got him the situation he desired , but which
he did not long retain , owing to neglect and
drunkenness. I myself had an application from
him for assistance when he became a prisoner in
the King's Bench. I understood , from good
authority, that he was afterwards tried at the
York assizes, and transported ; -thus adding
another victim to the lewd designs and unbounded
passions of Stockdale's Harriette
Wilson . How this creature can sleep sound on
her pillow with such a burthened conscience, is
a matter of astonishment to me ! But very probably,
I may say truly, with Rolla in the Play of
Pizarro, " The balm of sweet repose she never
more can know." Perhaps like a toad, she sleeps
and fattens upon her own venom , in her own
toad's hole.
252
I had forgot to insert in its proper place, an
occurrence at Romford Barracks, in which she
proved , that in soul she was a genuine Scapin―—
that she would not hesitate even to rob, where
that might be done with safety .
Among other acts of her duplicity towards
Worcester, I must not omit to mention the double
barbarity with which she at the same time treated
one Murray, a city manufacturer of cosmetics,
of dentrifices, and a botanical extract for the
hair, with which she profusely laved her tresses
daily, at a vast expense . Indeed, she and all
her family were wholly indebted to the last
mentioned article (which she christened " l'Extrait
Botanique,") for the handsome tresses she
so proudly boasts of in her Memoirs. Twice had
Worcester given her the money expressly to pay
this tradesman, and twice had she squandered
the money in trifles, when on a day Murray's
son became clamorous for his bill . His lordship ,
entering the barrack - gate while this dunning
scene was going on, first demaned the reason ?
and then gave a cheque for the amount- some
1207. or thereabout, and then he walked out
again without making any remark . But Har253
riette must needs inveigle the young man to
" let her look at the cheque , to see if it were
quite right," when she clapt it in her desk ,
" quite safe," said she ; and would have kept it,
but for the return of his Lordship. This check
so ruffled the amiable Harriette, that she never
forgave the Murrays, father and son ; and swore
by her Maker, for l'aimable could swear , that she
" would never use another bottle of his
Extract, nor ought else, made by that greasy
citizen."
However, she swore with a mental reservation,
as I afterwards found ; for whenever my servant
went into the City, as when I went thither to receive
my quarterly allowance, he was always
commissioned to bring her a dozen of that very
Extract to which she had stood sponsor, and ultimately
denounced . So much for her principle.
Harriette says , that the Marquis of Worcester
had taken the paymaster's wife into his keeping ;
which was not true. I do not mean to say, that
" true and constant," to that inconstant
Neither soldier or sailor , can be expected
to prove constant , while they remain separated

woman.
Y
254
from the object of their affections, whether wife
or sweetheart, for years together . Nor, could
any reasonable woman expect human nature to
submit to such a penance.
Indeed , judging of male from female feelings, I
do not believe any man could suffer such a privation,
and yet believe he might at the same time
have the most tender regard for her he had left
behind.
Probably my mind may have been vulgarized
by the society into which I was plunged by my
early deviation from rectitude ; and I will not
pretend to say, that I am a competent judge
of virtuous feeling in generous and unsullied
minds.
The Marquis answered my letter immediately ;
and, to judge from his language, he appeared
deeply affected . He announced his coming
home, which had been settled upon before he
received my letters ; for his motive for returning,
related entirely to family business .
In short , about a month after I had received
this letter, the Marquis one evening came up to
me at the opera―he greeted me very cordially,
255
but looked pale and thinner than usual :-he
squeezed my hand as he sat down, and entered
into conversation on a variety of subjects—but
shunned all mention of that which I supposed
nearest his heart.
When the opera was over, the Marquis offered
me his arm, and we got into a hackney-coach,
and proceeded to my house, where he proposed
to sup.- I sent for a friend of mine, Miss Jolliffe,
who kept her carriage, and lived upon her fortune
in Great Russel Street ; not that I cared one
penny for the world's opinion, when I felt all at
ease within.
After supper, I told the Marquis all I knew of
good or evil, about La Belle Harriette, and
glossed over the worst , in my best manner.
He bore it better than I had supposed he would,
and remarked that absence had given him time
to study her character ; and he now wondered
at himself for putting such implicit belief in one,
whom he knew had "pledged her troth" to many,
and broke it with them all.
We parted at a late, or rather early hour, and
he promised to call in a few days .
256
Miss Jolliffe had received much attention on
this occasion . She was one who could bear any
thing but flattery, from the great ; her heart was
very warm, and her hand never closed against the
just appeal of human mercy.
She had in early life been under the protection
of "The man of the people," Charles Fox ; and
shared , it is said , the smiles of an illustrious personage,
whose boyish days were stamped with
many irregularities . She was a second cousin to
the Perdita, or bird of Paradise, the famous,
beautiful, accomplished, and unfortunate Mrs.
Robinson ; and I believe held her annual income
partly from a family property, and partly from a
pension given by one whom I do not chuse to
She was now in her thirtieth year, but
still eminently beautiful, and quite enamoured of
the Marquis.
name .
Two days after this interview, Harriette called
upon me, all in her airs, and said the Duke of
Beaufort had refused to pay her annuity.— I would
not interfere, and Lord Nugent, who was present,
observed, that with Meyler she could not
want for pension. " But," says Harriette, " it is
my right, and I will have it, and I will see Wor-
044
257
cester to morrow on the business , and expose the
whole family, if I have not justice done me." " If
you had justice done you," said Lord Nugent,
" you would have neither annuity or protection
from any one : I know you my girl."
Harriette never dared to encounter Lord Nugent
; so she assumed a composed air, and tried
to smile him into placidity.
She left her airs, in a note for the Marquis,
which I promised to deliver , when I had oppornity
.
The day succeeding this meeting, I dined with
Miss Jolliffe, and was not a little surprised to find
one of her party was the Marquis of Worcester !
The first glance I caught of him and my friend
together, I felt assured that Harriette had no
more any chance of being reconciled to her once
devoted admirer.
We had a jovial dinner party, and Lord Alvanley,
who seldom tumbled into a thing that was not
good, came and joined us in the evening. The
Marquis of Worcester was not very fond of Alvanley;
he was too gay and volatile , and I had heard
that in his father's life-time, the old fellow carried
Y 2
258
on a cause as Solicitor- General , which deprived
the House of Beaufort of a considerable estate .
Such things are long remembered in families
who have suffered by the keenness, the ability, or
the chicanery of others.
Lord Alvanley jested with the Marquis ; and
at last, screwing up his mouth and his courage,
and looking round with an air of one who expected
praise for saying a good thing , uttered , with
his grave looks , and half natural lisp : -
66 Pray Marquis, when did you see your good
lady ? "
"I have no good lady belonging to me," said
the Marquis.
"No ! then what has become of our old friend,
HARRIETTE ; has she left the land of the living ?
for you know you were always at her apronstrings."
" Oh, I understand," replied the Marquis, assuming
an air of nonchalance, "that she is under
the protection of MEYLER, our friend, the young
M. P."
"Yes," returned Alvanley, " and the world
understands you hurried home from the Penin259
sula to get her from him again , but that she w'ont
budge, and has had the honour of cutting Beaufort's
martial hero ."
"The world lies " said Worcester ; " and he
lies, who dares repeat rumour as truth."
Here Alvanley fell into a state of alarm, at the
Marquis's rising choler, and uttered, in a manner
scarcely comprehensible, -
" I beg pardon- I only heard some whispers ,
and thought no harm in making you acquainted
with them, that you might "—
"Might what ! "
" Do any thing you please, Marquis ; for 'tis a
pleasant affair altogether."
" I don't think so, " said Worcester, "6 so bridle
your tongue ; that lady is no more to me, than
Mrs. Brandon is to you . She and I cut long ago,
and I understand that she has since that , had a
baby. You, and His Grace of Devonshire , are
famous for having families by impure means : I
should not be astonished but a young Alvanley
has been the consequences of my absence ; for
you know I am up to all your waggish ways, and
hope to see you, in some fit of remorse, found a
Lying-in Hospital.”
260
This lively turn to a conversation we were beginning
to fear was growing serious, made us all
laugh ; and none more so , than the object against
whom the sally was directed . For he did not
like quarrelling, being no-wise qualified for it ,
except by wearing whiskers.
Lord Alvanley now began to tell all he had
heard of Harriette , and his communications were
well received ; for wherever women are , there
will scandal, in a certain degree, be welcome .
I found that Miss Jolliffe had caught the Marquis's
attention, and that she was sensible of the
value of her conquest.
I remained after all the company were gone,
and then Miss Jolliffe commenced an awkward
apology to me, for having apparently deprived
me of my beau .
" He was never, my dear Jolliffe, a beau of
mine, we have long been particular friends, but
beyond that, I never hoped, or wished our connection
should extend further. If you find any
real gratification in the society of the Marquis of
Worcester, you are heartily welcome to the introduction
I gave, and therefore, be assured, we can
never be jealous on that score. All I know, is,

### Page 261

that he will never marry any one who has been
in your former situation , and upon other terms ,
I believe, you would not accept of his coun
tenance ."99
Miss Jolliffe's features lighted up at my explanation,
and I saw in them that sort of vain
pride, which would rather be a nobleman's
mistress than a plebeian's wife . I bade good
night, and reflected on a sleepless pillow on the
changes of a few days.
The Duke of Beaufort had twice called since
his son's return , and I had been denied to him.
I now saw no reason for my seclusion , and gave
directions he should be admitted ; and the same
with Meyler, who had sent me four notes in one
day, requesting an interview. I had heard he
was not very much at ease with his newly acquired
mistress ; and that they had even quarrelled
once in public at the opera, where Mr.
Luttrell had turned both into ridicule .
I was wearied of complaints for which I
could afford no remedy. And why should Julia
Johnstone be harrassed with the concerns of
Harriette Wilson, and her admirers ?
My good nature kept my hands full of other

### Page 262

people's business , when I had none of my own to
have called me beyond the threshold of my own
door ; and another circumstance now occupied
my attention . Mrs. Amy had got me to visit
her, and receive some letters for her under
cover to me. She vowed they came from the Duke
of Argyle. She exposed them, and referred to
me for the truth of her asseverations .
I could do any thing for a friend or acquaintance,
but tell a papable falsehood . Accordingly,
when I was called upon by the Duke of Argyle
and his friends , to declare my knowledge of
those letters, I frankly owned I knew not any
thing of their contents, or from whom they
came ; and further , that I believed upon honour,
Amy's account of their contents was by no means
correct, as she never hinted to me they were from
a quarter which her vanity would have led her to
display to me triumphantly.
Vanter de ses
amis, qu'est ce, que de se Vanter ! is a reflection
of the Duke de la Rochefoucault, which Mrs.
Amy (ami) employed as a leading maxim in her
rule of life .
The Duke of Argyle engaged me to write
a letter, contradicting Amy's assertions — he
-
263
called it " a disclaimer ," and it set him upon a
good footing with his friends , which he soon
lost ; for his future connection with Amy , has
been no secret for a length of time.
The Duke of Argyle, I say, once for all, was
one of the best tempered men that ever breathed ;
yet was he for ever getting into scrapes, by doing
good for the worthless, and getting his pockets
picked by those who had art enough to tell him
a tale of woe. Fiction had an effect upon him ,
like what we read that the Arabian Night's Entertainments
have upon the mind of a boy, and
sooner than retract any of his opinions , or run
the risk of being laughed at, he would commit
himself " DEEPER and DEEPER still ."
That Amy had been able to acquire an influence
over the Duke, was chiefly owing to her
pregnancy, which I have every reason to believe
was not occasioned by any act on the part of the
Duke. But men are apt to believe things which
flatter their vanity, though I do not perceive
any thing flattering to honourable manhood in
having a natural child laid to his account by a
harlot.
### Page 264
I now proceed to the last number of Harriette's
Memoirs ; at least to the last part of her third
volume . It is , like all the others , full of fable .
But to read the following facts, and expose the
deformed features it is meant to hide, is what I
profess to do, and have in some instances , I hope ,
done effectually.

About this time I had several visits from a friend of my brother's; and, indead, a distant relation of our family, Major Sibthorp. He was a young man of some accomplishments; having served with great eclat abroad, but where I do not remember. He was decidedly a man of fashion, and one of those general lovers, who are eternally doting and adoring, but never constant to one object for a week together. He took it into his head to be desperately in love with me; and I was not a little amazed when he told me, that Harriette had given him, at his friend Meyler's, an intimation that his addresses would be very acceptable to me.

I had ceased to have confidential interviews with Harriette for some weeks, and own I was vexed at her presumption. When the Major made this declaration, I felt so much hurt that I

### Page 265

burst into tears, and at my urgent request he left house, and in an hour after the Duke of Beaufort's name was announced, as the servants ushered him up stairs. My mind was not in a calm state; and on this occasion his condescension made me more communicative than I otherwise would have done.

Harriette had also deeply hurt my feelings by recommending me as a person of light character to Major Sibthorp. Therefore, when I was questioned, I told all I knew of her connection with RACHER, &c. and the Duke resolved not to continue to pay a pension he conceived had been obtained from him by improper means. With this determination he left me, having first made me a promise to attempt a reconciliation betwixt me and my family; but, unlike a Duke, he never made the trial, nor do I wonder such a humble creature as I am should escape his recollection.

When the first days of the withholding Harriette's pension came, she was, to use all her own slang, "struck all of a heap," and hurried to my house in great agitation. A general blow-up took place; this led to an open rupture between us, which has never since been healed.

### Page 266

Harriette laid all the blame of the Duke of Beaufort's shabby conduct to my charge, who she foolishly imagined had got an influence over him, which I by no means possessed. I believe at that
time he had an esteem for me, on account of my
widely deviating from the usual conduct of ladies
of our description, by shewing a regard for truth
and honour. This is a virtue ladies of the tonish
part of the town scorn to entertain ; though
it is my firm conviction , that where a man is so
very weak as to believe their professions at allhe
would more readily credit them , if they bore
an appearance of simplicity, and had no art whatever
in their composition. For, art will at times
be discovered in defiance of caution on the one
side, and admitted weakness on the other.
Harriette, as I said before , called upon me, and
put herself into a most glorious rage, which had
only the effect of making me smile and laugh
outright, which rendered her ten times more of
a virago. Major Sibthorp came in at the time,
and so rudely took her part, that I gave him a
pretty broad hint of my wishing never to see him
again within my doors, and from thenceforward
I never met him, except by mere accident. If my
267
memory serves me correctly, he soon after sailed
for the East Indies , and was either lost on the
voyage, or got killed on his arrival. Notwithstanding
all this , he had many good qualities , but
they were lost, and laid dormant, for want of
energy to rouse them into action . Had he lived,
I doubt not but he would have come to England in
a few years an altered man , and a credit to all his
friends and acquaintance . Peace to his ashesthe
sweetest tears that are shed , are those with
which heaven bedews the unburied head of a
soldier : Paix au mords, ou Soldat ou matelot !
From the period just named, when Harriette
so Billingsgated me, her pension from the Duke
of Beaufort ceased to be paid , though he sent
her a quarter's salary as a farewell bequest.
The circumstances of her conduct in Dorsetshire,
alone dis-entitled her to this allowance , added to
which her writing to the Marquis who was then
expected was another grand breach of the articles,
for which she could expect no mercy. I apprehend
the Duke feared more the dilemma into
which she might draw his son by her extravagance
, and the probability that he might make a
large settlement upon her at last , more than by
268
reason of any idea that he would disgrace his
noble name by marrying her .
Harriette , however, would not submit to the
loss of her pension without a struggle, and she
put all her papers into the hands of an eminent
barrister, whom I shall not honour by mentioning
the name of he had as little principle as his
client , and would stick at nothing ever so dishonourable
to ensure a long bill of costs .
He made several attempts to intimidate the
Duke of Beaufort, by his processes and letters ;
but all his arts failed , and a meeting which took
place between counsel on both sides , gave a
knock down blow to all our adventurer's golden
hopes ; as several letters , on which the greatest
stress was laid , were found to be forgeries of the
Marquis's hand-writing ; and that letter , which in
her " Memoirs" she says was sent from the peninsula,
by the Marquis to his father, and which
she would have the public believe caused the loss
of her annuity, is one of her numerous fictions—
no such letter having been written. I speak this
from the best authority. Moreover, had such a
letter been sent , she ought to have kept silent on
the subject, as the very sending it, goes to prove
### Page 269

that the Marquis wanted to get rid of her, since she had long ceased to have that powerful influence over his mind, she boasts of returning to the last.

At this period of her Memoirs, in her eagerness to vilify the Beauforts, she for once overshoots her mark. When the Marquis of Worcester arrived in London, he appeared to have made up his mind definitively as to his once dear Harriette, and declared to me he would never even speak to her again upon any account, be the consequences ever so disagreeable.

Harriette's connection with Mr. Meyler continued "off and on" for a long time, he was not by any means an ill-natured man, as she says of him; but he was certainly subject to sudden starts of passion, and she delighted to throw him into them, fortunately for her -

> She was yoked to a lamb,
> Who carried anger, as the flint does fire,
> Which straight enforced shews a hasty
> Spark and then is cool again."
> ~ SHAKESPEARE.

For he never bore malice, and the establish

### Page 270

ment near Lisson Green was kept up at a great expence of servants and equipage; indeed, too great, when we consider, that Mr. Meyler had another town house on his hands. He long afterwards felt the effects of his profusion - the mines of Potosi could not support an expence like that.

I knew him to be running the usual rounds of

> Women and wine, game and deceit,
> That make the wealth small and the wants great.

Harriette's teazing disposition made Mr. Meyler often leave her; and she did once hunt him down to the country, where she no sooner got from him a sum of money, than she returned to London to squander it in gew-gaws.

Her behaviour in the country evinced so much levity, that he resolved upon keeping a close eye upon all her future movements, and set a watch upon her in town.

At this period of her career, she flies off in her "Memoirs," at such a tangent, that I am quite puzzled how to pursue her meanderings. She will

get up little tales occasionally; and one, about her being invited, *solus, to apetit soupe*r* by the Marquis of Hertford, who was then only Lord Yarmouth, is I fancy a *ruse de guerre*; for I, who am described as one of the intruding party at this picnic, never entered Lord Yarmouth's house by a secret door in my life. The whole story is meant to make believe, that the Marquis, whose indifference regarding her, she often complained of, was enamoured of her charms; that she rejected his advances, and made a jest of him, by producing three persons instead of one, by a kind of religious fraud.

Of a similar nature is all her paltry nonsense concerning Lord Ebrington, who at the time she "cocked her cap" at him, used to say, "She was too impudent for England; but would suit well some part of Asia, I forget where. He referred to a country, where the custom was for ladies to court the men, and even go to their bedchambers."

The real cause, and only cause, of HARRIETTE'S JOURNEY TO PARIS I will relate as near the truth as my memory serves me, and where I am at a loss I will throw the balance in favour of her veracity. She fills up a considerable portion of one book with the tale of Sir Henry Mildmay, whom she pretends "Julia" was in love with. I must go to the beginning. Now, I certainly did at one time think he was a very handsome and very agreeable man; and if to meet him with pleasure and part with him with regret, be carrying on an intrigue with a man, then I am guilty - for such were the feelings I long entertained for Sir Henry Mildmay.

He was a warm admirer of beauty in every shape, from the most delicate white to the most shady brunette, and he might have pushed his generalism so far, perhaps, as the red Indian and black African, for aught I know. Certainly, he was liberal to all, with his compliments and cash, more, perhaps, than he had a right to be.

His conduct in running away with the Countess

### Page 273

of Roseberry is not justifiable; but he paid dearly for a bad bargain. Twenty thousand pounds is, I think, more than the worth of any woman that makes a false step, particularly when she has a family of young children looking up to her for a virtuous example. The lady has since, I understand, given him cause more than once for repenting his bargain. I am a tolerable judge, I apprehend, how those matters ought to bear.

I know that he detested Amy, and was indifferent about Harriette, who persevered in making love to him whenever they met. Nevertheless he was so good humoured, that he never gave a repulse to woman's advances; and I have heard him say, speaking of ladies who admired him "I cannot restrain their passion, for I cannot force my own nature, by G-d. I feel deeply grateful to the pretty creatures for their good opinion."

Harriette had often met the "Divine Baronet," as she termed him — she had always some fulsome appellation to bestow on her favourites, at my house; and, as my esteem for Sir Henry, never rose so high as to make me any way the least

### Page 274

jealous, I was in the habit of sending for her, whenever he made one of my party.

Here let me say, that I have not troubled the reader with an account of my quarrels with Harriette, and reconciliations, as they would only disgust in the relation.

Sir Henry, was at last roused by Harriette's addresses, to fancy she was worth looking after; and he went to Mr. Meyler's pretty often, in order to further his object. Meyler and him had not been on the most friendly footing: but Sir Henry could be like Cesar, "All things to all men."

Aye, and to all women, too, whenever he pleased. As his face would make its way into any society, he soon gained ground in Meyler's opinion; and in less than a month, after Sir Henry set about making himself agreeable, they became inseparables; and were seen in the Park in each other's Barouche, and at the Opera in each other's Boxes, alternately. So true it is, that steady perseverance will overcome the greatest obstacles.

### Page 275

I foresaw what would be the end of this sudden friendship; but I had no just right to guard either gentleman, by a disclosure of my presentiments.

Harriette concerted some private meetings at my house, with Sir Henry ; and they had several times (in my absence) spent a short time together in my drawing room. Her own sister Fanny, who I believe felt a little hurt on the occasion, discovered to me this mode of intrigue, and I instantly discharged my servant, who had been bribed to secrecy; and at the same moment wrote to the intriguing parties to say, if any attempt was made to repeat it, I should mention it in a quarter, where the consequences might prove most unpleasant.

They both roundly asserted their innocence, like condemned culprits ; but I did not chuse to say, I disbelieved them both, in toto, which I most certainly did, and do.

> When lovers meet by stealth so strong,
> Tis not to dance, or sing a song.

So said the Poet, who knew these things very well indeed.

### Page 276

Not long after this event took place, which Harriette has made quite an innocent occurrence, she went of an evening, to the opera, with myself, and one of her sisters; and about the middle of the performance, Mr. Meyler came in; he was a little elevated with devotion to the jolly god, and mildly requested Harriette to go home with him. This she flatly refused, and thereupon he said,

"Why, you know I am going into the country to morrow, and I should like for us to spend this evening slone."

"If you were going to the devil to night,” replied she, "I would not move till the Ballet is over. Besides which, I have twenty friends to see."

"Oh, if that be the case, then to your friends I leave you, and I shall set off in an hour, so adieu."

Mr. Meyler then shook hands with me, and hurried away.

Harriette made very light of the matter, and Sir Henry Mildmay coming in, she soon informed him of Mr. Meyler's conduct, adding, "I know he will be as good as his word. He

### Page 277

has served me so before, and will return when his fit is over."

After the curtain fell, she accepted Sir Henry's offer to set her down from his carriage; and away they both went, the already guilty wretches. But in place of going they proceeded to the Key; then a well-known brothel in Chandos Street, and supped, and retired.

Mr. Meyler, who repented of going into the country, went home about four o'clock in the morning, where he found no bird in the nest, but on the drawing droom table, a note from his faithful valet, whom he had ordered to have an eye upon all Harriette's operations, to acquaint him, that he had watched, and housed the parties at the Key; where he was on guard, near the door, to continue the pursuit, in case they should re-appear after supper 

Mr. Meyler immediately repaired to that temple of gross sensuality, and found that the happy couple had long been gone to repose. Here he sat down cooly to a bottle of champaign, and was soon joined by his friend, Harry Dyer, the Northampton buck, and they proceeded to discuss this affair, and the bottle, with all due hilarity.

### Page 278

A fifty pound note induced the night waiter to point out the room where the lovers were still enjoying repose, on a fine mild-may morning; and with the assistance of his faithful servant, the door was forced open by a single effort. The noise this boarding made, naturally aroused the two devotees to Venus; and when Meyler, Dyer, and the valet, James , armed with pokers, stood in the middle of the room, they were faced by Mildmay, who had sprung in his shirt on the floor, whilst Harriette had risen bolt upright in bed, rubbing her eyes, like one "looking seven ways for Sunday."

The assailants all burst into loud laughter, and then retired, before Sir Henry could speak a word; so completely had his fortress been carried by surprise, or as Wellington would despatch it by a *coup de main*.

Meyler had unfortunately, in a fit of love and the bottle, (and that was at the time unknown to me, for both parties had kept it secret) made a settlement of 300l. a year, upon Harriette; to be her's as long as she continued true to his honour, and her's for ever, in case he married. He had repented of this conditional deed, and he now had

### Page 279

witnesses to prove that it was broken on her part, therefore, no longer binding on him. He had long suspected her of inconstancy, and therefore bore no enmity to his friend, Sir Harry - who in this instance, had proved a friend, in undoing the deed. Meyler well knew Sir Harry was not the seducer; and he ultimately behaved to his quondam mistress, with a generosity few would have practised, after such a palpable discovery of her treachery aud disgusting lewdness.

He made her a present of the household furniture and equipages, which were extremely valuable. To Sir Henry Mildmay he wrote a note, from my house, of which the following is a correct copy. These things are laughable even at this distance of time; and whilst they correct Harrietle's Fables, do no harm to any one else I should not give them to the world with a smile, as I now do.

Sir Henry called at my house in the course of the day, for this letter had been sent on the day of discovery, but Meyler was then on the road to Dover; this, probably, prevented a duel , for
they were both hot heads, and had fought before .
As it was, Mildmay laughed heartily at the occurrence,
and said he never had any intention of
taking the lady under his protection .
When Harriette found she had nothing to hope
from Sir Henry, she set a story going, that the
parties had combined foully to detect her, in or281
der to deprive her of the annuity. But no one
credited her who knew her ; and she endeavoured
in vain to make us forget her insults at the opera,
on that unlucky night. She disposed of her
things, and in the silly hope of once more bringing
her bird back to the cage, from which he
had so ludicrously escaped , with only the loss of
a few feathers . She set out for Paris alone .
This is the real truth ; and all her stories of
" mutual agreements," of " independence as to
action ," betwixt her and Meyler, are as true as
" Gulliver's Travels ," or the " Memoirs of Madame
Genlis ," the harlot school- mistress.
If this exposure does not incense her to the
highest pitch, she must have changed her disposition
with her fortunes, and become all humility,
and weak-heartedness.

At Paris, I was informed on this occasion, that
she took up her lodgings opposite the hotel where
Meyler was residing ; and she actually got again
acquainted with both him and Sir Henry Mildmay.
But they treated her always as a common
lady ofpleasure, and she never could form any
closer connection with either.

### Page 282
How unfortunate for this woman it is , that she
had not left me alone in my state of obscurity ! She
then might have obtained credit for many things
that so keenly affect her vanity ; and in some few
instances the world might have believed her to
be an injured woman : now, however , she is
" All deformed and black
As Othello's visage, and totally without
A ray of hope to gild the gloom. ”
I have reason to rejoice , that time has had no
effect upon my understanding or impaired my
memory ; and that I feel I have strength to
defend both myself and others from this ruthless
destroyer of male and female reputation— this
brigande of peace and happiness on earth !
I have now to speak upon a subject which is
painful to myself. It relates to some transactions
of my early days.
Let me premise that in the course ofmy periodical
publication, numerous testimonials to my
statements have reached me ; some of them
highly flattering and some commendatory . I have
283
also received several letters from the great and
powerful, the honourable and wealthy ; but as
they reached me under the injunction of secrecy,
I will never betray the names of the writers. One
communication, however, which now lies before
me, came to my Editor and Publisher, in a twopenny
post cover, and without any such reservation,
it mentions my name with respect, and the
person signs his own name and place of abode.
Such carelessness either indicates a contempt for
me, which that person ought to know that I do
not merit, or conveys a hint that he thinks my
name may be made free with, sans peur, and
that he can have nothing to dread in doing so.
If his object in wishing to have a personal interview
with me, were intended to induce me to
speak favourably of him, he could not have
adopted a more insane mode of proceeding, to attain
his end ; but, as I know that he has never been
attacked by Harriette Wilson , his name should
not have appeared in these " Confessions," but
for his own obtrusion on my privacy. Thus , as
I know he has not been scandalized by Harriette ,
he can only have one of two motives for wishing
to see me : the first of them may have been of
284
a base and criminal nature ; which , I conceive
the years to which we are both arrived , would
render such an idea very foolish indeed ; though
some men, it must be allowed , carry their vices
into the grave unimpaired . The second cause
must spring from curiosity, to see the alteration
Time may have made in those features he once
seemed to think worth admiring ; and in either
case, the motives are far from partaking of a
kindly feeling.
To give me pecuniary aid it could not be , as
the person is aware I want no help from any one;
and if I did I could on application receive it from
my family. Who, I may add , but for these
" Confessions" would have forsaken me, as the
guilty thing Harriette Wilson made me appear
in her " Memoirs ." However, to prevent the
person from speaking or thinking ill of me, I give
his letter and my reply, and beg leave to say,
that I am not offended with him for the conversation
he held with my publisher, Mr. Benbow ,
who spoke my real sentiments, and did me justice
as to my future intentions .

LETTER I.
FROM GENERAL DANICAN TO THE PUBLISHER .
SIR,
Adam Street, Adelphi,
May 11 , 1825 .
Having read in a work published by
you, the name of Julia Johnstone, I am actuated
by honourable motives towards her. I take the
liberty of enclosing a letter for that lady, and
beg of you to forward the same immediately.
I am, Sir,
Your most obedient humble Servant,
AUG. DANICAN. ”
Pray put the direction on enclosure .
LETTER II.
(THE INCLOSURE.)
" The favour of an interview of a few
minutes with Mrs. Julia Johnstone would be received
by General Danican with as much gratitude
as satisfaction , having something to communicate
to her.
286
General Danican hopes Mrs. Julia Johnstone
will remember , he had the honour of knowing
her, at his house, No. 11 , the Polygon , Somers-
Town, and also at Arlington Place . Since then
he has had the misfortune to lose his good and
virtuous wife , and lives now in Germany, to
which country he is going back in the course of a
few days .
No. 6, Adam Street, Adelphi,
May 11 , 1825.
To Mrs, Julia Johnstone .
G. C. & P."
P.S. General Danican had no other means
to write to Mrs. Julia Johnstone than sending this
Letter to Mr. W. Benbow, 252 , Holborn. *
Such, my reader, are these curious epistles.
The General says in his first letter, " his motives
are honourable ." But I have been so long deprived
of " honour or virtue, that I do not expect
to be treated with honour by any part of
the world, and it is for that reason I have retired

General's Epistles, may have a sight of them upon application

287
from it altogether. To the enclosure for myself,
I sent this answer.
LETTER III .
MRS . JULIA JOHNSTONE TO GENERAL DANICAN .
" The receipt of your letter, General , has
given me considerable uneasiness - it brings to
memory the recollection of other days, when, as
far as regarded your family, I was often very
happy , both at the Polygon and Arlington
Street, but the years of sorrow, I have since endured,
renders every thing that alludes to these
circumstances distressing indeed .
" As to the gratitude and satisfaction of
which you speak, I hope you do not mean to
speak ironically, neither you nor I owe each
other any gratitude , and it can be no satisfaction
to so gallant a man as General Danican to
have an interview with an old woman.
" I have recovered , amongst new acquaintances ,
a new reputation , and in a great degree am restored
to my own good opinion , and that of my
family. I should lose both again if I consented
to see one I so well knew, when life and love was
### Page 288
gay and young, for however harmless our intentions
, there are those who might put upon them a
bad construction. I had heard of the death of
your good lady, and also of the marriage of your
beautiful daughter to Mr. Warre, brother to the
M. P. I am sorry to hear that he now lies
very lamentably ill at his house in Brompton-
Square. You will perceive from this, that I
have means of knowing of their welfare, in whom
my heart still retains an interest .
" I have resolved never to see any one who
knew me when I was unhappily connected with
Miss Wilson, and as you are not one of the
exceptions, I beg you will trouble me no more.
" If Miss Wilson in any future number of her
Book, assails your name, and brings it into contact
with my own, so as to compel me to notice
it, I will do you justice where I can, but never at
the expence of truth , and no interview with me
could make me alter my fixed resolution- to be
governed only by the honest dictates of my own
heart, in the compilation of " The Confessions"
of
Your obedient Servant,
JULIA JOHNSTONE. "

### Page 289

Having disposed of General Danican to the
satisfaction of my own breast, I shall conclude
that subject by saying, that even should Har
riette attack him (which is not improbable after
this ) I hope his gratitude will not induce him to
come from Germany, to obtrude any more upon
my privacy, for I rather think he would not have
much to thank me for , as I will tell falsehoods
for no one, nor for any consideration . However,
as the general's lady is gone to her long
account . he need not feel miserable at that sort
of censure a Harriette Wilson resorts to, for
the purpose of gaining pecuniary benefits , and
destroying all fire-side happiness .
Harriette has endeavoured all throughout to
degrade and vilify Lord Alvanley, frequently recurring
to his name, as if done incidentally. She
says, that he lent books to Mr. Meyler, which
Lord F. Bentinck " would have called very
loose." The meaning of course is well understood.
But , in fact, Lord Alvanley had no
library, and seldom read ; besides, Mr. Meyler
was so correct in his ideas of decency , that he
could not bear it even in jest.
He once said , when an Earl, whose name I do

### Page 290

not choose to mention, was sporting with Amy,
and both were throwing out things more indecent
than double entendres, Obscenity is at all
times very disgusting, but it is really horrible
when coming from the lips of a young and pretty
woman , and an infirm old man tottering on the
brink of the grave."
This reproof silenced them both for the time ;
but to this hour I fear they are not permanently
changed for the better . Harriette once put into his
hands, a volume of poems, that had been privately
circulated , and was said to be written by Burns,.
the Scottish poet . Mr. Meyler scarcely glanced his
eye over the volume, when he flung them out of
the window, and told her, " She ought to be
ashamed of such conduct.
If the reader looks in page 267 of vol. iii. ,
Benbow's edition of her Memoirs , he will find
her speaking of a Mr. Charlton , as being concerned
with Horace Seymour in the seduction of
two young girls . I very well recollect that these
two seduced young ladies turned out to have
been upon the town for some years, but had gone

### Page 291

into the Magdalen, and came out to resort to
their old profession , with more cunning and
caution than before.

I knew poor Charlton very well : he was a mild ,
good-humoured, jesting fellow, and like Tom
Tackle, he had but one fault-he was poor. But
like Tom , he would share his " last shilling"
with a friend , and run a mile in the rain to do
any one a piece of service. He and Lord
Alvanley were upon very friendly terms. In
page 70 and 71 of the same volume , she makes
Lord Alvanley threaten Charlton , and represents
the latter as afraid of him ; concluding her
nonsense with a quotation from Watts's Hymns ,
which adds another wreathe of infamy to her
name, and entitles her to the sad eminence of a
blasphemous creature. In truth , she glories in
her infamy : if the reader will go back to page
260 , and reads from the paragraph, commencing

" Once Meyler got into a desperate rage, and
declared me to be such a loose profligate, & c."
he will find that she justifies her common prostitution
of person . She also there says :
" There exists not the man or woman who can

### Page 292
prove I was ever unfaithful in my life, while I
professed truth, and while I believed others true
to me."
Reader, if you have attended me all along, you
will know I have most triumphantly done what
she dares people here to do . She never did profess
real truth , and whenever she cast her eyes
upon a man with whom she wished to be intimate ,
she generally made an excuse, that her keeper
was untrue to her. This reminds me of what
Colonel Cotton once observed regarding Napoleon:
when he and Talleyrand were consulting on
the Treaty of Peace with England, " Oh ," said
Talleyrand, " had we not better have a private
article drawn up betwixt us and Russia, which
we can produce as an excuse to break this
treaty when we think necessary ."- Nonsense,"
replied the little great man , "let the grand
thing go as it is , and whenever I find it convenient
to break it, let me alone for finding an
excuse for so doing. "
Harriette was at this period of her life a
perfect diplomatist among strumpets , and could
reak her treaties with as much nonchalance as
a Napoleon.
293
In page 273 of the same volume, she becomes
once more a blue stocking , and observes, " I will
finish writing my play, I took it from Moliere's
Malade Imaginaire, but it was by no means a
literal translation . " I believe not, for now she
has, as the reader may perceive, no grammatical
knowledge of the French language ; and though I
took great pains to instruct her , she was a very
silly scholar , and never would do more than
learn like a parrot to speak by rote those
fashionable phrases and cant sayings , practised
only by the English, and which she thought
calculated to give her momentary eclat in company
I remember her making an acquaintance with
Mr. Young, the highly respected actor, and endeavouring
to get her piece performed . He returned
it with a polite note , and advised her to
do as Mr. Pope recommended to authors,-to
keep
" Yourtea nine minutes and your piece nine years ."
1 The letter she inserts as coming from Mr.
Young is false, and , moreover, Mr. Charles

•
Kemble was not then manager of Covent Garden
Theatre ; for this silly attempt at notoriety happened
in the year 1812 , when his brother was
yet alive . The correspondence with Elliston, I
am morally certain did not take place, for an
excellent reason, he was not then manager of
Drury-lane any more than Kemble was of the
other house. How often has her treacherous
memory betrayed her lies , and laid her open to
scorn and ridicule, and will again and again !
She adverts , for what purpose I cannot comprehend,
to her father wishing to separate from
her mother ; and she speaks of Lord Berwick
wanting to send her mother and the younger
branches of her family to the South of France .
Now her father had long been a pest to all her
friends, and appears to have been a fac simile of
the father of Miss Berkeley Foote, who would
sell his daughter to prostitution without remorse,
and support himself upon their misery . Some of
these " younger branches" had become by Harriette's
advice, very troublesome to Lord Berwick,
who supported the whole flock ; until at
last he was compelled to give them up, except
the two youngest girls , whose minds were yet
295
uncontaminated , and whom he took upon himself
to educate and provide for in life .
The Marquis of Worcester she has again and
again brought forward (see page 280, vol . iii. )
and we have a delicious tale of a French woman
kicking him out of bed . Every one must perceive
, that ladies whose object is gain , do not
make these desperate assaults . She says also ,
that Meyler was more than once kicked out of
bed by her ; but ' tis all as false as hell : the
diminutive creature had not strength to kick a
boy, and Harriette Wilson was even the most
unlikely woman in the world to spurn a male
bed- fellow, at any time. Miss Georgiana Fitzroy
is next aimed at, only because she was
esteemed by the Beaufort family for her beauty,
virtue and numerous accomplishments . Harriette
says " she closely resembled her," but I never in
my life saw two less alike . The one all paint
and perfume, with a hair-dresser's window dangling
round her head ; the other breathing pure
nature, with a modestly retired mien, a beauty
perfectly unadorned , and then
" Adorned the most. "
296
I recollect her well. Lord Glengall denies he
ever “ waited in an adjoining room," when the
Marquis took leave of this lady, and I well know
he disdains a falsehood .
In page 281 she has it thus : " While Lord
Worcester was in town , Fanny permitted him to
visit her for the sole purpose of endeavouring to
make him do something for me."
I can easily clear up this paragraph. Fanny
had, during Colonel Parker's absence in Spain,
quite forgotten herself, and intrigued with
several men for money . Night after night she
might be seen in the Saloons of the Theatres,
arm in arm with Harriette, who went thither to
procure money by the same means ; she had led
Fanny into those habits of thoughtless extravagance,
which finally proved her ruin, as it was
the cause of Colonel Parker abandoning her and
taking away her children . I will not say, Lord
Worcester might not have picked her up at the
opera, and gone to her house : he was a young
soldier, and like all his profession , practised
little self denial as respects the female sex ; nor
do I propose to justify him, only with regard to
297
his unfortunate connection with Harriette, and
this I conceive I have done as much as possible .
Shortly after this , Colonel Parker arrived in
town from Spain, and he resolved to have ocular
demonstration of Fanny's inconstancy , before he
proceeded to extremities , for he could not help
valuing the mother of his children , and trembled
for her degradation. In short, he watched her
at Drury-lane Theatre, whence she and Harriette
set off in a hackney coach, and proceeded to a
house of ill fame.
He communicated this to me the following
morning, and as I detest the office of a " go between"
for any purpose , I consented only on account
of breaking the matter delicately to Fanny,
and sparing what little feeling she had left, to be
the bearer of Colonel Parker's resolution to live
with her no more. Fanny had not resided with
me for three years before this ; though Harriette
avows she was with me at this time. She was
much hurt at the communication , but owned she
deserved it, and I prevailed upon the Colonel to
see her once more at my house. The meeting
took place, and ended as might be supposed , in
the Colonel displaying a proper spirit . I inter298
fering in vain. Fanny shamming faintings and
hysterics , and Harriette launching out in a torrent
of abuse of Parker, which made him quit the
house abruptly, and say " he had done with us
all."
So, all I got for my kind interference was to
be included in the anathema levelled at this
squad of Debouchets. To make Colonel Parker
appear more unfeelingly odious, Harriette gives
to Fanny a prominent part in a bed-room scene
(see page 288 ) which only occurred as I have
above narrated. Fanny has none of those fine
feelings-hers were all blunted by depraved
habits and intemperance . The Colonel's marriage
is introduced to heighten the picture , and
make him out a barbarous man, but in point of
fact , he then had no such thing in view ; nor
did it take place till five years afterwards- three
years after Fanny's imprudence had laid her in a
premature grave.
The high rank Parker now has so honourably
arrived at in his profession, and his great wealth
have exposed him to these attacks , and no doubt
he owes much of them to a refusal to bribe
Harriette to silence.
299
He will thank me for this defence , which he
will esteem the more liberal, inasmuch as he cut
my acquaintance at the time he did Fanny's , without
any just cause . If he has time betwixt his
duty at the Horse Guards, and Windsor, to read
these pages, he will be sorry for his usage of one
who has returned good for evil, and now wants
neither his countenance, fortune , or friendship.
It may be well in this place , to trace the decline
of Fanny till she died at Brompton , as Harriette
truly relates in the first number of her Memoirs ,
when Lord Yarmouth gallopped to town to procure
her some eau de cologne.
3
Colonel Parker settled upon her 50%. per
annum, justly observing, " that more than the
absolute necessaries of life he could not then
afford her, and more would do her harm." The
reader will readily suppose, that she did not
merit even this from the Colonel's hands.
She joined Harriette, and they only kept up
an appearance of steadiness for a short time.
Fanny had contracted a penchant for strong
liquors, and frequently indulged in them to the
same degree of excess that her sister Harriette
did in the King's Bench , and does now in Paris .
300
Their high acquaintances gradually dispersed
from hovering round, and Harriette , who recently
blazed like a comet in the hemisphere of love , became
as a falling star , without one single attraction
to mark what she had been. Apropos , it was
from this melancholy situation , unpitied and
scorned by her friends , that the Duke of Wellington
generously relieved her. He had known her
in better days, and discovered her while pacing
the Saloon of Drury-lane Theatre, shabbily
dressed and dejected in features and spirit. On
this occasion he spoke to her, and in fine began
the work of charity, in the hope of raising her by
a present of one hundred pounds, and continued
to do more, till she eventually got again into
high keeping, and repaid his kindness by making
him her ridicule before his face , and speaking ill
of him when his back was turned.
Her ingratitude to the Duke entitled her to the
reply he made to her late threat to write if he
did not send her money, viz. " write and be
d-d," though as an old friend of mine in this
neighbourhood pithily remarked- " Methinks ,
Mrs. Johnstone , she was d-d before she began
to write .'
301
To return to Fanny. The first decent keeping
she got into was with a man as famous for his
intemperance as for his great powers ; a most depraved,
and, at the same time , brilliant genuis.
One, whom as Pope says , was
" The wisest , brightest, meanest of mankind . "
This was George Cooke the tragedian ; a man
who had a kind heart under a rude exterior, and
did good to others whilst he was harming himself.
George had often taken her into the Harp,
and treated her with a supper and mulled port ,
and from habit got so partial to her, that he
generally sent for her when he was half seas
over, and she took especial care not to be out of
the way when wanted . At last, Cooke took her
a lodging in Marquis -court, Drury-lane , and
made that his home ; if he could be said to have
at home, whose days and nights were spent in
averns, except when actually engaged upon the
stage. Their tempers assimilated on most points .
they both drank and lived hard , and neither
valued the world's opinion a rush . This coucection
, for better and for worse, lasted nearly
2 c
302
L
two years ; but Fanny had a good voice , and
used to sing to amuse Cooke's friends at public
houses. One evening, when she had exerted her
talents in this humiliating way, the company expressed
their admiration so warmly , that her
keeper became jealous , and actually made an
attempt to cut out her tongue , and probably
would had he not been prevented by others more
sober. He, however , made a scar on her upper
lip and cheek , which diminished greatly the
small remains of beauty she had left,
The happy couple then parted, George promising
her a guinea per week, which he seldom
was able to pay, and she had recourse again to
the streets for support. I know little of her till
she got into keeping with the son of an alebrewer,
near Piccadilly , who left her on account
of her vices after which she experienced all the
vicissitudes of a street-walker's chequered existence
, About the time that her sister Harriette
was raised by the Duke of Wellington's bounty,
she was at her worst.
303
Harriette had no money to spare from her
own personal wants , so she applied to the present
Marquis of Hertford to get Fanny into an
hospital ; but he more humanely put her into
a lodging at Brompton, and ordered her to be
attended by his own family surgeon. But, alas !
it was too late for her to reap any benefit from
his charity ; her frame was a mass of disorders,
and her intellects deranged . Her passage to the
grave was made as easy as possible , and when
nature gave way to the power of death, Lord
Yarmouth ordered her to be decently buried
in Kensington Church-yard. These are all the
facts known to me of the last days of the once
admired Fanny Parker.
Reader, it becomes not me to moralize : it
might even seem like affectation in a person
whose character is so impugned. But for a
strong mind, and the interference of friends, my
last end might have been brought about before
now, and I should have gone out of the world as
reprobate as the offending Fanny.
304
In page 290 of vol. iii. Harriette has another
flagrant hit at me . These are her words :-
" As to Julia, she could not be prevailed upon
to leave her dear long-backed Mr. Napier for a
single day. Ladies on the wrong side of forty
become so very tender.”
I apprehend Harriette is a proof of the contrary,
" at the wrong side of forty she has
become very tough, to endure the hatred and
execration of mankind, and to court infamy with
the pen when her person was no longer desirable.
I very much question if Cornet Rochfort ever
experiences any of her tenderness , except when
a remittance arrives from Stockdale with encouragement
to write still another number, which
incites cutting up new characters , containing additional
lies. Such a communication would give
a zest to their petite souper ; and then over a
flask of Cognac, for a time, they are wont to
smile upon one another, at the folly of the world,
and the excess oftheir own wickedness .
Mr. Napier was a friend whom I could ill
afford to lose, and who received from me what
Harriette never had to give, namely, gratitude.
305
Harriette somewhere briefly remarks , that
her nephew, George Woodcock , accompanied her
to Paris : the fact is, he followed her thither ;
and if he had not done so , would have gone a
longer sea-voyage. In this way, her family were
all tainted with enormous vices , and yet she never
looks at home before she abuses others .
There may be some of my readers who may
think I have been too minute in several particulars
about this poor and wretched woman, but let
them reflect that the character of no one is seen
in its true light : By painting the dark and prominent
features that adorn or disfigure it , the
lighter appendages of drapery must be given, or
no lasting effect can be produced . The actor
who performs the striking part of a scene with
grandeur, must condescend to use a certain byeplay
to attain his object, or he will be scorned
as one of " Nature's journeymen," who " imitates
human nature abominably." The rake who
seeks to repair his ruined fortune by marriage ;
the careless , heartless, man of fashion, who addresses
the reigning beauty of the day, because
she is so called , and for the mere gratification
derived from the boast of possessing her ; and
2 c2
306
those who have experienced insult , neglect, or
barefaced infidelity or absolute desertion, may
find a lesson in my Confessions that may prove
serviceable to them in their troubles . If my
own errors are not to be overlooked , they
may be pronounced safely of such a description ,
that my virtues now could not have been exercised
without them, nor the public set on their
guard against treacherous lies .
I had almost formed an opinion, that Harriette
Wilson would have dropt scribbling with her last
very indifferent Number. I find she still persists
in treating the town with her scandal , and probably
will continue to do so as long as her friend
the Knight of " The Rueful Countenance" finds
the half- crowns coming in, though that is but
slowly, compared to what they formerly did when
the Wilson mania was at its height, and her
delusions believed by all. Now, however, the
disorder is considerably abated , she having exhausted
her store of characters , and relying
solely upon her own genius , inventive as it is ,
there is nothing in it to make a book. Indeed,
307
divest her book of original names, and substitute
fictitious ones in their room , and no one would
read it half through : it owes its chief interest to
the exalted characters and high sounding names
held up to public hatred, whether justly or not.
I have constant information of her intentions in a
way she neither can discover or can prevent.
Thus, I have perused the new volume which
her publisher has in the press , but which may
not appear for some time to come. Having no
occasion to wait for her, I shall proceed to remark
upon it , and also to give extracts, which
the reader may compare with the original hereafter,
and he will find I am correct in asserting,
that her " copy" is now before me on the table.
Mr. Stockdale may stare and turn up his whiteybrown
eyes to heaven, 'tis nevertheless most
true, that I have his work, and the world shall
know it , even though he never publish it.
Harriette has at length ceased to attack Julia
with her wonted asperity, and now treats her
very tenderly indeed ; but that shall not prevent
me from continuing to detect her falsehoods .
Stockdale and she are greatly mistaken if they
308
think by ceasing to blast my character, I shall
remain silent, while my friends are yet open to
their base calumnies .
Stockdale acknowledges, with bitterness of
heart, that " Julia's Confessions " had done the
Memoirs a great deal of harm ;" so that , in a
proportionate degree; I must have done good to
the public , and that to me is a delightful thought ,
amply compensating all the abuse I have received ,
and the trouble I have taken in pursuing the
fraudful guilty wretch to detection.
A great portion of her forthcoming book is
occupied with fulsome stuff concerning a certain
masquerade, altogether so insipidly narrated
as to be quite sickening - such as Berkeley
Craven and Mrs. Scott Waring , admiring her
feet and ancles . I do not know how she became
acquainted with that lady, who, it is well known,
was mistress to the late Duke of Hamilton , and,
of course, is not even since her marriage with the
wealthy old citizen, considered admissible into
every company, so that I can see nothing strange
in her and Harriette being acquainted .
She ridicules Lord Kinnard, and says , " it
309
gives me pleasure to assert , that I cannot help
thinking favourably of him , notwithstanding he
admired my sister Amy infinitely more than
me." A compliment from such a creature as
her I am sure will be laughed at by Lord Kinnard
, who to my certain knowledge never admired
any of her family. She also praises Mr.
William Lamb and his Italian dress , for the
purpose of sneering at Lady Caroline's vanity.
She next sustains an adventure with a man
"in a rich white satin Spanish dress, and a very
magnificent plume of ostrich feathers in his hat,"
who kisses her by force, and makes love like a
madman. Take for a sample this : " My dear
sweet, lovely Harriette, I implore your forgivenness
of a poor married wretch, who hates and
abhors the wife whom circumstances oblige him
to fear, -have been mad for you these five
years." Now, truly, this poor man need not
have been mad for five minutes , if he had presented
her with a twenty pound note, for that
was the settled rate at which she sold her
favours, until she became so reduced as to accept
any thing that was offered. She observes " when
310
he again insisted upon more kisses , I candidly
confess I never once dreamed of calling out rape
or murder." It would , indeed , have been similar
to the fable of the boy and the wolf, for no
one would have rendered her any assistance, or
believed her cries .
The whole of this ridiculous story is eked out,
merely that the reader may guess the mask to
have been Lord Ponsonby, who asks, " Tell me ,
did you not several times receive money sent to
you in a blank envelope, by the post ?" And in
another place-
" And my kisses-think you that you felt
them to-night, for the very first time in your
life ." After all this , say what she will , or insinuate
what she pleases, Lord Ponsonby never
sent her money, or even spoke to her after the
separation, as related by me in these Confessions ;
and, therefore, her story goes for nothing ; for,
what interest can the public take in a person disguised
and without a name, who chose to make
a fool of Harriette Wilson , and her vanity at a
masquerade ?
311
She thus describes her first meeting with
LORD BYRON.
"At last I found myself in the still great room
I have before described- it was entirely deserted
save by one solitary individual ; he was habited
in a dark-brown flowing robe, which was confined
round the waist by a leathern belt , and fell
in ample folds to the ground ; his head was uncovered
, and presented a fine model for the
painter's art. He was unmasked , and his bright
penetrating eyes seemed earnestly fixed-I could
not discover on what . His attitude was graceful
in the extreme, his whole countenance
so bright , serene , and beautiful , that I should
have been afraid to love him."
This is all fine enough, thought I, but any
body could write such stuff of Lord Byron, dead
or alive , and much better than Harriette Wilson.
A friend of mine, to whom I shewed this part of
her writing, and observed , " such an event might
have happened , as it is here described ," but how
was I surprised when he reminded me, that this
masquerade took place so far back as 1814 ,
when Lord Byron was on the continent . This
adds one more to her stock of imaginery tales ,
1
312
and it will be read with some interest as a poor
specimen of her art in book-making as modelled
by Rochefort and Stockdale.
There still is a possibility , that such an event
might have happened , and, therefore , I will not
deprive her of the chance that she might have
assigned a wrong date to this romantic adventure.
Yet is it strange how great souls know each
other, as if by ignoble instinct or supernatural
sympathy !
66
Though I do not know you, yet I guess that
you are on earth, and that there is nothing like
you. I could pity you for your fifty thousand
weaknesses and errors, and adore your talents
and *****
" Here is a high flight , interrupted the stranger,
I can now guess who you are ; but dare not name
the person I take you to be, lest I offend ; yet,
it is impossible it can be any body else. Why did
you affect not to know me ? Was it one ofmy
weaknesses you wanted to humour, by appearing
to guess me something out of the common
way. "
" Indeed I do not know you, and it has only
this instant struck me for the very first time, that
313
you must be Lord Byron, whom I have never
seen.'
99
" And you are Harriette Wilson. ”
We shook hands cordially.
" You are either Dean Swift or the devil,"
said some one formerly guessing at that eccentric
genius. Now what there could be in the minds
of a Byron and a Harriette, that they should
thus intuitively discover each other, is marvellous
indeed ! Vanity, vanity, all is vanity under
the sun.
Lady Caroline Lamb is once again introduced
into the picture , as follows :-
" I might excite your passions ; but then , such
contempt as you have lavished on poor Lady
Caroline Lamb would kill me."
"Is there any sort of comparison to be made
between you and that mad woman," Lord Byron
asked.
" No matter : I never would put myself in the
power of a man, who could speak thus of any
lady he had once professed to love."
" How do you know I ever did ?"
" Those letters in her ladyship's Novel of
Glenarvon are much in your own style , and
2 D
314
rather better than she could write : have you any
objection to tell me candidly whether they are
really your originals ?
" Yes, they are. But what of that- is it not
absurd to suppose that a woman who was not
quite a fool could believe in such ridiculous,
heartless nonsense ? Would not you have laughed
at such poetical stuff ?"
There is more of this kind of frank avowals ;
but here is quite sufficient for my purpose.
Whatever the faults of Lord Byron were, they
ought now to have been " buried with him," and
none will tax him with want of tenderness or
delicacy to the female sex. But is it to be
credited , that he would make such an avowal as
the preceding, and that to a common woman of
the town, whom he had never before seen , and
could only have heard of to her disadvantage !
The thing is too preposterous to be entertained
for a moment.
Admitting for the sake of remark , that his
Lordship and Lady Caroline had once been on
the footing of lovers , it was impossible he would
so far forget all honour and decency as to speak
of her thus contemptuously as a mad woman.
315
No, no, the world must totally forget what
Lord Byron was , before they can believe Harriette
Wilson on a subject where his honour ,
and every finer, manly feeling were concerned .
Besides, it is well known, that Lord Byron
thought her ladyship's talents respectable , and
advised her to amuse herself with poetry, and
as to Glenarvon , no one can pretend to say for
certain that it was she who wrote it.
Moreover, no one will believe that Lord Byron
would declare, that all Frenchwomen were his
aversion. He was a true citizen of the world,
and did not love or hate one nation more than
another. His memory cannot suffer by any
thing Harriette's vanity has tempted her to say
of it ;
and were he living, he would consider her
much too worthless even for contradiction ; as
he is no more, she is safe from his rebuke, though
not free from our execrations. Her interview
with his lordship ends as all her interviews with
the sex did, in kissing.
" Amuse toi, bien mon enfant, said Lord
Byron, drawing away his hand from my lips, to
give me an affectionate kiss."
And thus ended this romance of an hour.
316
At Paris she pretends that the Count d'Este
was in love with her, and her many amiabilities
so struck the Count's mistress , that she also
fell in love with her rival.
" Madame de Bostrum heard of my cruelty to
her lover, and almost went on her knees to induce
me to cut off a lock of my hair to present to the
Count d'Este."
" You are the most comical woman I ever met
with," said I.
" Are not my feelings natural ? I love the
Count d'Este, and , therefore , desire ardently, all
and every thing that can contribute to his happiness
. "
With respect to the Count d'Este, I care nothing,
and know little, only if Harriette and him
were on such warm terms at Paris , they cooled
amazingly in London , where I was introduced
to him ; for when he met Harriette and me in
St. James's Park, she advanced up to him very
familiarly, and addressed him in French. He
returned her forwardness by a distant bow, and
some common-place observation about the
weather . She blushed , and never afterwards
spoke of him to me.

### Page 317

She boasts of accommodating upwards of fifty people with a peep at the Sovereigns (who were then in London) from her box at the opera.

Now it so unfortunately happened, that we had given up our box long before that time, to save an expence we could ill afford. Besides, to her great mortification be it told, she was close confined to her chamber all the while they were in London, with Saint Anthony's fire in her face, or rather the fire of champaign, which, about this time she began to tipple very freely. Her and Beau Brummell, one evening, drank glass for glass, and wantonly emptied four bottles - so I refused any more.

The amiable Lady Anne Windham she espies at the opera,
"Leaning against the crimson door in her
most studied attitude, her swansdown tippet
thrown back to display her bosom , while the
same set soft smile she had worn for the last
twenty years , played upon her lips, and might
have played there unobserved till doomsday but
for her faithful , solitary swain , cicesbeo, or

### Page 318

lover, I know not which appellation he has best.
deserved, -My Lord Petersham , who was
eagerly making his way through the crowd, in
his outre costume d'Espagne, in order to pay his
respects to her ladyship . His address was most
correctly elegant ; his school that of Lord Chesterfield,
with less pedantry, or the late Duc de
Rochefoucault's, perhaps, without his depravity."
What does she know of these polite "gone - by's"
I should like to ask. She might as well have
talked of Absalom or Joseph, I apprehend.
Lady Anne Windham was allowed to be very
handsome , and slander has never tainted her
character. Lord ' Petersham, as I before stated,
was no favourite of Harriette's , and only now and
then spoke to her, because others ] of his acquaintance
did the same , and she was then
fashionable amongst the beaux .
She has omitted a circumstance which made
her a little notorious at Paris. She got introduced
to Sir Thomas Lavie, who had long been
a resident in France, in some official situation .
He was a kind-hearted good creature, as ever
lived. In early youth he and I were acquainted,
and her having mentioned me as her particular

### Page 319

friend, made him take a good deal of notice of her. She somehow or other induced him to accommodate her with four thousand francs, for which she gave an acknowledgment or promisory note, to pay when she heard from England.

Some weeks after Sir Thomas Lavie traced some reports injurious to his character up to her, and feeling justly indignant at this base return of his friendship, he demanded his money, for he knew also that she had got a supply at the time.

She accordingly called upon him, accompanied by one of her lovers, a gambler, called Count Mercier. Sir Thomas, while she was taking the cash from her reticule, laid down her promissory note, which she immediately seized and swallowed, and returned her notes into her reticule as quick as lightning. Calumny of the Newspapers refuted. That "misfortunes never come single," is an old and a true adage, which I have verified in my own person and character in several instances,

### Page 320

particularly since the publication of Harriette Wilson's Memoirs drew all eyes upon me; so that I scarcely can show myself abroad, but I hear the vociferated whispers of "that is Julia Johnstone; her who shines delectably in Harriette Wilson" --again, "Have you not read, my dear, in Harriette's Memoirs of Julia ----? Such annoyances would signify little to my future good name; for I expect to recover so much of it, by the candour of these "Confessions," that I hope to sit down quiet and content at the end of my days, so that my last friend and attendant may close the curtain upon the mortal remains of a repentant sinner, who retires from this world with the commisseration of mankind. But I feel as if compelled to notice them.

Meantime, however, my walks abroad are somewhat clouded by such sinister observations as those alluded to; but these being thrown out in a general way, and by persons who flit past us and are seen no more, were hitherto perfectly intangible; I could not possibly answer them, and to this moment have remained silent on this additional vexation. At length, however, an opportunity presented itself by which one of those

### Page 321

wholesale calumniators is brought fully under my notice, in such a manner, that I can refute his aspersions, and cast back in his teeth the imputations he would throw over my character.

Among my other misfortunes, immoralities, or crimes, I am not addicted to drink, was never disguised in liquor in my life; yet the Morning Herald newspaper says that I am, and "he lies with circumstance."

The course of my discovery was in this wise: passing into town afoot, near Tottenham-court turnpike, two dandies crossed my path, one of whom exclaimed "Julia again, by g-d; a pretty show up in the "Morning's at Bow-street." He added something about having "perused it - damned funny," and the like. At that moment I could not comprehend his meaning. I tried to guess: the "Morning's at Bow-street," thought I , “why this must be a book so titled! And am I then brought to make a figure at a police-office, where I certainly never did appear? Alas, the depravity of man!"

As I foreboded, so did the fact turn out. I sent to the library, and having borrowed the

### Page 322

book, I had to read but a short way when I came to the following passage at page 39. The reader may judge of the extreme palpitation of my heart when I read the first line: "Tipsy Julia."

"What demon dare accuse me of any thing so beastly as drunkenness?" I cried aloud.

At two or three efforts I got through the paragraph: it had appeared in the columns of the Morning Herald some three years before, I understood, and was now brought forward in this large volume, "on account of the celebrity of my name," as my informant was pleased to say. A moment's reflection taught me, that I could easily set the affair at rest, and obtain an apology from the author, to be inserted in the columns of the same paper, where the accusation had appeared originally. It ran as follows:

> [TIPSY JULIA](https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/3/5/7/8/35783/35783-h/35783-h.htm#Page_42).
> Miss Julia Johnstone was charged by a watchman
> with infesting his bate in a state of bastely
> drunkenness. "It was King-street, your honour,
> that same I am now spaking about," thundered

### Page 323

> "Did she abuse you?" asked his worship.

> "Fait, an she hadn't sense enough for that,

> feet; and, as she had nothing but tears to offer

> and disorderly, and ordered to find sureties for
> her better behaviour in future."

As soon as I could allay my feelings sufficiently, I sat down to dictate a letter to the person whose name the book bore; but by the way I may as well set down its full title, that the finger of scorn may in future be pointed to the works of an arrant caluminous liar, who having wounded a character, intentionally, deigns not to make

### Page 324

that reparation a candid avowal of simple error would alone afford:

"Mornings at Bow Street, a Selection of the most humorous and entertaining Reports, which have appeared in the Morning Herald. By J. Wright, Bow Street Reporter to the Morning Herald." What an enviable situation the fellow fills! viz. principal liar to the lying Herald!

To Mr. Wright, then, I wrote as follows:

> SIR,

No answer reached me. Day after day, I hunted the columns of the Morning Herald for the expected apology, but all my labour proving fruitless, I requested a male friend to apply personally for an explanation; and soon after he set out for Catherine Street, my letter came back per post opened, with "not to be found," written on the cover. On my friend's return I found that such an examination had taken place at Bow-Street, four years before; that the person there calling herself Julia Johnstone, was a shortish thick figure, with black hair, of vulgar manners, but really dressed in silk, as the paragraph described: that, immediately after the said examination, the woman was recognised by some

### Page 326

Irish people there present for a countrywoman, with a new name; and further, she acknowledged that she was a servant to a lady named Johnstone at Hampstead; but having obtained leave of absence from her mistress, had also borrowed some of her clothes to put on an appearance for the day. Scarcely had my informant closed this account of his enquiries, than I instantly recollected having had such a worthless hussey in my service about the time specified, who stole some clothes, and among them, exactly the sort of blue silk gown spoken of in Mr. Wright's flourishing Report. "Those reporters are the bane of society!" I exclaimed, when I found that he in question had heard the error in the name corrected as above, even before the ink was dry with which he noted down his tales. But he, it seems, thought the name of Julia Johnstone too good a joke to be passed over; and with a remorseless disregard for private feeling, permitted an obnoxious passage to remain unamended. Notwithstanding all this, does the same wretched person descend so far in the baseness

### Page 327

of his pursuit, as to quote passages from the pages of these very "Confessions" of mine, for the entertainment of his readers, and at the same moment calumniate the performance altogether, as one that is unworthy of perusal.

Indeed, Mr. Herald! Was it then requisite that a publication should be a rubbishing one, in your opinion at least, ere it could be considered worthy of furnishing matter for your columns?

Then is the Herald a heap of rubbish, even in the opinion of its own Editor. A pretty admission, truly; proving thy policy much weaker than thy Tom-foolery - sage Reporter! Whoever would attack Julia Johnstone with impunity, it is necessary, above all things, that he get up betimes-even before the Herald of the Morning proclaim his advent.

There is nothing more ridiculous than the efforts Harriette makes to convince the world that her amours were carried on for love, and that she despised money. She particularly wishes it to be believed, that her attachment to Meyler

### Page 328

was not for his cash, and that she bore with his diabolical disposition from mere pity.

Now if we look from the commencement of her career, it will be seen, that money was her very object - mammon her tutelary divinity, whose favours she squandered away most wantonly.

Surely Lord Ebrington would not sleep with her till three o'clock p. m. on a second day, without amply rewarding her for her condescension. She begs from every one - even her fine Monkish statue, her imaginary Lord Byron. She could not forge a letter as from him, or from herself without putting in a loan of money, so much did her fleecing system run in her head, as to expose and defeat her best laid schemes to deceive the public and much of a piece is her disinterested publisher, take this -

"Stockdale, in a courteous fit, acquainted the immortal Wellington, that I was about to publish a part of his private life."

Stockdale could not do this from kindness to the Duke, whom he has been abusing through a series of volumes, but only in the hope of getting "suppression money," and even this would not

### Page 329

have been mentioned had not I made the secret known, and that the Duke's reply was no threat of prosecution, but simply " write and be d―d ;"
and truly they have obeyed the rough injunction ,
for never were two scribblers more likely to be
d-d here and hereafter than Harriette and her
Rugantino, the Bravo of the Brothel .
And verily these Memoirs have been delayed,
owing to a considerable portion of them being
submitted to the Countess of Clare , who did not
think the scandal worth buying up . It is a pity
all who have been annoyed by attempts at extortion,
did not do as Mr. Ellis did , send the
letters to the newspapers. It was plain all she pretended
to have against Mr. Ellis's character were
fictions , for they have not dared to mention his
name again, and that transaction compelled her
Caliban to announce himself as solicitor-general
for " hush money," and so blew up the whole
scheme. The true cause of delay in the publication
of this closing volume is then, the waiting to
see who would be fool enough to buy up their
allotted shares , finding fresh supply of matter,
and fear, no doubt, of a prosecution from Wel-

lington and Frederick Lamb, operated in giving
The successful due caution. prosecution by
.
Blore, brought Harriette to Caliban's willa , and
many a weary evening was spent in reading,
erasing , and burning , before they dared venture
the finale to their operations before the eyes of
the public. With his usual egotism, and effrontery,
Stockdale has wound up the string
of conspiracies with an article wholly his own,
and therein he brings forward one Colonel Rochfort,
threatening " vulgar editors" with his vengeance-
his- the creatures- the wretch's vengeance.
I know not what to call him, but say
in the language of Lord Byron-
" And art thou then that abject thing
So nameless, yet alive ?"
A poor vulgar animal living on the proceeds
of prostitution, subsisting by the vilest means
that ever disgraced human nature, and he forsooth
to speak of " vulgar editors," and assume
a title in an honourable profession to which
he has no claim of any kind whatever .
Let me ask the creature if he recollects a
Cornet of his name , trying to raise some troops
for the South American service , dubbing himself

### Page 331

a Colonel much in the same manner Don Quixote
was dubbed a Knight by the innkeeper ; and
dressed as a gay Colonel, getting into debt for
accoutrements , which he received and sold, and
got into prison, and got out of it by means of the
assistance derived from a common strumpet to
whom he gave his name in return , for having
given him his liberty, upon terms an honest
chimney sweep would not have accepted . If his
memory does not serve him , he may apply to his
wife's looking glass .

Where men of any good reputation are concerned, the whole of Harriette's book is unworthy credit, but where such animals as Beau Brummell and Henry Brougham appear, with whose dirty tricks the world is familiar, we are bound to believe she sets down "nought in malice," for of such people the worst that can be said of them, is the plain and simple truth. I believe I mentioned before, her having consigned her papers to the care of a barrister, who would undertake the filthiest job for the sake of a fee.

She has now given that barrister a name, and in page 68, vol. iv. of Memoirs, she has Henry

### Page 332

Brougham, M.P. inviting her to dinner, and only her, leaving Amy out altogether. Well done, Harriette, not content with making the M.P. fond of harlot's society, but you must let us know you were a favoured one above all others.

She gives a fine account of Brougham "catching hold of the substance and pith of everything."

Now this may be all very true in as much as it concerns herself, but surely Mr. Brougham will not be well pleased to have the English whiggish world told, that when at Paris, he caught hold of substantial and pithy things to amuse the virtuous Harriette Wilson.

As Mr. Brougham once did a relation of mine the injustice to abuse her most grossly in court, where his object was to traduce every witnesses character to save a worthless client, I will waste a few words upon him, where he appears as the favoured swain of my heroine.

Mr. Brougham is not easy till he introduces this outcast of the English Stews to a respectable Peer of France. If he was respectable, how infamous must M.P. be to have imposed upon his notice this decayed and worthless creature; and

### Page 333

if he was disrespectable, and made acquainted with her real character, what a happy and chaste society must the Salon, of the British Senate have moved in at Paris.

She boasts in page 69 of seeing Mr. Brougham frequently, and he so far forgets himself as to become the champion of this common woman at a public dinner; and on her base word, which no Parisian that knew her would take upon any the most common occurrence, he launches out in abuse of the Duke of Beaufort, and advises her to employ himself to prosecute the Duke for her annuity.

What an honourable ambition in the Lord Rector of Glasgow, to aim at becoming an advocate for recovering the wages of prostitution. She relates a conversation passing betwixt her and Mr. Montague, and says with some naivette,

"It would be very easy for Montague to deny having uttered one word of the above. Luttrell, Amy, and Nugent were present, but Montague addressed me at the evening party in a low voice, they in all probability had something more pleasant to do than to listen to us.'

### Page 334

Pray what is the meaning of this? You, I dare say, reader, if acquainted with the town, would set it down, that every gentleman was engaged with his fille joye, and the fact of Montague's "speaking in a low tone of voice," appears as if they did not wish to distract each other in “those pleasant things they had to do." I remember reading in one of Cicero's letters, when he had fallen from the height of his fame, and was meanly trying to ingratiate himself with the young Roman nobleman previous to the arrival of Julius Cæsar. He describes a banquet, where a celebrated courtezan "laid down to supper with them." 

Pray, did Mr. Brougham, to ingratiate himself with the Nugents and Luttrells, introduce courtezans into his house, and will he have the assurance to justify this conduct by quoting that of the great Roman Lawyer, who as far as I have read was upon a par with him in point of sentimental delicacy towards the ladies?

Cicero (I have seen it in Mr. Pope's verses) made no scruple to lend his wife upon occasion to a friend; now I take it there is very little

### Page 335

difference betwixt the man's conduct who lends his wife to a friend, and his who takes a wife that has been borrowed by another person before, without the church sanctifying the loan.

And yet we have such indelicate instances on record of those who have obtained professional eminence and wealth, by continually canting and whining about moral virtue and domestic purity.

Harriette regrets the loss of Brougham's society. Oh, God! society! We shall have the felons of Newgate, when one of them is marched away to be executed, regretting the loss of his society.

What a mockery of decent language. His society was to her, she says, "a source of the highest gratification." I do not wish to be severe or put a forced construction on the lady's language, but she generally alludes to what she likes without any reserve, and when describing her extatic joys in company with Lord Ponsonby, she does it in the same words, and declares it to "have been a source of high gratification."

Certainly this bears a most lascivious interpretation, especially when follows, that he took leave of Paris and me nearly at the same moment;

### Page 336

"he could not bear to be in Paris one moment" after bidding La Belle Harriette adieu, and so dearly did he love her, that she was the last person he parted from. Bravo, again! say I, Harriette, if this does not answer your object, and make Mrs. Brougham jealous, then nothing earthly can accomplish it.

'Tis not unlikely, now, that "high gratifications" are gone by, Harriette wishes for a little of the Lord Rector's money, and just gives a gentle hint in her usual way. The only thing that could make me for a moment doubt the intimacy she so feelingly describes, is the certainty that a more complete antidote to the tender passion never walked upon two legs (Broom-sticks I mean) than Henry Brougham; his features apparently stamped on a toad-stool, and his eyes like marbles floating in´mortar; his chin and nose like the toes of Grimaldi's slipper, when dressed for Whang-fong, and the tout ensemble of his person so much like that of Sir Murray Maxwell's ouran outang, are sufficient to drive love to the devil, only to be out of sight of so horrible a caricature of human nature.

### Page 337

But then, Harriette could, and did submit to anything for the sake of money, and deformity of person was beauty to her eye when she was well paid; if Mr. Brougham did not give her his own money, he secured her 1200l. of the Duke of Beaufort's to which she had not the least title.

Let the Reader look on page 157 of Mitford's edition, vol. iv., and see how she speaks of her Adonis, for instance. "To say I look up to him, and love him is but a cold description of the sentiments he inspires in my heart." This is even more than Jonathan's love unto David, great indeed, and passing the love of women.

She says, moreover, that Brougham had money to send her, but he did not know her address, and adds, "you never refused me any assistance I asked for, nor any act of friendship in your power." Mighty pretty. What does Dame Grundy say to this? Could it be for nothing that a man, proverbially mean and shabby, who would sell his friend's letters for waste paper to gain a penny, would lavish his wealth on Harriette Wilson, if she had not inspired him with

### Page 338

sentiments like her own, and been to him "a source of the highest gratification."

I remember, my first friend, poor Cotton, used to tell me a case not unlike the one I am now so tenderly handling. "A brewer very eminent at that period had a sister, who made a faux pas, and produced sundry children who had no legal father. A poor north country barrister, who had done business for the firm, was induced from a consideration of eight or ten thousand pounds to undertake to do the lady's business for life, and married her, which was the means of introducing him to fortune and fame.

Though he helped the family afterwards in sending the father out of the world broken-hearted, and thereby adding more to his fortune; and he afterwards became intimate with a common girl, but which was not much noticed, from the circumstance of his wife not daring to complain, having been one of the same common description when he married her.

I am told Mr. Brougham has a wife, though I cannot say I ever saw her name in the Morning Post, as being at Court, or any mixed society of

### Page 339

respectability, where her husband is wont to appear. Some people have reasons for keeping their wives from public view, and some cannot force them into notice for particular reasons not to be told every day.

If Mrs. Brougham have not a fellow feeling for Harriette Wilson, from her loving the same ugly creature as herself, she will now shew her spirit if she has any, and, I confess, all mild as I am, and having a family of illegal children. Had I given my hand to a man legally, and he served me the tricks Mr. Brougham seems to have served his wife at Paris, and elsewhere, I would make every part of his body look as black and disgustful as his face does when on a crimson case, he is writhing under the lash of that superior lawyer, Mr. Scarlett, or when he is half choaked with spleen in the House of Commons, and snarling at my publisher, Benbow, for having plucked the borrowed feathers from the jackdaw, and shewed Henry Brougham Esq. M.P. as a broken stick, on which, whoever leans for support is sure to fall.

Mr. Brougham may now be sorry for having abused my poor relation as he did in court; for

### Page 340

that reason I have spoken more truth of him out of court than I otherwise would have done, seeing that his darling Harriette has by her praises reduced him to a level with her ownself, and the virtuous De Bouchet and Rochfort families.

Harriette's tales about her delicate Mr. Meyler having laid her a wager she could not bring Lord Ebrington to her bed, and she having done so,
and poor Meyler looking on, are all such improbable
and disgusting stories that none can believe,
and only the wretches in St. Giles's be entertained
with them . I gave the character of
Meyler before. I have no reason to alter it now.
Whether Lord Ebrington merits the titles of
" The handsomest, most sensible, and distinguished
looking young man in Europe," the
reader, if he has been long familiar with “ streetfaces,"
is the best judge . His lordship can make
a tolerable speech in the House, and has some
good personal qualifications and feeling qualities,
beyond these he merits neither censure or praise.
I have every reason to know , that Lord
Ebrington never had any dearer connection with
Miss Wilson in Paris than what any young man
might have with any woman "free as air, and

### Page 341

common as the idle wind." His lordship, who is distantly related to my family, once compounded a debt in my favour. I was obliged to him, because the act was one voluntary on his part, and he served me on the occasion. 

He said to me, "Your friend Harriette is a sad jade, she never tells truth. I paid ten thousand francs for her in Paris, and after my departure she told Meyler I never gave her a shilling." That his lordship was her dupe, I am aware, but he left her in time, and all the cash she had from him was lavished on Fenton, an Irish officer in the French service, who is now her avant courier, for he has twice preceded her voyages to England, and, I presume, bears the orders of the happy Cornet (Colonel) Rochfort, who is so well contented to be held up to the scorn and derision of mankind, that he actually now employs his agent, the Caliban of the Colonnade to announce his appearance upon the stage of public infamy. He will prove a profitable concern to John Joseph Stockdale, and a rival of the living Skeleton, though, I understand, his Harriette's Memoirs have placed

### Page 342

some flesh upon his bones. There is not any thing in these concluding essays of Harriette's demanding more severe reprehension. She has toiled on so many nights, and "caught no fish," that her and the Man of the disgustful countenance, are glad to draw in their nets, and submit to wallow breathless on the shore before they make another attempt.

Harriette's stuff about her nephew, George Woodcock, is really frivolous and sickening. The boy's true story sets all at rest; he was sent as midshipman on board of ship of war, and sailed for the East Indies. He plundered his masters, the lieutenants, and was expelled the service. He died on board a pirate vessel, near the Gallepago Islands, in defending her, for had he been taken alive, he would have been hanged. So much for George, who scorned to speak French, and only blabbed a word when indecency roused him to gratify the filthy brutish feelings of his hackneyed old aunt and instructor.

Her humbug about her family is equally sickening. Meyler furnished seventy pounds to
### Page 343
bring them over to Paris - Lord Berwick one hundred, and they were all disposed of in a manner not worth mentioning. Suffice it, for two months previous to her dissolution, Mrs. De Bouchet used to parade the Boulevards, in the month of July, clad in a riding habit, and with a narrowbrimmed beaver, hanging gently over her bloodshot eyes. She was never sober, and literally died of "Two pints of brandy and a great chair diem." A strange disorder but a true one; and almost a natural death for all the De Bouchets. The fruit-sellers are wags, and having traced her home, christened her "Madame de Vilsoni, Rose de Angletere" - that is "the Rose of Old England." An Irishman said, "her nose may have been the Rose of Old England, but it is cursedly withered, and fifty-five years have given it the complexion of an Irish red cabbage in my eye."

Her account of Madame de Bostrum is all fudge; and her tale of Lord Alvanley, Worcester, and Brummell, raising thirty thousand pounds, which they never meant to pay, I pronounce at once an abominable falsehood. At the time she

### Page 344

has chosen for her "exposure," Lord Alvanley was in embarrassed circumstances, and so was Worcester. Brummell was never well off, but he had always carried the appearance of outward sufficiency. The sum raised was only three thousand pounds, and securities were given for its payment. Brummell proved of no use, but Lord Alvanley very soon repaid the whole sum; and be it recorded to his honour, that since his late accession of property, he has paid all his debts to the amount of 55,000l. with interest. I wish we had a few noblemen of a similar character.

Brummell's emigration took place upon his having lost five thousand at the Hell of Gordon, in Jermyn-street. A subscription was entered into to enable him to quit the country, and he went to Calais, where he still remains, but I very much doubt whether he should be anathemized for "slinking" those debts of honour which are founded on villainous principles.

Harriette in her paucity of amusement, relates a story of a coachman, who drove her barouche. Mark me, reader, her barouche. He reined up

### Page 345

his steeds , and she announces it with all the
pomp of Pindar :-
" On Thracias hills the lord of war
Hath curbed the fury of his car.”
But
" It seemed on Gallia's arid plains
The coachman breath'd his little veins . "
For Harriette delights to dwell with minuteness
upon the scene. Take it in her own words.
" What is the matter ?" I asked .
"6
Rien," answered Rosabella, " ce'st quil veut
p- f-g. This explantion was soon made unnecessary
by the exhibition Francois made in our
full view, standing at the head of the horses."
She then, after some desultory matter, observes
:-" Francois , necessity was of such long
duration ; we had full time to discuss the manner
of its indulgence."
She tells her story of the French postillion ,
as if she had seen it from her barouche . We
all know the covering of a barouche descends
in ample folds behind and before , and she could
346
Hot see over it , unless standing , or peeping over
the door-passage . So that the indelicacy of the
thing (if it ever occurred) was all on her side.
Now I have no other intention in stating this
disgusting case, than to shew that she has told
a deliberate lie in two instances. Now, reader ,
the tale of Harriette's coachman's stoppage can
be found in the Second Volume of Tristram
Shandy, where the Duchess de Rambouillet
pulls the check string, and Yorick asks her " for
what reason." "Rieu que passur," exclaimed
the Marchioness , who tript out of the chaise and
returned again like a water nymph. In the language
of Sterne this " tells well ," but Harriette has
vulgarised it in every part ; and surely, she , her
Caliban, and her Cornuto , must be all fools together,
to suppose for one instant such a gross
plagiarism could escape the eye. I will give
her credit for a most daring attempt ; and if her
Night Vision cannot be found in the Fourth
Volume of the " Spectator," and in the Third
Number of the " Idler," I will say I am not to
be depended upon any more.
I feel much indebted to Harriette for having
.
347
" killed me off," as Mr. Wyndham used to say.
She has dismissed me very unceremoniously
indeed , and as she had derived the greatest interest
in her Memoirs, from the mention of my
name , I am sorry she should compel me to read
the record of my own inhumation .
Harriette disposes of her sister Fanny in true
theatrical style . It is odd that she should try
to impress upon the public mind Fanny's death ,
as springing from her remembrance of her old
protector , when Fanny had , since that , had been.
under the protection of nine others One of them,
Jew Wilna, who escaped hanging for forgery,
merely because Lord Yarmouth likened him to a
foreign dog in a strange country, who knew not
why he ran his head into a halter.
Napier, once Fanny's friend , is now, I believe,
Inpector-General of the Ionian Islands, and has
published a work, with drawings of his own . It
is well written , so says my friends , the critics ,
and implies that he did not deserve the character
Miss Wilson has given to him .
The unfeeling manner in which Harriette
Wilson attempts to crucify the Duke of Welling348
ton, tells volumes against her , and I cannot suppose
why it is , she for ever lies.
At the commencement of this work, I promised
some specimens of her poetic talent, and I am
most afraid I cannot fully redeem my pledge,
for she could only rhyme . However, to satisfy
in some measure, my readers , I subjoin an " Impromptu,"
said to be uttured by her as she
rushed into Caliban's arms , when she skulked
over from the continent.
" Here am I come o'er the main ,
Tag, rag, and bobtail ;
To work at Cut and come again , "
With John JOSEPH Stockdale . "
Certainly there is cut and come again , with a
vengeance in the countenance of the Caliban of
Colonnade, and I cannot account for the penchant
between these twain better than by the
old saying,
66
Hungry dogs love dirty pudding. ”
I hate indecency of any kind, and so does every
honest woman. Harriette says , " Ebrington
and I were excellent companions - we seldom rose
till three or four in the day. " This shameless
349
avowal is quite horrific, and no other woman
than a Harriette Wilson could have said it.
I profess to know not any thing of the story she
relates about Cecile , it is too bad for any one
even in the lowest society. If the child was really
so bad as she represents, then she must be worse
than I ever supposed her, to listen to such
youthful depravity and not try to discourage it.
There is an old and a true saying, “ Once a
jail-bird always a jail-bird." Harriette entertains
her readers with an Old Bailey story, which
is ten times better told by any common reporter.
She seems surprised that the eminent
counsel, Mr. Andrews, " stared at her with persevering
effrontery ." Might not the learned
gentleman do so, from remarking the assurance
with which such a famous demirep had the effrontery
to place herself forward to justify a
felon. And does Harriette remember when she
was had up to a police-office, for mislaying the
diamond snuff-box of a son of the Marquis
of Conyngham, and the gentleman employed
against her. He saved her from Botany Bay.
His words she cannot have forgotton. That her
2 G
350
friends may remember them, I will repeat them.
66
She, the culprit, is apparently not versed in crime
she is yet young. I have no authority for what
I am going to propose, but I believe on honour
it will be acceptable to my client. That is to
consider her as a child, and then let her go ."
She was admonished and discharged upon
this occasion , but convey an obligation to a
degenerate mind , and you make it your enemy
for ever. Thus Harriette returns bad for good ,
though as this counsel is yet living and able to
bring her to justice, she is silent ; but on Lord
Mount Charles she is very severe .
Now, reader , this is really and truly one of
the most rascally attempts she ever made to
villify the living and the dead . Lord Mount
Charles is dead, or she would not have slandered
him. He went from London in the Active frigate,
44 guns, and never stopped till he anchored in
the Road of Leghorn , February 20 1825. From
thence he proceeded to Rome , where he died .
As he never was within one thousand miles of
Paris , and at the time she complains of her letters
being refused, he could not by any possibility
351
know Harriette, a woman he would have dispised.
But it suited her and Rugantino to abuse the
passage of the British mails , to and from France .
They dared not fix upon the present efficient
officers , but they fix upon one
one, who
never interfered actively in the duties of his
office , and who was famed for gentleness of disposition
, which if it
" Met a worm even in the public path
Would step aside , and bid the reptile live . "
There were few men of so amiable manners
as Lord Mount Charles . The king dearly
loved him , and made him go to Italy, where he
found a grave. He does well now for her friend
Caliban and Co .; he cannot speak, and slander
would triumph over the tomb but for Julia.
Harriette has well got up a tale of the death
of Fanny. In fact, the death-bed of Fanny was
dreadful . She screamed to live , and had no
hopes of a blessed hereafter. I fear it may
prove a family death -bed . For the work my
friend Harriette has produced , I give her credit
352
for all the ingenuity due to a woman versed in
intrigue. The licentious and gay parts she has undoubtedly
written , the brutish parts are Stockdale's
all over ; and the sentimental parts are the
sapient husbands-the broken down soldier, that
something less than Veluti, who warms himself
in imbecility, and feeds the decaying fire of sensuality
as well as he is able.
Miss Wilson finishes her Memoirs with an account
of her tender attentions at her sister's
dying bed. I happen to know that all she says
is untrue. When Fanny died , Harriette was at
Paris, and the place and manner of her death
can be more truly found by enquiry at a certain
place not far from Hyde Park Corner. I do not
Lock secrets in my breast as M.D's do in
Hospital transactions, but even Miss Wilson may
find , like her accomplished sister, a Lockup
house is no bad thing to resort to during the
last moments of a courtezan's life.
Very possible some of Harriette Wilson's
readers will pause upon that part of her narration,
where she writes thus:
I cannot quote it-' tis too horrible.
page 158 of Mitford's Edition.
-But , no-
Look at
Great God !
353
"
and can this wretch call herself a woman-a
woman ! one formed in nature's common mould
with myself, and one to know, that such things
as she alludes to , are not to be found within the
the calendars of man , nor can all her art make
human nature bend to the contemplation of such
horrid depravity with common patience.
Having thus traced Miss Harriette Wilson
down to her lowest level , and accompanied her
in her highest soarings, I can now bid her
farewell with some confidence. I have not , I am
sure, done more to her wanderings than they
merit. I have rescued many from her dark
imputations , and made the wheels of domestic
life only available to the touch of prudence, good
humour, and virtue .
It was never my intention to do more than
what I have now accomplished ; to check the
stream of injustice, and place truth by the side
of fallacy , so that the reflection of one might obscure
the other. I have chosen no dignified
station- I have been no rival demirep of Harriette's,
but attended her as the fabled pilot star
does the comet, until it
" Curbs its red yoke and mingles with the sun . "
G 2
354
I have experienced the gratitude of many, by
their letters left at my publishers , but I beg
leave to answer them one and all. To me no
thanks are due . I have pursued my course, in
order to acquit my conscience of a heavy debt,
on the score of religion and morality . I say
with St. Paul " I have fought the good fight-
I have finished my course," and now I care not
what man can say against me.
In the happy consciousness that I have been
the means of stemming, in some degree, the torrent
of depravity, the Memoirs of a cabal were
pouring upon civilized nature. I rest satisfied,
and those who peruse both works will find , I
trust, their astonishment aroused by the avowals
of a Harriette Wilson, and their mercy and
justice well exercised upon the CONFESSIONS OF
JULIA JOHNSTONE .
