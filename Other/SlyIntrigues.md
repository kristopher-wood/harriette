**ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1825**, a folded letter was dispatched from Paris to London, postage paid in advance, arriving a few days later. At that time letters were casually addressed, but post-office clerks were as knowledgeable then as London taxi drivers are today. They had no difficulty in identifying the intended recipient. What the clerks may not have known was that the sender and her husband were currently causing panic at the highest government levels in London and Paris. The two governments were in secret contact over their concerns, and the couple's home in the French capital was raided and ransacked by the authorities in the same month that this letter was written.

The letter is addressed to "Adolphus Esqr Pleader London" and intended for the prominent barrister John Adolphus. In 1820 he had defended five of the Cato Street conspirators who plotted to murder all the members of the cabinet, and in 1821 represented the Life Guards who had killed two demonstrators at the hugely disrupted funeral procession of Queen Caroline. The latter role earned him an appearance in a caricature by George Cruikshank ("The Horse-Councellor"), as a centaur-lawyer who has taken the brief marked "Jew v. Jury". But Adolphus (1768-1845) was very much an assimilated Jew. His Jewish father had married out, to the displeasure of his family, and Adolphus in turn married an Anglican clergyman's daughter. In his edited diaries and memoirs, published in 1871, the reader will find no discussion of a fascinating family background, and at one point he writes of a "very low Jew attorney, Barney Hart".

The letter Adolphus received in 1825 was an extortion letter, one of maybe 200 sent out by the courtesan Harriette Wilson (1786-1845) in the mid-1820s, as she wrote and published in instalments, then as books, the _Memoirs_ that secured her prominent place in histories of Regency England. Her client list was a _Who's Who_ of the great and not so good, headed by the Prince Regent, now misruling as George IV. The serial publication of Wilson's best-selling _Memoirs_ was reckoned a catastrophe by the governing class and occasioned the flurry of diplomatic activity in France in 1825, aimed at suppressing further revelations, especially any relating to the king and his close circle. It made matters worse that the memoirs were not only scurrilous, but also enlivened by splendidly accomplished comic passages.
  
Adolphus had combined a stellar legal career with historical research and public engagement. He was politically a Tory who, in 1799, published lengthy biographical sketches of those who made and those who suffered from the French Revolution, and was savvy enough to be paid handsomely for political services when Addington was prime minister (1801-04). But the diaries and memoirs show someone whose experience of life was much more varied and colourful than this public persona might suggest. In 1783, as an unhappy boy of fifteen, he was sent to work in St Kitts, where his great-uncle Michael Adolphus had family business interests, and where he watched slave ships being unloaded. Returning to England to train as an attorney, Adolphus became well acquainted with London's other world of gambling dens, unruly clubs and theatre life. In 1816, by then a member of the Inns of Court, he challenged a fellow bencher to a duel, fought with pistols in Calais. Adolphus was unhurt; his opponent survived the bullet that lodged in his arm.

In the extortion letters Wilson offered her former protectors and amours the chance to buy

themselves out of the _Memoirs_ before the next instalment was printed, either with a lump sum or an annuity. Many clearly did so and burnt their letters; others hesitated or quibbled until it was too late. Names were added or removed minutes before the pages went to press. Some called her bluff. The Duke of Wellington is famously supposed to have scrawled across his letter "Write and be damned" (in the version first told by Wilson's rival Julia Johnstone), then returned it. He duly appears in the _Memoirs_ as a laughable character, compared to a rat-catcher. The MP Edward Ellice (who gave his name to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands) promptly passed his letter to the press, where it was published in full, and at least one other recipient did likewise. Ellice does not appear in the _Memoirs_.

Few of these letters appear to have physically survived; in her biography of Harriette Wilson, _The Courtesan's Revenge_ (2003), Frances Wilson quotes from just two correspondences, both in institutional holdings. This newly rediscovered letter to Adolphus presents its threat without preliminaries: Wilson is in possession of compromising letters to a "handsome young man" seduced by a niece, who then sought means "to destroy the infant in her bosom". In past English usage a "niece" was not necessarily the child of a sibling, and the "handsome young man" might never have met Wilson. Adolphus was fifty-seven in 1825, but an affair might have dated back to his youth. The person alluded to could instead have been his son, John Leycester Adolphus, also a barrister, who had married in 1822 and was now thirty years old. He is remembered as the person who, in 1821, first identified Sir Walter Scott as the author of _Waverley_. Whoever is being implicated, Wilson is confident she will be understood. She tells Adolphus that he and his "low family" are in danger.

The letter makes assumptions that suggest a more than passing acquaintance with Adolphus. He will know Henry Brougham, and of Brougham's association with Wilson. Lord Brougham was perhaps the most longstanding and loyal of Wilson's friends, right up to her death in 1845, when he solicited and contributed to the funds needed for her funeral. Frances Wilson comments: "Brougham appears moved by Harriette's death, and alone of her lovers may have mourned her". He was also one of those who paid up to be written out of the _Memoirs_, compromised by the fact that he had continued his liaison with Wilson after his marriage. But as significant as those indicators of familiarity is the knowing passage that reads: "but veryly friend Adolphus we are none of us perfect have all our little sly intrigues either in the neighbourhood of the new Road [Euston Road] or else where". That is very much in the style of Harriette Wilson, and suggests intimacy rather than desperate scratching around for dirt.

The letter surfaced in 1863 at Sotheby & Wilkinson's auction of "The Valuable Library of the late John Leycester Adolphus". (He died in 1862). Among the lots is listed "a characteristic letter of Harriette Wilson to John Adolphus", which sold for six guineas, a considerable sum for a letter from the recent past and assumed by the describer to require no further elucidation than the word "characteristic". Since both John Leycester's wife and Adolphus Sr's literary-minded daughter Emily were alive in 1863, it seems odd that such a letter was allowed to go to auction - and as a single lot item. But it could have been bought by a member of the family. The letter then disappeared until 2023, when it turned up, unidentified, in a mixed lot of old letters sold at an English provincial auction. As far as it has been possible to determine it is published here, in full, for the first time.

The letter's authenticity is readily confirmed by the identical handwriting of another letter, sent by Wilson to Brougham from Calais in 1828 and illustrated in Kenneth Bourne's The Blackmailing of the Chancellor (1975). Wilson's letter lends itself to fairly ready transcription, apart from a bit of crossing out and one word in doubt from damage occasioned when the letter seal was broken. Her first name does look like "Honriette" - a phonetic spelling - but it could be "Henriette" or even "Harriette". Rochfort was her married name (and Wilson a professional one: she was born Harriette Dubouchet). The term "blackmail" did not come into use until the 1840s, and at the time they were written the letters were referred to in the press as extortion letters.

      applied to him for means to destroy the infant in
      her bosom useless to deny this or cry "fie" for I have
      the letters in my possession - as well be quiet and
      oblige a lady you are growing rich I have spent all
      my money in furnishing my home and paying my
      debts will you do an act of Gallantry and send me
      100£? If you do I shall not be ungrateful - or you
      may publish this letter like Edward Ellice but veryly
      friend Adolphus we are none of us perfect have all
      our little sly intrigues either in the neighbourhood
      of the new Road or elsewhere and I might say to
      you in the words of Don Quixote to Sancho - "veryly
      friend Sancho the more thou stireth it the more
      it will stink - once more will you be my favourite
      and a noble man[?] of Gallantry - if so forward me
      100£ trust to my gratitude - Brougham I am sure
      would say you might do so safely, - & sign yourself
      The Dauphin for fun - but you must be quick
      about it because you are witty [?] 
      Yours truly [?]
