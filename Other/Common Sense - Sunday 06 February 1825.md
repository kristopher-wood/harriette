**NOTICE TO CORRESPONDENTS**

**Morality** --- has been received and read, Hypocrisy would have been a more appropriate signature. The public is so satiated with the subject, and so disgusted with the trash of the old Times, that Mr. Morality must excuse our want of courtesy in not inserting his letter in our column, we have, however, inserted it in a fitter place --- *the fire*.

Our Preston correspondent is informed that we have not forgot *Stoney-hurst* school --- nor are we unmindful of the proceedings of the contemptible little Catholic delegate, to which he has thought it necessary to re-call our attention. These persons and things will be *properly* noticed at the proper time.

**Criticus** --- is wrong the book to which he alludes is not the production of the ***Nobleman*** he names, but of a person assuming the appellation of *Miss Harriett Wilson*, the late *Miss Wilson*, who would wish every body to understand that she is no longer *Miss Harriett Wilson*, but the lawful and **TRUE** wife of a gallant Colonel now in Paris. An Aide-de-Camp of His Serene Highness the Cazique of Poyais, and most probably carrying with him the title of Duke with some other trinkets, with which His Highness has been so profuse among his Mosquito territory.

**Review of Harriette Wilson’s *Memoirs***

… work of a novel and extraordinary, and to some tastes, no
… of an entertaining character, and which, we understand, 
… rapidly acquiring a most extensive circulation, has been 
… to us; and we have perused it with a variety of emo- 
… one of which has, however, predominated over all the 
… mean that of disgust. It is entitled “Memoirs of *Harriette Wilson*,” and purports to be written by the fair heroine herself, whose adventures it narrates; and who, if we were to credit the description which she has given of her attractions, we must conclude to have been extremely beautiful. We happen, however, some years ago, to have seen this dauntless heroine, whose *maiden name*, we believe, to have been *Harriette de Bouchee.* —-- There is a considerable quaintness of style in the production of this female, particularly in her description of the characters and conduct of *The Duke of Wellington*, *Lord Craven,* and *Lord Alvanley*, which we shall insert in our next, with observations on the work itself, which want of room now prevents us.

## MEMOIRS OF HARIETTE WILSON AND OTHERS.

A Bookseller in the Arcade, Pall Mall-we believe a Member of the Soclety for the Suppression of Vice, but certainly a great strickler fer Church and State --- is now publishing a work in numbers under the above title, which has excited an extraordinary sensation in the *beau monde*. The lady is, or was a courtezan, and professes to write, not only the memoirs of berself, hut of others, including those of her three sisters, who it would seem had chosen a similar frank and professional line of conduct.  What renders the work most remarkable is, the circumstance of the open mention of the cavaliers who had the felicity of her ladyship's ac-quaintance.  It is written with sprightlines, and as it affords a peep behind the Curtain of "Life in London," we shall give a few extracts. The lady commences as follows:---

"I shall not say why and how I became, at the age of fifteen, the mistress of the Earl of Craven. Whether it was love, or the severity of my father, the depravity of my own heart, or the winning arts of the noble lord, which induced me to leave my paternal roof, and place myself under his protection, does not now much signify; or if it does, I am not in the humour to gratify curiosity, in this matter.

I resided on the Marine Parade, at Brighton, and I remember that Lord Craven used to draw cocoa trees, and his fellows, as he called them, on the best vellum paper, for my and here, my amusement. Here stood the enemy, he would say, and here, my love, are my fellows. There the cocoa trees, &c. It was, in fact, a dead bore.

All these cocoa trees and fellows, at past eleven o'clock at night, could have no peculiar interest for a child like myself, so lately in the habit of retiring early to rest. One night, I recoliect, I fell asleep; and as I often dream, I said, yawning, and half awake, Oh Lord! oh Lord! Craven has got me into tue West Indies again.

In short, I soon found that I had made but a bad speculation, by going from my father to Lord Craven. I was even more afraid of the latter, than I had been ef the former. Not that there was any particular harm in the man, beyond his cocoa trees; but we never suited nor understood each other. I was not depraved enough to determine immediately on a new choice, and yet I often thought about it.


How, indeed, could I do otherwise, when the Hon. Frederick Lamb was my constant visitor, and talked to me of nothing else? However, in justice to myself, must declare, that the idea of the possibility of deceiving Lord Craven while l was under his roof, never once entered into my head. Frederick was then very handsome, and certainly tried, with all his soul, and with all his strengtb, to convince me that constancy to Lord Craven was the greatest nonsense in the world.
I firmly believe that Frederick Lamb sincerely loved me, and deeply regretted that he had no fortune to invite me to share with him.
Lord Melburne, his father, was a good man.
Not one of
your stiff-laced, moralizing fathers, who preach chastity and forbearance to their children. Quite the contrary, he congratulated
a ine girl with him.
his son on the lucky circumstance of his friend Craven bavinE ambs,
No such thing, answered Frederick
I am unsuccessful there. Harriette will bave nothing to do with
me。
Nonsense! rejoined Melburne, in great surprise, I never
heard any thing halt so ridiculous, in all my life.
The girl must
be mad. She looks mad.
I thought so the other day, when I
met her galloping about, with her feathers blowing, and her thick dark bair ahout her ears. I'l speak to Harriette for you, added his Lordship, after a long pause, and then continued repeating to hemself, in an under tene, Nothave my son, indeed! six feet high! a fine, straight, handsome, noble, young fellow! I wonder what she would have,-In truth, I scarcely knew myself; but something I determined on: so miserably tired was I of Craven, ane his cocoa trees, and his sailing boats, and his ugly cotton night-cap.
Surely, I would say, all men do not wear those shocking cot ton night caps: else all women's illusions had been destroved on
the first night of their marriage. I wonder, thought , what sort of a night-cap the Prince of Wales wears?
Then I went on to
wonder, whether the Prince of Wales would think me so beautiful as Frederick Lamb dis? Next, I reflected, that Frederick Lamb was younger than the Prince; but then again, a Prince of Wales!!! Tnus musing, I listlessly turned over my writing book haif in the humour to address the Prince of Wales! A sheet of paper, covered with Lord Craven's cocoa trees, decided me, and l wrote the fo
letter, which I addressed to the Prince:-
* Brighton.
" I am told I am very beautiful, so perhaps you would like to see me;
and I wish that, since so many are disposed to love me, one, for in the hu-mihty of my beart I should be quite satistied with one, would be at the pains to make me love him.
In the mean time, this is all very dull work,
Sir, and worse even than being athome with my father; so, if you pity me, and b-lieve you could make me inlove with you, write to me, and direct to the Post Othee hete.
* By return of post, I received an answer nearly to this effect, A believe fram Colonel T'hontas: -
" Miss Wilson'e letter has heen received by the noble individusi to whom it was addressed.
It Miss Wilson will como to town, sue may have an in-
terview, by directing her letter as before.
"I answered this note directly, addressing my letter to the Prince of Wales:-
" Sir,-To travel ftty-two miles this bad weather, merely to see a man, with only the given number of lege, arms, fingers, dcc., would, you must ad-mit, be madness, in a girl like mysell, surrounded by humble admirers, who are ever ready to travel any distance for the honour of kissing the tip of her hitle finger; but, i you chu prove to me that you are one bit better than any man, who way be ready to attend my bidding, l'il e'en start for Leadon directly.
So I you can do any thing better, in the way of pleasing a lady,
than ordinary meu, write directly: if not, adieu, Monsieur le Priuce,
"I won't asy Your's,
" By day or night, or any kind of light;
" because you are too impudent.
" It was necessary to put this letter into the post-office myself, as Lord Craven's black footman would have been somewhat surprised at its address. Crossing the Steyne, I met Lord Melburne, whu jowed me immediately. Where is Craven? said his Lord-ship, shaking hands with me.
Attending to his military duties at
Lewes, my Lord. And where's my son Fred? asked his Lord. ship. I am not your son's keeper, my Lord, said I. No; by the by, enquired his Lordship, how is this? I wanted to call upon you about it.

-Why, said Lord Melburne, did you not turn the pour boy out of your house as soon as it was dark, although Craven was in tawi, and there was not the shadow of an excuse for such treatment?-At thi- moment, and before I could recover from my surprise at the tenderness of some parents, Frederick Lamb, who was almost my shadow, jo.ned us. Fred, my boy, said Lord Melburne, I'll

...Ladies scorn dates! Dates make ladies nervous and stories dry.

...Thus, after having gone through all the routine of sighs, vows, and rural walks, he, at last, saw the blooming and safe in his dismal chateau, in Argyle-street."


The next day she informed Fred. Lamb of what had bappen-ed, and he quitted her in madness and fury.-She immediately changed her lodgings for a furnished house at the west end of the town, and the only alloy to her happiness is the attentions of the Duke to an old flame, Lady W.

Harriette now mentions her sisters, for the first time, in the following terms:—--

"The next morning, I was greatly surprised by a visit from my dear lively sister
Fanny, ou her arrival from the country.

Fanny was the most popular woman I ever met with. The most ill-natured and spiteful of her sex, could never find it in their hearts to abuse one, who, in their absence, warmly fought all their battles, whenever any body complained of them where she was. 

I often asked her why she defended, in society, certain unamiable persons?

Merely because they are not here to defend theaselves, and, therefore, it is two to one against them, said Fanny. --- Fanny, as the Marquess of Hertford uniformly insisted, was the most beautifal of all our family. He was very desirous of having her portrait painted by Lawrence, to place it in his own apartment. That laughing dark blue eye of hers, he would say, is unusually beautiful.

His Lordship, by the bye, whatever people may say of the coldness of his heart, entertained a real friendship for poor Fanny; and proved it, by every kind attention to her during her last illness.

He was the only man she admitted into her room, to take leave of her, before she died, although hundreds, and those of the first rank and character, were sincerely desirous of doing so. I remember Lord Yarmouth's last visit to Brompton, where my poor sister died afer an illness of three weeks. Can I, or my cook, do anything in the world to be useful to her? said he.
I repeated that it was all too late - that she would rever desire any thing more, and all I wanted for her, was plenty of Eau de Cologne, to wash her temples with; that being al she asked for. He did not send his groom for it; but galloped to town himself & was back immediately.

This was something, for Lord Yarmouth; but to proceed, Fanny was certainly very beautiful, she had led a most retired, steady life, for seven years, and was the mother of three children, at the death of their father, Mr. Woodcock, to whom Fanny would hive been married, could he have obtained a divorce from his wife. Every body was mad for Fanny, and so they had been during Mr. Woodcock's life; but it was all in vain. Now there was a better chance for them perhaps.

Fanny, and our new acquaintance, Julia, soon became sworn friends. Most people believed that we were three sisters Many called us the Three Graces. It was a pity that there were only three Graces! and that that is the reason, I suppose, why my eldest sister, Amy, was cut out of this ring, and often surnamed---one of the Furies.

She was a fine dark woman too. Why she hated me all her life I cannot conceive; nor why she invariably tried to injure me, in the opinion of all those who liked me, I know not; but I can easily divine why she made love to my favourites; for they were the handsomest she could find.

It was Amy, my eldest sister, who had been the first to set us a bad example.  We were all virtuous girls, when Amy one fine afternoon, left her father's house, and sallied forth, like Don Quixote, in the quest of adventures.  The first person who addressed her, was one Mr, Trench; a certain short sighted, pedantic man, whom most people know about town. I believe she told him that she was running away from her father.

All I know for certain is, that when Fanny and I discovered her abode, we went to visit her, and when we asked her what, on earth, had induced her to throw her self away, on an entire stranger, whom she had never seen before? her answer was, I refused him the whole the first day; had I done so the second he would have been in a fever. Amy was really very funny, however spitefully disposed towards me.

To be brief with her history. Trench put her to school again, from motives of virtue and economy. From that school she eloped with General Maddan. Amy's virtue was something like the nine lives of a cat.  With General Maddan she, for several years, professed constancy.

Indeed I am not quite certain that she was otherwise. I never, in my occasional visits, saw anything suspicious, except once, a pair of breeches!! It was one day when I went to call on her, with my brother. General Maddan was not in town. She wanted to go to the Opera.

The fit had only just seized her, ar past nine o'clock. She begged me to make her brother's excuse at home, as, she said, he must accompany her. What, in those dirty boots? I asked.  I have got both dress-stockings and breeches, upstairs, of Maddan's replied Amy; and I assisted at the boy's toilette. In handing him the black pair of breeches, which Amy had presented me with, I saw marked, in Indian ink, what, being in the inside, had probably escaped her attention. It was the name of Proby.

How came Lord Proby's black small-clothes here? said I. Amy snatched them out of my hand, in a fury; and desired me to go out of the house. *Au reste*, she had oftent, at that time, three hundred pounds in her pocket at once, and poor Maddan had not & shilling. All this happened before l had left my home."


The history of Julia is thus introduced :—

"Julia's real name was Storer. She was the daughter of the Hon. Mrs Storer, who was one of the maid's of honour to our present King's royal mother, and the sister of Lord Carysfort.

Julia received part of her education in France, and finished it at the palace of Hampton-court, where her mother sent her on

a visit, to the wife of Colonel Cotton, who was an officer in the 10th Dragoons.—-- Mrs. Cotton had a family of nine children, and very little fortune to support them. Julia had been, from her earliest youth, encouraging the most romantic passions which ever fired a youthful breast. With all this, her heart, unlike mine, was as cold, as her imagination was warm. What were parents, what were friends to her? What was any thing on earth, to love! --- The first night Colonel Cotton danced with her, she was mad: In four months more, she was pregnant. In nine months more, having concealed ber situation, she was seized with the pangs of labour, while in the act of paying her respects to her Majesty in Court! and all was consternation in the beau chateau de Hampton! Mrs. Cotton, instead of sending for the accoucheur, with extreme propriety, though somewhat malapropos, loaded. poor Julia with abuse!

Have yet a little mercy, said Julia, and send for assistance.

Never, never, you monster!---you wretch! will I so disgrace your family, exclaimed Mrs. Cotton. Poor Julia's sufferings were short; but dreadfully severe. In about five hours, unassisted, she became the mother of a fine boy. Julia could not attempt to describe the rage and fury either of her mother or brother. It was harsh, it was shocking, even as applied to the most hardened sinner, in such a state of mental and bodily suffering. Julia was, with her infant, by her noble relatives, hurried inco the country, almost at the risk of her life, and Colonel Cotton was called out by young Storer, Julia's brother, and, I believe, wounded. From her retirement, Julia had contrived to write to Colonel Cotton, by means of Colonel Thomas, to declare to him, that if they were to meet no more, she would immediately destroy herself.

In short, Cotton was raving mud for Julia, and Julia was wild for Cotton --- *le moyen de les separer?*

A very retired cottage, near town, was hired by Cotton for Julia, who inherited a small fortune, over which her parents had no control; and on that she had supported herself, in the closest retirement, for more thau eight years, when I accidentally became acquainted with her.

Cotton was dismissed from his regiment by bis royal commander. I never saw such romantic people, after nine years and five children!

Julia, adored Julia! so he would write to her, if you love but as I do, we shall to-morrow, at eight in the evening, enjoy another hour of perfect bliss! ! Julia! angel Julia! iny certain death would be the consequence of your inconstancy, &c. &c. Julia ased to show me these rhapsodies from Cotton, at which l al rays laughed heartily, and thus I used to put her in a passio * continually."

"An opera box is now taken by Harriett, Fanny, and Julia, and they are surrounded by the beaux of the day.

Amy gives parties which vie with those of Lady Castlereagh; characieristic sketches are given of the visitors at those parties, including Counts Woronzow, Orloff, and Beckendorff, who was half mad to marry Amy; Luttrell, the Duke of Devonshire, Lord Nugent, Lord Alvenley, Beau Brummell, the Hon. Fred William Ward, Mr. John Mitchell, a rich sugar-baker, an admirer of Fanny's, his Excellency Count Palmella, a Portuguese candidate for Amy's favours, young Freeling, of the Post-office, Lord Frederick Bentinck, and others.

The season for Argyle's departure for the North now arrived; he spoke of Harriette's accompanying him, but she refused. She then describes her getting into debt, and the necessity she was under of getting some steady friend. The Duke of Wellington offers, through the medium of a convenient go-between, Mrs. Porter, of Berkeley-street, and he became a constant visitor. 'A most unentertaining one, Heaven knows!', She says, 'and in the evenings, when he wore his broad red ribbon, he looked very like a rat-cacher.'

Such is a specimen of the first Number of this singular pub-lication. Many parts of it are written with a warmth which, however it may suit the morals or manners of the age, does not meet our notions of propriety. We may, perhaps, hereafter glance at the remaining numbers.

GRAND MASQUERADE.- Charles Wright, so celebrated as the genuine promoter of Life in London, gives another Carnival at the Argyll Rooms to-morrow, *Valentine's day* --- rather an ominous occasion for such a festival. The celebrated Harriette Wilson, the commencement of whose memoirs will be found in another part of our paper, is to be present, and we trust will come in *good character*.

MASQuERADE. --— The second of these lively exhibitions during the present season, was given last night at the Argyle Koums, under the auspices of the indefatigable Mr. Charies Wright, of the Opera Colonade, whose exertions to promote the humour, and enliven ths spirits of the gay circles of the metropolis.
sant, and in most cases successful. The Rooms were crowded at an early hour, but after the theatres, the throng was still more numerous. The charactera were, as usual, of every denomination, and some of them were well sustained.--— What was wanting in merit, was fully supplied by the prevailing good humour, and as all came to be pleased, fun and frolic reigned triumpbant till a late hour this morning. A lady in a splendid domino, was pointed out as Harriette Wilson, now so much the subject of conversation in the fashionable circles; and it was not tilt she changed her costume, that she escaped persecution. Mrs. Wilson,
we have reason to believe, is at present in Paris.
