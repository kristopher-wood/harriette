Byron's correspondence with Harriette Wilson, from Ravenna, March 15th-May 15th 1820 (with context): (Source: Mss. not found; texts from Harriette Wilson's memoirs of herself and others, with a preface by James Laver, P. Davies 1929, pp.611-15; Byron's letters at BLJ VII 64-5 and 100-1)

Wilson writes: I think it was during this visit of mine to Paris, that I happened to be in want of money,
an exigency by no means unusual with me; and, having considered who was most likely to give it me,
after vainly applying to Argyle I fixed on Lord Byron, who was at that time in Italy: and I addressed
him as follows:

Paris, 15th March. MY DEAR LORD BYRON, I hate to ask you for money, because you ought not to pay anybody: not even turnpike men, postmen nor tax-gathering men: for we are all paid tenfold by your delicious verses, even if we had claims on you, and I have none. However, I only require a little present aid, and that I am sure you will not refuse me, as you once refused to make my acquaintance because you held me too cheap. At the same time, pray write me word that you are tolerably happy. I hope you believe in the very strong interest I take, and always shall take, in your welfare: so I need not prose about it. God bless you, my dear Lord Byron. H. W. By return of post, I received the following answer: Ravenna, March 30th. I have just received your letter, dated 15th instant, and will send you fifty pounds, if you will inform me how I can remit that sum; for I have no correspondence with Paris of any kind; my letters of credit being for Italy; but perhaps you can get someone to cash you a bill or fifty pounds on me, which I would honour, or you can give me a safe direction for the remission of a bill to that amount. Address to me at Ravenna, not Venice. With regard to my refusal, some years ago, to comply with a very different request of yours, you mistook, or chose to mistake the motive: it was not that "I held you much too cheap" as you say, but that my compliance with your request to visit you, would just then have been a great wrong to another person: and, whatever you may have heard, or may believe, I have ever acted with good faith in things even where it is rarely observed, as long as good faith is kept with me. I told you afterwards that I had
no wish to hurt your self-love, and I tell you so again, when you will be more disposed to believe me.
In answer to your wish that I shall tell you if I was “happy”, perhaps it would be a folly in any
human being to say so of themselves, particularly a man who has had to pass through the sort of
things which I have encountered; but I can at least say that I am not miserable, and am perhaps more
tranquil than ever I was in England.
You can answer as soon as you please: and believe me
Yours, etc.,
BYRON.
P .S. – Send me a banker’s or merchant’s address, or any person’s in your confidence, and I will get
Langle, my banker at Bologna, to remit you the sum I have mentioned.
It is not a very magnificent one; but it is all I can spare just now.
Answer:
Paris, 30 Rue de la Paix
Ten thousand thanks, dear Lord Byron, for your promt compliance with my request. You had better
send the money to me here and I shall get it safe. I am very glad to learn that you are more tranquil.
For my part, I never aspired to being your companion, and should be quite enough puffed up with
pride, were I permitted to be your housekeeper, attend to your morning cup of chocolate, damn your
nightcap, comb your dog, and see that your linen and beds are well aired, and, supposing all these
things were duly and properly attended to, perhaps you might, one day or other in the course of a
season, desire me to put on my clean bib and apron and seat myself by your side, while you
condescended to read me in your beautiful voice your last new poem!
Apropos! I travelled with a man lately who had just left you. I forget his name; a sort of a
lawyer as I guessed, because he would talk about the “parties” every few minutes.89 No! he could not
be quite so bad as that neither. I don’t know what he was; but he had not the least mite of skin on his
long, thin, straight nose. That had been all entirely burnt off, he said, while he was enjoying the
charms of your delightful society at Venice: Heaven defend me from such a nose, however poetically
bestowed upon me! Don Juan kept me up the whole of last night. I will not attempt to describe its
beauties, as they struck and delighted me; because that would be at the expense of another night’s
rest: and, what can I say to you, who know well that you are the first poet of this, I am inclined to think
of any, age? And, being this, as well as young and beautiful, why condescend to resent our sins against
89: This could not have been John Hanson, who had not visted B. since late 1818

you? A common man might as well be angry with a wasp, as Lord Byron with a common man, when he
is waspish towards him, and let me ask you what harm the commandments ever did you or those who
believe in them, since they teach nought but virtue. And what catchpenny ballad writer could not write
a parody on them as you have done? Souviens-toi comme tu es noble, et ne te mêle point de tout cela.
Let our religion alone, till you can furnish us with a more perfect creed. Till then, neither you nor
Voltaire will ever enlighten the world by laughing at it.
It would serve me right, were you to refuse to send me what you promised after my presumption
in writing you this sermon. However, I must be frank and take my chance, and, if you really wish to
convince me you bear no malice nor hatred in your heart, tell me something about yourself; and do
pray try and write a little better, for I never saw such a vile hand as yours has become. Was it never a
little more decent? True, a great man is permitted to write worse than ordinary people; mais votre
écriture passe la permission. Anyone, casting a hasty glance at one of your effusions, would mistake it
for a washer-woman’s laboured scrawl, or a long dirty ditty from some poor soul just married, who
humbly begs the favour of a little mangling from the neighbouring nobility, gentry and others! Look to
it, man! Are there no writing masters at Ravenna? Cannot you write straight at least? Dean Swift
would have taken you “for a lady of England!”
God bless you, you beautiful little ill-tempered, delightful creature, and make you as happy as I
wish you to be.
HARRIETTE
Can I forward you a bundle of pens, or anything?

Answer:
Ravenna, May 15th.
I enclose a bill for a thousand francs, a good deal short of fiftv pounds; but I will remit the rest by the
very first opportunity. Owing to the little correspondence between Langle the Bologna banker, I have
had more difficulty in arranging the remittance of this paltry sum, than if it had been as many
hundreds to be paid on the spot. Excuse all this, also the badness of my handwriting, which you find
fault with and which was once better; but, like everything else, it has suffered from late hours and
irregular habits.
The Italian pens, ink and paper are also two centuries behind the like articles in other
countries.
Yours very truly and affectionately,
BYRON
I should have written more at length, in reply to some parts of your letter; but I am at “this present
writing” in a scrape (not a pecuniary one, but personal, about one of your ambrosial sex), which may
probably end this very evening seriously. Don’t be frightened. The Italians don’t fight: they stab a
little now and then; but it is not that, it is a divorce and separation; and, as the aggrieved person is a
rich noble and old, and has had a fit of discovery against his moiety, who is only twenty years old,
matters look menacing.
I must also get on horseback this minute, as I keep a friend waiting.
Address to me at Ravenna as usual.
Wilson concludes: Lord Byron wrote me many letters at different times; but I have lost or mislaid
them all, except those which I have herein given, and can show to anyone who may be pleased to
question their being really originals.
