CHAPTER I. 

Death of the Duchess of York— The petition of a Newfoundland dog, ad- 
dressed to her Royal Highness — Bnimmell's memorandum on the back of 
it— George the Fourth arrives at Calais— The dinner at Dessin's— The 
Mayor unfortunately without a snuff-box — The King's remark on leaving 
the town — ^The Beau's increasing embarrassments— The tobacconist's

In the August of 1820, Brummell lost one of his 
best benefactors. The Duchess of York died on 
the 6th of that month. Deeply, and let us hope 
feelingly, did her pensioner deplore that event; 
for, by the demise of that amiable woman, he was 
deprived of one of his firmest friends, and much 
valuable assistance and sympathy, arising from her 
keen sense of the change in his position, and the 
generous impulses of a kind heart. 

'* Few characters," says Mr. Raikes, *' in any 
situation of life, could be placed in competition 
with the late Duchess of York ; she was not only 
a tres-grande dame, in the highest acceptation of the 
term, but a woman of the most sound sense and 
accurate judgment, with a heart full of kindness, 
beneficence, and charity. The former was amply 

VOL. II. B 



2 THE LIFE OF 

proved, by the adroitness and tact with which she 
so successfully avoided all collision with the cabals 
and tracasserieSy which for so many years unfortu- 
nately ruled in various branches of the royal family ; 
and the latter was attested by the constant attach- 
ment of her friends and dependants ; the gratitude 
of her poor neighbours during her life, and the un- 
disguised grief of all at her death. Whatever clouds 
(if indeed they ever existed) obscured the earlier 
part of her marriage, were in later times com- 
pletely dispersed; and nothing could equal the 
respect and attention with which she was always 
treated by the Duke, who rarely failed to consult 
her opinion, on most questions of real importance 
to his own interests. To the distinguished man- 
ners belonging to her rank, and a proper sense of 
the dignity befitting her exalted position in the 
country, she added a simplicity of character, and 
a general afiability, which placed every one at their 
ease, and gave a peculiar charm to her society. 
Endowed by nature with a very superior mind, 
which had been highly cultivated and improved 
by books, she was at all times able to take the lead 
on any subject ; her conversation was full of point, 
blended with great naivete^ and devoid of all sar- 
castic allusions ; she had a very refined taste, and 
a great knowledge of the world ; but, contrary to 



G£ORO£ fiRUMMELL. 3 

all received opinions, her study of mankind had 
never operated to check that feeling of general 
benevolence which formed the brightest gem in her 
character." 

The extraordinary passion that her Royal High- 
ness had for dogs, has been already mentioned; 
it was probably generally known, and accounts for 
the following curious petition having been sent to 
her, in the name of a fine Newfoundland, by some 
person who was desirous of having him well taken 
care of. 

TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUCHESS OF 
YORK, 

The humble Petition of Neptune 
Sheweth; 
That your Royal Highness's Petitioner, at an age 
so early that no trace of the circumstance is recorded 
in his memory, was torn from his fond mother and 
native mountains of Newfoundland, by an officer of 
the British navy, who during his life was a kind 
master to him; that, at his ever to be lamented death, 
your Royal Highness's Petitioner encountered many 
hardships of cold, hunger, and neglect; that he 
was rescued from this unhappy situation by an 
officer of miUtia, and by him sent as an offering of 
friendship to his present protector, who has ever 

b2 



4 THE LIFE OF 

treated him with kindness and humanity ! but alas ! 
your Royal Highnesses humble Petitioner is fated 
again to experience " the slings and arrows of out- 
rageous fortune," unless your Royal Highness, with 
that benevolence which marks every action of your 
life, will stretch out your humane hand to save him. 
The gentleman with whom he now resides, is under 
the necessity of leaving England, and, finding it 
inconvenient to make your Petitioner the compa- 
nion of his travels, intends to part with him, when 
he may become the slave of some unfeeling master, 
who may, in addition to the sufferings he has 
already endured, deprive him of that liberty he 
loves, the only blessing of which fate has never yet 
bereft him. 

Humbly then does your Royal Highness's Peti- 
tioner implore your Royal Highness to take him 
into your service, and every moment of his life, 
(if permitted,) shall be passed at your Royal feet, 
and his faithful mind be filled with fidelity, grati- 
tude, and attachment towards his Royal Benefac- 
tress : on the earth, or in the water, he will be a 
zealously-devoted attendant and humble friend, 
who will fawn, without meaning to flatter, and 
would endanger his own life to defend that of his 
generous Mistress, most happy to follow her Royal 
footsteps through the sequestered glades of Oat- 



GEORGB BRUMMELL. 5 

lands, pursue her carriage, panting with dutifiil 
devotion, or swim round her barge as it glides on 
the silver Thames. 

Without vanity, your Royal Highnesses Peti- 
tioner may boast of being, in strength, beauty, 
and fidelity, equal to any dog his frozen clime 
ever produced; and, happiest of the canine race 
will he be, if permitted the transcendent felicity of 
dedicating the remainder of his life to your Royal 
Highness's service. Oh ! most amiable Duchess, 
grant this, your Petitioner's humble prayer, and 
he, with all the fervour his heart and language 
are capable of, will ever, ever pray. 

Neptune. 

P.S. A line, by command of your Royal High- 
ness, addressed under cover to Mr. , 



street, Westminster, if your Royal Highness deigns 
to accept his services, will bring your Petitioner, 
with awful respect, to your gate. 

This petition was forwarded to the Duchess of 
York in September, 1815, and, on the back of 
a copy of it presented by Brummell to a friend 
of the author's, was the following note, which, 
from the appearance of the ink, had evidently 
been written by him a short time after her Royal 



b THE LIFE OF 

Highnesses demise — probably when looking over his 
portfolio of recollective relics. 

" The Duchess of York immediately sent for this 
amiable dog: his previous master would never 
reveal his name to her Royal Highness. Five years 
after, her Royal Highness, to the deep regret of 
all the world, died, and this poor animal walked 
in procession at her funeral. It is no romance, 
but the dog lingered in evident affliction, and died 
ten months after! The Duchess gave me this 
petition. '* George Brummell/' 

In the September of the following year, 1821, 
the greatest event of his Calais life took place; 
the royal personage at whose festive board he 
had in former days been so frequent a guest, 
arrived in that town. George the Fourth was on 
his way to visit his Hanoverian subjects, and the 
place was not a little shaken from its monotonous 
routine by that occurrence. Fishing boats were 
laid up, and the fishwomen set "all alive O" — the 
authorities furbished up their old uniforms, and the 
Duke d'Angoulfime, who had been deputed by 
Louis the Eighteenth to congratulate his Majesty 
on his arrival in the French dominions, received 
him at Dessin's Hotel, and there they put up their 
horses together. When the King landed, the pier 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 7 

was crowded with spectators, and as he stepped 
on shore from his barge, his hat fell from his 
hand : this accident a quick-witted urchin imme- 
diately took advantage of, and rushing forward, 
restored it to his Majesty, who put his hand into 
his pocket, and drew forth enough of the precious 
metals to provide his impromptu page with peg- 
tops and briocheSy for years to come. 

But where was the Beau all this time ? accord-^ 
ing to one rumour, he accompanied the Mayor 
to the landing-place, ready to profit by any op- 
portunity that might occur of placing himself in 
the King's way. But this is an error ; Brummell 
had gone out to take his accustomed walk in an 
opposite direction, and was returning to his lodg- 
ings at the very moment that his former patron, 
accompanied by the French ambassador, was pro- 
ceeding in a close carriage to the Hotel " I was 
standing at my shop door ;" said Mr. Leleux, '' and 
saw Mr. Brummell trying to make his way across 
the street to my house, but the crowd was so great 
that he could not succeed, and he w^as therefore 
obUged to remain on the opposite side. Of course, 
all hats were taken off as the carriage approached, 
and when it was close to the door, I heard the 
King say in a loud voice, ' Good God! Brum- 
mell !' the latter, who was uncovered at the time. 



8 THE LIFE OF 

now crossed over, as pale as death, entered the 
house by the private door, and retired to his room, 
without addressing me." 

A sumptuous dinner was given in the evening 
at Dessin's, and S^l^gue, Brummell's valet, who 
was a chef in his way, attended to make the punch ; 
he took with him, also, by his master's orders, 
some excellent maraschino, a liqueur to which 
he remembered the King was extremely partial, 
though cannelle was, I believe, his favourite dram. 
In the afternoon it was observed, his Majesty was 
not in his usual spirits; was this occasioned by 
his recognition of the morning, and to the uncer- 
tainty whether Brummell would make his appear- 
ance, or not? Chi lo sa? he never came — the 
maraschino at dinner diminished any unpleasant 
feeling (if it ever did exist) that the dread of such 
a contretemps might have created, and the even- 
ing passed off admirably. The Mayor, and several 
of the civil functionaries were invited and came to 
this fSte ; and after dinner, the King requested the 
former to lend him his snuff-box, but he replied, 
he did not take snuff, and had no box. The com- 
missaire de police, being a sharp specimen of that 
branch of the Government, immediately presented 
his ; his Majesty accepted it, took a pinch, which, in 
all probability, he allowed to fall on the floor, and 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. ^ 

the next morning sent him a gold box. It was on 
occasions like these that Greorge the Fourth dis- 
played his tact in bestowing favours, and Monsieur 
le Maire is said to have felt at that moment not 
a little annoyed that he did not carry a box. This 
gentleman was a wine-merchant, and a friend of 
Brumm^rs; he recommended him to several of 
his friends, and his wine being very bad, I believe 
that most of them found it difficult to forget and 
forgive the introduction. 

The morning after the King's arrival, every one 

of his suite, with the exception of Sir , 

now Lord r^^ called on him. His visitors 

remained some time, and before they took their 
leave, endeavoured to persuade him to request an 
interview with the King, as he returned to Eng- 
land ; Brummell had written his name in the book 
at Dessin's, but abstained from presenting himself, 
as he probably felt that a refusal to see him would 
be an indignity to which he did not choose to be 
exposed: though his finances at this time were 
any thing but flourishing, and an official appoint- 
ment of some kind would have been a most desira- 
ble thing for him, he felt, even in his difficulties, 
most unwilling to cringe to the only man who could 
grant him the favour he so much needed. It has 
been stated, that, during the King's stay at Calais, 



10 THE LIFE OF 

Brummell sent him a box of snuff, and that his 
Majesty, having previously heard that he was in 
distress, said, *' I understand what it means," placed 
a hundred pound note in it, and returned it by one 
of his suite, desiring him at the same time to say 
that he could not see him. 

The English papers gave out, that he stood in a 
conspicuous position in the lobby of the theatre, 
when the King went to his box, with the view of 
bringing their former intimacy to his remembrance, 
and profiting thereby ; and that His Majesty bowed 
to him, and sent him a present during the even- 
ing. Another edition of the story was, that the 
Beau's present of snuff was accompanied by two 
or three yards of sausages, that he had selected and 
purchased himself at some charcuiier's in the town, 
who was famous for these delicacies ; but sausages 
and Beau Brummell do not read consistently toge- 
ther. According to Mr. Leleux, the real version of 
the snuff-box story was this : — the Consul came to 
Brummell late one evening, and intimated that 
the King was out of snuff, saying, as he took up 
one of the boxes that were lying on the Beau's 
table, '* Give me one of yours." " With all my 
heart," replied Brummell, *' but not that box, for 
if the Kuig saw it I should never have it again r** 
implying thereby that there was some history 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 11 

attached to it in which His Majesty was concerned. 
On reaching the theatre, the Consul presented the 
snuff, when an exclamation followed the first pinch, 
and the King turning round said, "Why, Sir, where 
did you get your snuff? there is only one person 
that I know who can mix snuff in this way." '* It 
is some of Mr. Brummell's, your Majesty," repUed 
the Consul, and the conversation here closed. 

The next day the King left for Cassel ; and, as he 
seated himself in the carriage, he said to Sir Arthur 
Paget, who commanded the yacht that brought him 
over, " I leave Calais, and have not seen Brum- 
mell." This remark was heard by several persons 
who were assembled in the yard of Dessin's hotel, 
and leads to the conclusion that Brummell never 
received either money or message, and that the 
whole story was a fabrication. Mr. Leleux said, 
that had he been the King's debtor on this occasion, 
he must have known it, for that Brummell was at 
this time in great want of money, and remained so ; 
besides, directly he had any funds, he always paid 
a portion of his bills, which was not the case at this 
period. ^ i^" 

The King's visit, on which he had probably rested 
some hopes, produced no amelioration in the Beau's 
now reduced circumstances, and was only a source 
of annoyance to him. But the remark made by His 



12 THE LIFE OF 

Majesty to Sir Arthur Paget, implying that he had in 
some degree expected Brummell to make his appear- 
ance at the public levee held at the hotel, possibly 
diminished the fear he felt of receiving a rebuff. This, 
combined with the previous persuasions of those 
who wished him to do the best for himself, deter- 
mined him to make some approach to a meeting 
with His Majesty on his return, though he could 
not bring himself to call, without receiving some 
official intimation that such was the King's 
pleasure: by inscribing his name in the book at 
Dessin's, he had fulfilled the etiquette due to his 
Sovereign, and no one could presume to do more 
without receiving the Royal commands. The autho- 
rities expected that on his way back to England, 
the King would visit the Town Hall, and Brum- 
mell thought he should have been able to accom- 
plish his purpose on this occasion ; but the Royal 
visitor was much pressed for time, and hurried on 
board immediately after his arrival. Whether this 
circumstance was, or was not, unfortunate for 
Brummell, no one can tell now : His Majesty might 
perhaps have intended to bestow some mark of his 
favour upo4 him ; and if that was really the case, 
it was an adverse turn of fortune for Brunamell. 
On the other hand, it is so easy for royalty to make 
a mere signal, in obeying which no one can feel 



OBORGE BRUMMiBLL. 13 

that he is acting a servile part, that it is not unrea- 
sonable to conclude, that if George the Fourth had 
been generously disposed towards his impudent but 
luckless favourite, he would never have left him 
to endure the mortification that he must have felt, 
when he found his Majesty's recognition of him in 
the street was not followed by some message of 
a kind and gracious character. 

Brummell's affairs now became more and more 
embarrassed; the last years of his residence in 
Calais were passed in frequent applications for 
money to his relatives and friends, and, thanks to 
their kindness and the advances that were made 
from time to time by his banker, he was always 
able to show a good front to the world. It is 
rather singular, but no Englishman amongst this 
assemblage of debtors was more prompt in dis- 
charging the debts he owed to his different trades- 
men than Brummell, when fortune provided him 
with the means of doing so. During my stay at 
Calais, I was enabled to form an opinion of the 
estimation in which he was held by this class of 
people, and was glad to find it favourable. A 
feniale tobacconist, whose shop I entered with a 
friend, especially drew my attention to the fact 
— and this, without the possibiUty of her know- 
ing that I was interested in his history. I was

remarking, that the hotels were falleA off since 
I was last in Calais, and, in defending her native 
town from the aspersion thus thrown upon it, she 
replied, " Go and see Dessin's hefore you condemn 
them ; your King slept there once, (like many of 
her class in Calais, she spoke a little English;) 
apd do you know, a friend of his Uved here many 
years — ^we used to call him le Roi de Calais, he 
lodged at that house;" pointing to M. Leleux's, 
which was nearly opposite to hers. *' Ah ! c'dtait 
un bien brave homme, trfes-elegant, et avec beau- 
coup de moyens — he always paid his bills, Sir, 
and was very good to the poor ; and every one 
was very sorry when he left. I wonder," continued 
the bourgeoise, ** le Roi George did not take bettare 
care of his frandes." That part of her gossip re- 
lating to Brummell's charitable donations is per- 
fectly in character with the anecdote of his reply 
to the beggar who petitioned him for alms, even 
if it was only a halfpenny : " Poor fellow," said the 
Beau, in a tone of good-nature, '* I have heard of 
such a coin, but I never possessed one ; there 's 
a shilling for you ! " 

With Brummell's early history, every one in 
Calais was acquainted, and he was sometimes the 
subject of conversation, even amongst the English 
workmen of the tulle factories in the town. A 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 15 

friend of his who was not unlike him in his ge- 
neral appearance, was one day overtaken in his 
walk to the Citadel by two of them, and, as they 
passed, he overheard one of them say to the other, 
'*Now I'll bet you a pot, that's him." The gen- 
tleman did not hear the reply, but they had 
scarcely gone twenty yards further, when they 
turned suddenly round, and retracing their steps, 
one of them came straight up to him, and said, 
** Beg pardon. Sir, hope no offence, but we two 
has got a bet — now ain't you * George, ring the 
bell?'" The gentleman thus addressed, assured 
them that he was not Mr. Brummell, and the two 
tullistes having again made their rough apologies, 
departed to drink their pot at the next cabaret. 
What a pity it did not happen to be the Beau 
himself; what would have been his astonishment 
and reply to such an assault! 



CHAPTER II. 

The Beau in love — A visit from a friend of the lady's — Brummell's reply to 
his accusations — Extract from the " Letters of a German Prince" — This 
traveller at Constantinople — His black compagnon de voyage — Bmmmell 
endeavours to obtain an appointment — Is at length successful^ and made 
Consul at Caen— DiflSculty of leaving Calais — His liabilities— The sale of 
his buhl — Erection of the British Episcopal chapel — Brummell puts his 
name to the subscription-list — Is invited to meet the Bishop — Leaves 
Calais — The courier's account of their journey to Paris. 

During the latter part of his stay at Calais, the 
occupation of completing his screen being thrown 
aside, he found time so heavy on his hands, that 
he actually contrived to fancy himself in love with 
a young lady in her teens, and Rumour with her 
hundred tongues not only accused her of return- 
ing his passion, but insinuated that he had con- 
cocted a deep laid plan of abduction ! in this state 
of affairs, it was thought right to send a person 
to Brummell to demand an explanation — a very 
imnecessary measure, for there was not a word of 
truth in that part of the report. A gallant officer, 
full of years and commissariat glories, who once 
had a shoeing establishment in London that did 
not answer, was deputed to see Brummell on the 



THE LIFE OF GEORQE BRUMMELL. 17 

occasion ; the ambassador was well chosen, for he 
was both charitable and conscientious. He accord- 
ingly waited on him, and after explaining his busi- 
ness, expatiated most fully and eloquently on the 
heinous nature of the supposed oflfence ; in fact, 
said everything that would have been right and 
proper if the story had been really true. " Why 
Vulcan,'' said the gay Lothario, " what a precious 
old humbug you must be, to come and lecture me 
on such a subject! you who were for two years 
at hide-and-seek to save yourself from being shot 
by Sir T. S— ^ — , for running off with one of his 
daughters." ''Dear me, dear me," said the as- 
tonished mediator, little dreaming that his youthful 
follies were known to any one at Calais, *'you 
have touched a painful chord. It is true : I was 
once indiscreet myself; I will have nothing more 
to do with the business," — nor w£is there any ne- 
cessity, for the affair died a natural death. 

Amongst those who dropped in upon Brummell 
about this time, January, 1 829, was that amusing 
and veracious traveller, and profound judge of 
English society, the author of the Letters of a 
German Prince; and from this work I extract 
the portion which describes his visit, as it finishes 
with a speech perfectly characteristic of the Beau.

dutifully pays the former patriarch the tribute of 
a visit, or of an invitation to dinner. This I did 
also, though under my assumed name. Unfor- 
tunately, in the matter of dinner I had been fore- 
stalled by another stranger ; and I cannot therefore 
judge how a coat really ought to look ; or whether 
his long residence in Calais, added to increasing 
years, have rendered the dress of the former King 
of Fashion less classical, for I found him at his 
second toilette, in a flowered chintz dressing-gown, 
velvet night-cap with gold tassel, and Turkish slip- 
pers, shaving, and rubbing the remains of his teeth 
with his favourite red root. The furniture of his 
rooms was elegant enough, part of it might even 
be called rich, though faded; and I cannot deny 
that the whole man seemed to me to correspond 
with it. Though depressed by his present situa- 
tion, he exhibited a considerable fund of good 
, humour, and good nature. His air was that of good 
society, simple and natural, and marked by more 
urbanity than the dandies of the present race are 
capable of. With a smile he showed me his Paris 
peruke, which he extolled at the cost of the English 
ones, and called himself, * le ci-devant jeune homme 
qui passe sa vie entre Paris et Londres.' He ap- 
peared somewhat curious about me, asked me 
questions concerning people and things in London, 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 19 

without belying his good breeding, by any kind of 
intrusiveness ; and then took occasion to convince 
me that he was still perfectly well informed as to 
all that was passing in the English world of fashion, 
as well as of poUtics. ' Je suis au fait de tout/ 
exclaimed he, * mais ^ quoi cela me sert-il? on 
me laisse mourir de faim ici. J'esp^re pourtant 

que mon ancien ami le Due de W enverra un 

beau jour le consul d'ici k la Chine, et qu'ensuite 
qu'il me nommera k sa place. Alors je suis sauv^.* 
# # # # ^n^j surely the English nation ought in 
justice to do something for the man who in- 
vented starched cravats ! How many did I see 
in London, in the enjoyment of large sinecures, 
who had done far less for their country. As I took 
my leave, and was going down stairs, he opened the 
door, and called after me, * J'esp^re que vous trou- 
verez votre chemin ; . mon Suisse n'est pas Ik, je 
crains. ' ' H^las !' thought I, * point d'argent point 
de Suisse." ** 

It is a thousand pities that this German Prince 
did not remain another day at Calais, and give 
Brummell a dinner at Dessin's, as he proposed ; for 
he would have gained some information on tlic Hub- 
ject of *' how a coat really ought to look,'' which, 
judging from the one I saw him in ten yearn after, 
at Constantinople, he stood lamentably in nec<i of, 

c2 



20 THE LIFE OF 

— SO abundantly was it befrogged and bebraided. He 
was remarkable, too, in another respect, for he 
carried an eye-glass on the top of his cane, which 
being constantly in proximity to his nose, had a 
most comical effect. But, stranger still, he was that 
morning, and I understood usually, accompanied by a 
young Nubian girl, whose face was as black as his own 
boots, and much better polished, and who frolicked 
about him like a juvenile spaniel of King Charles's 
breed. This curious appendage was dressed in 
man'§ clothes, and she looked pretty, in spite of 
her ebony hue and crimson trowsers. I did not 
learn her exact history, which must have been a 
curious one. It was whispered (no doubt the scandal 
of some white woman) that her lover had rescued 
her from the jaws of a crocodile on the banks of the 
Nile! 

After the King's visit to Hanover, Brummell, at 
various intervals, tried to induce some of his power- 
ful friends to interest themselves in obtaining an 
appointment for him, and at length the Duke of 
York undertook to advocate his cause with Mr. 
Canning, and endeavour to prevail upon him to 
give effect to his wishes. The minister replied, that 
if his Royal Highness insisted on it he would do so, 
but that he could not recommend Mr. Brummeirs 
name to his Majesty on his own responsibility ; and 



GEOBGE BRUMMELL. 21 

this attempt failed. At a later period Lord A , 



knowing the distressed state that he was in, applied 
to the Duke of Wellington, who was then in 
power, and who good-naturedly undertook to men- 
tion the subject to William the Fourth. A paper 
of the day stated, that when the Whigs came into 
office, Brummell wrote to Lord Grey, and to several 
of his other friends of that pa: y, imploring them 
to do something for him, and that he owed his 
situation to that nobleman. But the Whigs did 
not assume the reins till 1831 ; and Brummell 
himself always said, that he owed his appointment 
entirely to the ** favourable consideration of the Com- 
mander-in-chief." The result was, that, on the 10th 
of September, 1830, he was entrusted with the ex- 
tensive commercial interests of the British nation, in ^ 
the capital of Lower Normandy. The remainder of his 
days were to be devoted to the inspection of persons 
with fronts ecrasesy cheveux roux, sourcils idem, yeux 
grisdtreSy nez retrousses, and visages bourgeonn^s ; 
and his lecture to the verification of passports, bills 
of lading, invoices, and mercantile papers of all 
kinds. '\ 

His very success in obtaining this consulate was 
however the source of fresh difficulties to him, for 
he could not leave the town till all his debts were 
paid, and they then amounted to a very large sum. 
His creditors were far from being urgent in their 



22 THE LIFE OF 

demands, as long as it was likely that he would re- 
main amongst them, but they were not at all inclined 
to part with him without a settlement of their ac- 
counts. To meet their demands he had a sale of 
his buhl furniture, which sold for a considerable 
sum. His Sevres china had been bought some time 
before by Mr. Crockford, junior, then an auctioneer ; 
who, according to his own statement, went over 
to Calais solely for the purpose of making this pur- 
chase. Mr. Crockford described this china as ** the 
finest and purest ever imported into England.^* 
George the Fourth gave two hundred guineas for 
one tea-set, and a pair of the vases was sold for three 
hundred pounds. Some of these rare specimens of 
porcelain are now in the possession of the Duke of 
Buccleugh. But the money raised by the sale of 
his buhl was insufficient to satisfy half the claims 
against him, his banker's account alone being at this 
time twelve thousand francs on the wrong side. 

It may appear strange that this gentleman should 
have advanced so large an amount on mere personal 
security, but it must be borne in mind that during 
Brummell's residence at Calais, particularly in the 
early part of it, large sums were lodged in Mr. 
Leveux's hands by him ; his prepossessing manner 
also, (for Mr. Leveux, like Mr. Leleux, said that 
*' on ne pourrait rien lui refuser,") was another 
inducement, as well as the circumstance of his being 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 23 

always seen in the company of every man of rank 
who came into the town. Many of them cashed 
their bills by Brummell's introduction at his bank, 
and it was perhaps this which induced Mr. Leveiix 
to accommodate him. A running account was 
therefore established between them, which, agree- 
ably to the advice given to his friend from the 
window, was always in advance, and amounted 
by degrees to the sum already mentioned. His 
other liabiUties were as follows :

24 THE LIFE OF 

The two tailors, Pion and Lamotte, were tyros in 
the art, and were only entrusted with repairs. His 
principal artiste in the way of clothes was a man of 
the name of Gaussin, who had been a prisoner in 
England, and returned to Calais after the peace in 
a very miserable condition. Finding that he had 
talent, Brummell patronized him ; this led others 
to do so, and the pauvre prisonnier was enabled, 
shortly after the Beau's departure, to retire to his 
*' otium" and cabbages in the country. In fact, 
most of those who had any pecuniary transactions 
with Brummell were well paid; and when, like 
Gaussin, they were the objects of his patronage, 
made their fortunes. Two chemists' bills also swell 
the list of small creditors ; but the reader need not 
fancy that he went to them for tonics, the barrel of 
Dorchester ale supplied the place of their villanous 
drugs : his sympathy on the score of health is not 
required just yet : their bills were simply for huile 
antique and cold cream. Three upholsterers look 
very like the departure of the buhl furniture and 
the ladies of his harem ; and the last item shows 
that in every possible instance he kept all his 
bankers in advance. The consumption of one 
hundred and seventy-six francs' worth of oils and 
cold cream, offers a pretty example of the extrava- 
gant character of his ordinary habits in dress. 

Admiration of the hydropathic cure is now the 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 25 

fiishionable medical epidemic; and though prodi- 
gality is not separately named in the long list of 
maladies which Mr. Claridge has assured us may 
be cured at Graffenberg, there can be but- little 
doubt that^ £is this disease is a mere species of mad- 
ness, it might be successfully treated there. Two 
or three months of the doctor's mild but invigorat- 
ing system of, sitz baths, douche baths^ curds and 
whey, wet sheets, sour krout, and hewing wood, 
would have been of infinite service to the Beau; 
and, cured, like a Westphalian ham, he would 
have arrived at Caen a perfect specimen of pru- 
dence and economy; unfortunately, however, the 
planet Priessnitz had not then risen to us. 

But Brummell was not only prodigal of his cold 
cream, but of his promises, and when his cash was 
low, no one in Calais was more prompt to make 
them, or to attach his signature to a list of sub- 
scribers for any purpose than he W£is. In 1829, 
when a collection was made for the erection of an 
Episcopal chapel in that town, the person appointed 
to go round did not omit to pay him a visit and 
request his support. ''Really, Mr. F.," said Brum- 
mell, " I am very sorry you did not call last week, 
for it was only yesterday that I became a Catho- 
lic ; — ^but, never mind, put my name down for a 
hundred francs." So very handsome a subscript 



26 THE LIFE OF 

tion had its effect, and some time after this, he 
received an invitation from the Consul to dine 
with Dr. Luscombe, the Paris diocesan, and those 
entrusted with the erection of the edifice ; which, 
however, he decUned as follows : — 

My dear Marshall, 
You must excuse me not having the pleasure to 
dine with you and the Trustees of the Church 
establishment this day. I do not feel myself suf- 
ficiently prepared in spirit to meet a bishop, or in 
pocket, to encounter the plate after dinner ; more- 
over, I should be a fish out of water in such a con- 
vocation. 

Truly yours, 

George Brummell. 

It is scarcely necessary to say, that the church 
was not built with his money. 

To decline an invitation of this nature was, how- 
ever, with him a circumstance of rare occurrence, 
more particularly when it came from Mr. Mar- 
shall ; yet it is said to have been at a dinner-party 
at this gentleman's house, that he gave the follow- 
ing perfect specimen of his prodigious impudence : 
— on the occasion in question, he was as usual 
accompanied by one of his canine favourites, who 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 



27 



crouched at his feet during the repast, and, as will 
be seen also, partook of the feast. Amongst the 
delicacies handed round was a roasted capon, stuffed 
with truffles, from which Brummell very consider- 
ately helped himself to a wing : this, on tasting, he 
fancied was tough, and taking it up in his napkin, 
he forthwith called his dog, and addressing him, 
said aloud before the astounded guests and his hor- 
rified host, " Here, Atous ! try if you can get your 
teeth through this, for I'll be d— d if I can ! " 

For a while it was doubtful whether Brummell 
would be able to enter upon his consulate, and 
two or three weeks elapsed before he could induce 
Mr. Leveux to advance twelve thousand francs, the 
sum necessary to remove the impediments to his 
departure. To secure the repayment of this, in 
addition to the twelve thousand already overdrawn, 
he, according to the due forms of law, made over 
to that gentleman, by a letter of assignment to Mr. 
Hertslett, of the Foreign Office, three hundred and 
twenty pounds per annum, being all but eighty, of 
his salary as consul. These were hard terms to 
subscribe to, for they completely crippled his 
finances : he could look forward to little else than 
an uninterrupted series of difficulties for the rest of 
his life, and such was the result; but the case 
was imperative. Towards the end of September, 



28 THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 

1830, he was permitted to leave the town in which 
he had vegetated for fourteen years, and we may ima- 
gine he was not in very high spirits. Through the 
kindness of his friend the consul, he was, however, 
enabled to reach Paris with a king's messenger, 
and of course free of expense. 

This silver greyhound was a very aristocratic Mer- 
cury, and duly appreciated the honour of travelling 
with so celebrated a character as Beau Brummell. 
On his return to Calais, Mr. Marshall was curious 
to know how they had fraternized on the road, and 
asked him what kind of a travelling companion he 
found Mr. Brummell ? expatiating at the same time 
on his powers of conversation, his fame, and amus- 
ing qualities : — " Oh, a very pleasant one, indeed, 
Sir, very pleasant," replied the messenger. " Yes, 
but what did he say?" said Mr. Marshall. "Say, 
Sir, why nothing ; he slept the whole way." *' Slept 
the whole 'way ! " replied Mr. M., '' do you call 
that being pleasant ? perhaps he snored. " The 
bearer of despatches acknowledged that he did so ; 
but immediately, and as if fearful of casting an 
improper reflection upon so great a personage, he 
added, with great gravity, "yet I can assure you. 
Sir, Mr. Brummell snored very much like a gen- 
tleman." 



CHAPTER III. 

Brammell at Paris — Passes a week there — Orders a snaff-box at Dabert's — 
Arrives at Caen — ^Takes ap his abode at Madame de St. Ursain's — His old 
Talet leaves him — A French cafe — Bnimmell^s letter to Mr. Marshall, 
describing his reception at Caen — ^Talleyrand — Monsieur Target — Colonel 
de la Pommeraye — Monsieur de Montrond — Sketch of his chailicter. 

The streets of Paris were graced by the Beau's 
presence for a whole week, and during this time 
he was the frequent guest of Lord Stuart de Rothe- 
say, and several members of the haute voice of the 
French capital. After having been fourteen years 
in a dirty fishing-town, he must have enjoyed him- 
self most uncommonly ; but I shall say nothing 
of his friends, as he records their hospitality with 
his own pen. Dreadful repletion, however, must 
necessarily have ensued from dining at such tables 
as those of the Prince of Benevento, Lord Stuart 
de Rothesay, and Madame de Bagration ; but though 
bad nights, and splitting head-aches, were in all 
probability the consequence, he contrived to rise 
sufficiently early to pass in review all the snufi- 
boxes in the Palais-Royal and the Rue de la Paix, 
but not one could he find worthy of his selection. 



30 THE LIFE OF 

and he therefore left an order at Dabert's for an 
enamelled gold one, which when made was to cost 
the trifling sum of two thousand five hundred 
francs, — more than his year's income. 

On the 5th of October, the Beau arrived in 
Caen, having travelled post from Paris in a carriage 
hired for the occasion, and with his valet Sel^gue 
in the rumble, four horses and two postilions, 
he drove up amidst a/ew d artifice from their whips 
to the H&tel de la Victoire ; the porte-cochere 
was thrown open, and in rolled his Britannic 
Majesty's representative, George Brummell. Hig- 
gling for francs, would have been unworthy of a 
man loaded with all the honours of a consulate, 
and therefore, stepping from his carriage, he or- 
dered the cook (who he mistook for the landlord, 
and into whose greasy arms he nearly fell) to let 
him have *' the best rooms, the best dinner, and 
the best Laffitte." 

A week after, he was located in the Rue des 
Cannes, at the house of Madame Guernon de Saint 
Ursain, and his old valet having remained a few 
days to initiate his successor into his duties, he 
made his bow and departed. This man, who 
figures for so large a sum in the list of Calais 
creditors, certainly did not lose by attending him 
in that capacity for thirteen years : after his return 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 31 

to that town, he removed to Boulogne, and, with 
the money that he had saved in the Beau's ser- 
vice, set up the Caf(^ Sdlegue in the Grande Rue. 

But the retired valet's ambition did not centre 
itself in coffee and coffee-pots only; not content with 
his caf(^, he speculated and took an hotel. All went 
on well for some years, but the jealousies of rival 
landlords, the invasion of Louis-Napoleon, and the 
Thiers war-cry, laid his hopes prostrate ; the hotel 
proved a losing concern, and he was at last obliged 
to confine himself to the business of simple cafe- 
tier. His caf(^ is one of the best in Boulogne ; 
and the fact of his having been chamberlain to such 
a distinguished character as Beau Brummell, may 
possibly induce the juvenile exquisite, as he passes 
through the town, to turn in there (if it still 
exists) for an ice; for, as white neck-cloths are 
coming in again, he may like to ascertain, with 
precision, how the Beau's were folded, and to what 
degree they were starched. But a cafe in a French 
provincial town, is not exactly the place to 
which those should resort whose ideas of clean- 
liness are of the same stamp as Brummell's, who, 
I can assure the reader, was never, during his 
fourteen years' residence at Calais, guilty of enter- 
ing one. It would indeed, have been surprising 



32 THE LIFE OF 

had he done so, for it is scarcely possible to con- 
ceive any thing farther removed from that virtue 
than one of these receptacles for sulky husbands, 
swell shop-boys, and dirty and idle politicians — to say 
nothing of the delight of sitting in a concentrated 
essence of bad smells, animal and vegetable, and in 
the midst of a shower of refreshing expectorations. 
But, to return to the Beau: he had scarcely 
taken possession of his lodgings at Caen, when he 
found his table covered with the cards of the 
best French families in the town. With a gossip, 
ing dowager for a landlady, and eight or ten of 
the same species in the same street, his former 
history was soon the topic of general conversa- 
tion, and his society was at once courted and de- 
sired ; but, of his proceedings during the first three 
weeks after his arrival, his own humorous letter 
to the consul at Calais gives the best account. 

October 25th, 1830. 

My dear Marshall, 

You would certainly before this have heard de 
mes nouvellesj had I not been occupied and put out 
of my usual passive way of existence by endeavour- 
ing to settle myself in this place. After passing a 
week in Paris en route j (I wish, by the bye, I had 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 33 

never seen it, for Stuart* and several of my frienda. 
have spoilt me for at least a year to come,) I arrived 
at my destination, and underwent all the horrors, 
and all the more horrible cheating, of one of the 
worst hotels, I am confident, in Europe ; though 
they tell me it is the best here. During seven 
days I gnawed bones upon unwashed dowlas in this 
charnel-house — ^what a difference, after Stuart, Tal- 
leyrand,! Madame de Bagration,} and Montrond ! 
and during seven nights I thought it necessary to 
scratch myself without sleeping, though I must, in 
justice, say, I believe there was no occasion for such 
penance. Good fortune at length led my steps to 
an admirable lodging, half a house, the property of 
a most cleanly y devout old lady, (the cousin of Guer-

Court, and always a very kind friend of Brummeirs.

much more highly than he did an oath, and, indeed, was a far 
better judge of one, though he swallowed nearly as many of the 
latter as he did of the former — his very name puts one in mind 
of a delicacy. His cuisine was perfect, and he is said to have 
been kept alive by his cook rather than his physician ; for his 
digestive powers were exceedingly impaired, and required the 
most delicate management. Monsieur de Talleyrand was born at 
Paris on the 7th of March, 1754, and died there on the 17th of

tage that families can do — the best possible educa- 
tion in every branch, both male and female, that the 
whole of France can produce. The two leading Am^ 
phitryons de nos compatriotes established in Caen are 
Messrs. Villiers and Burton, two very good men of 
independent fortune, with numerous families. Their 
houses, and, without exaggerating, they are like 
Devonshire House, or the Embassy at Paris, are 
generally open at half-past five to a well-provided 
dinner, and. Heaven knows, I have as yet profited 
most abundantly by their kindness, and always j7or<^5 
ouveries in the evening. The French of the best 
class mingle much in this society, and there is 
always a fiddle for the amusement of the young 
ladies. I am doing all that I can to make all par- 
ties satisfied with me. I condole with the outs, 
and agree with the ins : as to my own nation, I 
have called upon all who are worthy of such a 
compliment. I shake hands and gossip with the 
fathers and mothers, and pat all their dirty-nosed 
children upon the head, and tell them that they are 
beautiful. What can I do more with my scanty 
means ? 

I foresee, that little or nothing is to be made 
of my department ; nHmporte, I shall try something 
in the spring to better it. I am perfectly con-

it makes fine or bad weather.

[The Monsieur de Montrond mentioned by 
Brummell in this letter died at Paris, in Novem- 
ber, 1843, and the following sketch of his cha- 
racter is, with some trifling variation, abridged from 
a French paper. His first appearance in the fash- 
ionable world of Paris, which was shortly before the 
Revolution of 1789, was of the most dashing de- 
scription ; and this to the astonishment of every 
one, for, as in the case of Beau Wilson, nobody 
knew of his having any resources : but this was 
of little consequence ; he was amiable and generous, 
with naturally pleasing and persuasive manners, 
which he perfected by the most careful study; 
these, combined with the brilliancy and charms of 
his conversation, formed a spell so potent that 
he exercised a despotic influence over persons of 



38 THE LIFE OF 

all ranks and classes. One man of no slight cele- 
brity in our times submitted, in common with 
minds of far superior power, to the fascination of 
this irresistible seducer. M. de Montrond was 
from the first his petted pupil, and afterwards be- 
came his all trusted confidant and inseparable com- 
panion; that man, who betrayed so many kings 
and friends, who made a jest and a mockery of 
the powers of Heaven and of earth, never once 
swerved in his fidelity to this — ^his one friend. 
De Montrond, Uke his patron, was a perfect speci- 
men of diplomatic caoutchouc, — he had suppleness, 
and a born character for trickery and intrigue, 
and therefore did not fail to improve under the 
tuition of such a master. 

On M. de Talleyrand's first mission to England, 
under the republic, he accompanied him, and played, 
though not oflScially, such a skilful part, that the 
minister promised him that talents so admirable 
should not be allowed to rust ; important oppor- 
tunities for exercising them afterwards presented 
themselves. Mrs. Grant, the Bishop's mistress^ 
was to be converted into his wife, and Monsieur 
de Montrond was despatched to Rome to obtain 
a dispensation from the Pope ; he succeeded, and, 
for once in his life, Talleyrand was grateful. De 
Montrond possessed not political ambition, honour 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 39 

and places were but slight temptations to him, 
but he was inordinately fond of money; not to 
hoard, but to lavish in every kind of luxury, and 
his friend provided him with the means of gratifying 
aU his wishes, by giving him such information on 
state secrets as enabled him to speculate with suc- 
cess and also a good share in his own thrifty schemes. 
On one occasion, he realized, by a Uttle secret 
operation, a clear bonus of two milUons of francs. 
"Now you are a rich fellow," said his patron. 
" Yes, it is a pretty Uttle picking enough." '* Really, 
de Montrond, you must make some good use of 
this capital." " Rely upon me for that." '' And 
where shall you put this two millions?*' "Why, 
where should I," said de Montrond ; " in my secr^- 
tairCf of course." He did so, or into a stocking ; 
but the amount soon disappeared, and he was as 
far from being, Uke his friend, a capitalist, as ever. 
Entirely absorbed in the pleasures of the day, he 
cared not to provide for the future, the idea never 
entered his head: all he desired was to maintain, 
as long as he could, the magnificence which at- 
tracted all eyes ; the reputation of a Grand Sei- 
gneur, and, most inconsistently, that of an inimita- 
ble petit-maitre. Of course, penury occasionally 
followed close upon his opulence ; yet, he went on 
his way rejoicing, day after day, thoughtless as a 



40 THE LIFE OF 

bird ; sometimes with a hundred thousand Napo- 
leons in his pocket, sometimes not five; but his 
gaiety and good temper never deserted him, and he 
used often to say, " Egad, I can't hate anybody, 
not even people who have done me a service." 
He had, however, his enemies. Murat, in his 
coarse dragooning style of abuse, speaking of him 
and Monsieur de Talleyrand, said, " They are a 
couple of dung-heaps in silk stockings/' — ^but, 
with all this coarseness, the Marshal was by far 
the finest fellow of the three. 

One day a Princess of the Imperial family ex- 
pressed to M. de Montrond her astonishment at his 
profound attachment to Talleyrand. "Ah, madame,'* 
he replied, with a mixture of slyness and naivete^ 
*' how can one help loving him ? he is so deUciously 
full of vice !" After the Restoration, the Prince de 
Benevento preserved his credit and influence, and De 
Montrond his estabUshment, his luxuries, and his 
bonnes fortunes. He was a man over whom time 
seemed to have no power; from first to last he 
was the same gay, gallant, fighting, frivolous, gam- 
bling, devil-may-care sort of fellow. The death oC 
M. de Talleyrand was the one sole grief of his life ^ 
the only tear he ever shed was for him ; for M. d« 
Talleyrand had been more than his friend, he ha«i 
been his good genius, who had ever strown showexr 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 41 

of gold in his path. Even on his death-bed the 
patron did not forget his long-cherished prot^g^ ; 
and he left him certain state secrets, with their 
proofs, which M. de Montrond well knew how to 
use. Such was his influence to the last, that, only 
a few days before his death, when the poUce ven- 
tured to make an inroad upon his salon, in order to 
seize what they, not very erroneously, believed to 
be a gambling bank, de Montrond had only to make 
a representation of the circumstance at the Tuile- 
ries, and forthwith the pr^fet of police got a sound 
rating for the outrage^ and M. de Montrond a hand- 
some indemnity.] 

Of M. de Montrond*8 claims to admiration, as a 
clever tool, and a very agreeable companion, there 
cannot, I suppose, be any doubt ; but to have been 
a whole life the friend of M. de Talleyrand, is 
enough to damn any man's character with pos- 
terity. 



## CHAPTER IV. 

Brummell's morning yidtors — His hospitaHtj^Mr. Jones and the '' p&U 
de foie gras'' — Comment on tlie Beau's letter to the consul at Calais — 
The English society at Caen — Intruders upon Brummell's acquaintance — 
The consequences of it — A misapprehension — ^A letter from the Beau, de- 
scribing a singular conversation that occurred at a " soir^ " — A sonnet to 
Moggy— Brummell's patronage of his young favourites. 

The appointment of Brummell to the consulate 
of Caen was known in that town long before he 
made his appearance there, and the representations 
of the dowager his landlady, already alluded to, and 
more particularly those of Madame le Marquise de 
Seran, who had known him in London during the 
emigration, made all the young Frenchmen of the 
Carlist party anxious to become acquainted with him. 
About a month after he was domiciled in the Rue des 
Carmes three of them paid him a morning visit, and 
found him, though late in the day, over head and 
ears in all the mysteries of his toilet. They were 
of course anxious to retire immediately, but Brum- 
mell opposed their departure. '* Pray stay. Mes- 
sieurs," said the Beau, as he laid down the silver 
tweezers with which he had just removed a strag- 
gling hair, "pray remain; I have not yet break- 



THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 43 

fasted — no excuses ; there is a pdte de foie grasy a 
pain de gihier^^ and many other damties that he 
enumerated with becoming gastrpnomic fervour. 
A sense of modesty, however, rather an unusual 
virtue when the appetite of a gourmand is concerned, 
prevailed, and the goose's liver failed to overcome 
the scruples of three of the most noted hon vivants 
in Caen. Enchanted with Brummell's politeness, 
hospitality, and attractive powers of conversation, 
they took their leave, with many expressions of 
cordiality. One of the trio, relating the circum- 
stance a few hours after, remarked that " he must 
Uve very well." They Uttle imagined that it was 
only the extreme improbability of their accepting 
his invitation that induced him to be so exceedingly 
pressing, and to ofier them such a magnificent repast. 
Had they taken him at his word, they would have 
found themselves very nearly in the same pUght as 
the guest of the Barmecide, for the poUte and hos- 
pitable gentleman had positively nothing in the 
house at the time but a penny roll, and the coffee 
simmering by his bedroom fire. 

With the juniors of this class of French society 
he was soon on the most intimate footing. They 
gained his heart by capital dinners, for Brummell 
was the prince of gourmets. But a good dinner 
would have reconciled him to any class of people : 



44 THE LIFE OF 

his exclusiveness immediately gave way to an in- 
vitation; and he would condescend to waive any 
objections that he might have had to the vulgarity 
of his entertainer, in the consideration of the excel- 
lence of his Sillery and a dinde trvffee. Thus it was 
that he frequently visited in houses he would seldom 
have entered, had he *not been enticed within their 
walls by the delightful odours that came steaming 
from their kitchens on the rez de chauss^e. 

On the Beau's arrival in Caen he really had ?i.pdt^ 
defoie gras, to which a droll story is attached. A 
morning visitor having called, he asked him, as he 
took his leave, how he intended to pass the even- 
ing. " Why I dine at Mr. Jones's, in the Rue ," 

he repUed ; " there 's a party, and a few people in 
the evening." " Well, I think I shall dine there 
too," said Brummell, musing. " But you have no 
invitation, have you?" *'None; but never mind, 
I shall dine there: so, au revoir." His new ac- 
quaintance left, wondering how he would manage 
to get invited, and firmly convinced that his tactics 
must equal Theodore Hook's if he succeeded ; for 
Mr. Jones was a radical, and a retired soap-boiler, 
and he had often heard him severely condemn the 
" profligate appointment of such a man to superin- 
tend the interests of the British nation at Caen." 

Mr. Jones and his friends had proceeded to the 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 45 

dining-room before Brummeirs morning visitor ar- 
rived, and great was his astonishment, when, on 
bowing to the lady of the house, as he took pos- 
session of the vacant chair, he saw Brummell seated 
next her, evidently in immense favour, and making 
himself as agreeable as he. possibly could. The 
singular plan adopted by the*^ consul to obtain his 
invitation, and his still more singular proceedings 
on leaving Mr. Jones's house, transpired the next 
day. It should be observed, that, during his short 
stay at Paris, Brummell had not only remembered 
to order a hundred-guinea snuflf-box, but also to 
purchase the pdte already mentioned, at Ch^vet's, 
the marchand de comestibles, in the Palais-Royal. 
He had not touched it on his journey ; and, when 
this dinner was mentioned, it suddenly struck him, 
that, to present it to Mr. Jones, would be a good 
preliminary measure towards receiving an invita- 
tion : he therefore immediately despatched the 
pdt^, and a note, to that gentleman, stating that 
he had just heard that he was going to give a 
dinner, that the delicacy was of no earthly use to 
him, and begged that he would accept it sans fagon. 
The courtesy appeared so disinterested, and the 
pie so inviting, that they, conjointly, softened the 
patriotic indignation of the sturdy Jones, and 
his acknowledgments, and a request that the inca- 




46 THE LIFE OF 

pable representative of his Britannic Majesty would 
dine with him at five o'clock, were speedily re- 
turned. It has been shown that he went, and on 
the following morning Brummell's acquaintance 
again called on him, and very naturally expressed 
a pardonable curiosity to learn how he had con- 
trived to attain his object, when the Beau briefly 
related to him the above. " Admirable tact, in- 
deed,*' said his visitor, *' but I never saw anything 
of the pdte'r " True," replied Brummell, '' I was 
on the qui vive for it all dinner-time, and eyed 
every dish that came in; but, as you very justly 
remark, it never made its appearance, and dis- 
agreeably surprised I was. My dear sir," said the 
Beau, in a solemn tone, " the pdte was a splendid 
pdte, a chef d^oBuvre ; and I felt deeply interested in 
its fate. Accordingly, while I was in the passage 
putting on my cloak to come away, I desired my 
servant to inquire of the cook why it was not at 
table, and what had become of it ; when they told 
him that Monsieur had kept it for Master Henry's 
birthday. Had it been destined for his father's, its 
fate, though unworthy, would have been support- 
able ; but to be the piece de resistance of a nursery 
dinner, to be the prey of all the little Joneses 
and their * bonnes ' was atrocious ; sir, it was an 
insult to me and my pie. * Go,' said I to Isidore, 



ge6tige brummell. 47 

* go back to the kitchen, and say that I particularly 
desire to see the pdte de foie gras.^ He soon re- 
turned with it ; and, feeling that it would have been 
a sin to leave it with such people, I ordered him to 
put it into the carriage, and followed it without 
delay. It was not honest, but as I cut into it this 
morning at breakfast, I almost felt justified, for I 
never inserted my carving-knife into such another." 
The families mentioned in the letter to Mr. 
Marshall, the consul at Calais, were, with occasional 
exceptions, the only two amongst the English who 
entertained on a large scale, and Brummell was 
quite correct in saying that he availed himself 
abundantly of their hospitality. It continued unin- 
terrupted till they left, which, fortunately for him, 
was not till some years after. But the description 
that he gives in his letter to Mr. Marshall, of the 
houses of these friends, in which he was so well re- 
ceived and fSted, is not a little exaggerated; and 
was probably owing to his having passed fifteen 
years in the small rooms of a much smaller town. 
He must have been wandering when he drew such 
a tableau, and asserted that the Club at Caen was 
as large as Brookes's ; or that the other houses to 
which he alludes were like Devonshire House, or 
the British Embassy at Paris. It is really like Mr. 
Clarke's magnificent restoration of Pompeii. To 



48 THE LIFE OF 

make the sketch perfect, Brummell should have 
said, that the fiirniture and decorations of their 
interiors were also similar. 

The English society at Caen, at this period, 
was, generally speaking, good, much superior, in 
point of respectability, to that of many towns along 
the coast and in the interior ; but still it was of a 
mixed character, and there were some individuals 
with whom his consular duties brought him in con- 
tact, that he had a decided aversion to include in 
the number of his associates : others, who had not 
even the grounds of public business to justify 
their entering upon personal communication with 
him, forced themselves upon his acquaintance 
whenever an opportunity oflfered. Such persons 
he studiously avoided, for his frigid demeanour had 
not the slightest eflfect upon them. They conti- 
nually pestered him with civilities (not dinner-par- 
ties), merely with a view of gratifying their vanity, 
by being able to assert that they knew him ; this, 
he naturally saw through, and the impertinent intru- 
sion generally met with a sarcastic rebuke, which his 
gallantry did not prevent him from administering 
to the presumptuous, even among the fair sex. 

One of the delinquents who suflfered somewhat 
severely for pressing herself rather unceremoniously 
upon his notice, was a Mrs. G., a daughter-in-law 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 49 

of iEsculapius ; she was rather a pretty woman, 
but always apmg the great lady, a character most 
difficult to play before Brummell : for this reason, 
in particular, the M.D.'s wife was his aversion, and 
he seized every occasion that presented itself of 
administering wholesome correction to her foible. 
He knew, that to have the celebrated Beau Brum- 
mell at her house, was the darling object of her am- 
bition ; and, that to be able to write to her friends 
in England that he had graced her one room, was 
an event that by good management she fondly 
hoped ultimately to bring about. This apartment 
was immediately over the gateway of the hotel at - 
which Brummell sometimes dined; and one day, 
as he and a friend were passing under it to take 
a walk on the Cours Cafarelli, they were detected 
by the ever-watchful lady, who, modiste-likey was 
sunning herself with folded arms on her balcony. 

The" opportunity was not allowed to escape, and 
the promenaders, unconscious of the presence of 
the divinity above, were suddenly arrested by the 
mellifluous and persuasive tones of her voice, say- 
ing, " Good evening, Mr. Brummell." The gentle- 
men stopped, raised their heads, and Mr. W., his 
hat ; but his companion had sufficiently discom- 
posed the folds of his cravat by looking up, and 
they were on the point of resuming their walk, 

VOL. II. E ^ 

s 



50 THE LIFE OF 

when his aversion again interrupted his onward 
course, by calling out, *' Now won't you come up, 
and take tea?'* Severe, indeed, was the expres- 
sion of Brummell's countenance at this extraordi- 
nary address from a person with whom he was 
scarcely on bowing terms ; he was motionless, and 
for half a minute speechless : collecting his scat- 
tered senses, however, he again raised his eyes, 
— those small grey eyes, petillant d'esprity with 
laughter in each comer — and addressed the follow- 
ing laconic, pithy, and impudent reply to " the lady 
on the first-floor front :" — ** Madam, you take medi- 
cine, you take a walk, you take a liberty, but you 
drink tea :" this he was determined not to do, and 
without another word, made a stiff bow, pressed 
the arm, of his friend, which he had not relin- 
quished, and proceeded on his way. 

At this time, the year of his arrival, he had all 
his wits about him, was quite equal to his repu- 
tation, and his sarcastic vein was very droll and 
amusing to those who were not at the moment the 
objects of his satire; but, friends and foes aUke 
left his presence with the conviction that each would 
in turn be served up, cL la Tartdre, for the amuse- 
ment of his neighbours : he was in fact a walking 
lampoon; every individual that came within the 
sphere of his vision was subjected to his censorious 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 51 

spirit. The best houses did not escape, not even 
those in which he received the most kindness : a 
French family in the neighbourhood had given a 
dinner^ almost expressly on his account^ and 
every thing had been done to make it perfect, if 
possible ; the ortolans had been sent from Tou- 
louse, and the salmon from Rouen, and the com- 
pany were legitimists to the back-bone. The morn- 
ing after this fSte some one who met him inquired 
how the diner commande had passed off? when the 
Beau, lifting up his hands, and shaking his head in 
a deprecatory manner, said, *' Don't ask me, my 
good fellow ; but, poor man, he did his best/* 

Of those among his countrymen and women, 
whose manners were not quite so polished as they 
might have been, he would observe, " How can 
such people be received ? it is deplorable to be in 
such society ! " Brummell affectioned all those 
who fell in with his own ideas, or appeared to make 
observations in a similar vein. Very soon after I 
was introduced to him, I found that I had unwit- 
tingly gained his approbation by a remark acci- 
dentally made in this spirit, or rather, that he 
chose to construe it as such : the circumstance 
occurred at a large evening party, when, after 
having made my bow to the lady of the house, 
I approached the .fire-place and said to one of the 

e2 



52 THE LIFE OF 

company, who I thought was in the country, 

*' Why, Mr. D , are you here ? " Brummell 

overheard the exclamation, and imagined that I 
meant to imply that he was not fit to be there ; 
whereas it was a simple expression of surprise, 
and of a totally different kind. Satirical remarks, 
like those I have cited, were of course repeated 
again and again by those to whom they were made^ 
especially as they were generally accompanied by 
some capital hon moty which was laid upon the 
victim of the moment. It may therefore be easily 
imagined that Brummell was not very popular with 
this class of his countrymen ; but, as those a grade 
above them were, Uke the generality of the world, 
always ready to laugh at the vulgarities and infirm- 
ities of those below them, he was never cordially 
condenmed, — on the contrary, they were delighted, 
and remained on excellent terms with him so long 
as he retained the power of amusing them. The 
following letter certainly shows that some of his 
acquaintance were not very refined, and drew his 
sarcastic remarks upon themselves, by their own 
conduct ; it was addressed to an elderly lady with 
whom he was intimate : — 

Tuesday. 



My dear Mrs. 



You desired me to divulge the denouement of a 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. > 53 

recent entretien with Mademoiselle . I will 

endeavour to recollect it in all its pristine purity. 
La Donzella had been asking me who figured at 

Mrs. 's late hop. My answer was that there 

was not any one particularly frappante ; that the 
only novelty I had remarked was a duenna in the 

family of Mr. , who certainly accompanied the 

quadrilles with harmonious hands upon the piano, 
and subsequently danced herself, to the discord of 
others, with the obedient foot of Taglioni ; that the 
absence of attraction from the face and figure of la 
gouvernante in question was partially compensated 
by the accompUshments which she exhibited. Our 
entretien wavered to the briUiancy and comfort of 
General Corbet's fire, and progressively to one of 
my famiUar agremens during the winter nights, an 
earthen bottle clad in a petticoat of flannel contain- 
ing hot water. 

To my amazement and discomfiture she nawement 
asked me, " Would you not prefer being married 
to the governess you have been praising than to the 
bottle in the bed ?'* I found it was high time to 
correct the irregular bearing of this interrogation, 
and I abruptly responded, " The lady in question, 
to whom you so unreservedly return, might indeed 
prove a preferable substitute for the innocent bottle, 
but I have much too good an opinion of her to 



54 THE LIFE OF 

suppose she would entertain such warming-pan 

ideas." The undaunted , instead of fainting, 

as I expected, at the look of deep censure which 
accompanied my remark, exploded into a boisterous 
fit of horse laughter, with screeching turbulence, to 
attract the attention of the whole assemblage ; and 
your humble reporter resorting to a pinch of snuff, 
to conceal his confusion, rose from the profane con- 
ference, and with wounded feelings at the imguarded 
ingenuousness of this Highland hoyden, retired to 
his soUtary chamber, painfully ruminating upon the 
lax moraUty of society.

Cobbet and the parsons at your door. Dr. , 

who a Tinstant is feeling my left pulse, is anxious

my doubts.

To the feWy both French and English, to whom 
he was really partial, particularly those of the beau 
sexe, he was most agreeable ; and Uke many per- 
haps the generality of elderly people, he much pre- 
ferred the society of young persons to that of those of 
his own age. With some of the damosels he would 
assume a protecting air, giving them advice as to little 
niceties in manners and conversation ; his patron- 
izing look at such moments savouring a good deal 
of by-gone days, seemed to say, *' Now that I have 
noticed you, you may take your place in society 
without fear of being criticised." To his extreme 
favourites he would occasionally dispatch a billet 
breathing deep reverence for their many excellent 
qualities ; and this mark of his approbation and 
regard was sometimes accompanied by a drawing of 
his own, and sometimes by one of the various Uttle 
trifles that ornamented his table, or his mantel-piece, 
or reposed in the recesses of his secretaire. 

In this mannef fugitive pieces of his poetry, and a 
few autograph letters of celebrated people he had 
formerly known, were bestowed upon one or two 
ladies with whom he was on the most friendly

terms. With them he also occasionally corre- 
sponded; and his letters to them, and the notes 
already alluded to, pleasingly relieve a biography 
which is entirely devoid of stirring or adventurous 
incident. For those with whom he was, in the 
literal sense of the term, intimate, he had a fund 
of conversational wit, and an inexhaustible store 
of anecdote ever ready. His good stories were 
never repeated, and his desultory reading (for he 
had all the new publications from Paris) rendered 
him as amusing a companion as he had ever been. 
With these friends his reserve gave way: he not 
only conversed with them freely on topics connected 
with his early days, but described most deUghtfully 
all the bright and gay scenes in which he had par- 
ticipated, laughing most heartily at the folly of 
those who had permitted him to exercise such an 
absolute influence over the fashionable world, and 
to which they themselves were slaves.

Though Brummell met with the kindest reception 
at Caen, both from the French and English, and 
soon formed agreeable intimacies with a few of the 
best families of either nation, yet malgre the dinners 
of Mr. Burton and Mr. Villiers, his gay demeanour, 
his sallies, and apparent insoudancey he must have 
been at times exceedingly harassed and annpyed; 
for he had scarcely been six months in the town 
before he was up to his wig in difficulties,. His 
eighty pounds a year, all that he was receiving out 
of his salary of four hundred, was insufficient for 
rent and washing: the latter amounted to eight 
hundred francs, rather more than a third of it ; and 
though this was not extraordinary for a man who 
had lived through life as he had, and invariably 
draped his elegant form in three shirts and three 
neck-cloths per diem, such habits were annihilation

to such an income. Lest any of my readers should 
think me guilty of exaggeration with respect to 
this item of Brummell's weekly expenditure, I will 
here insert what Prince Puckler, in one of his let- 
ters to Julia, calls the weekly statement made by 
the fashionable blanchisseuse that he employed when 
in London, who he asserts was the only person that 
could make cravats of the right stifihess, or fold 
the breasts of shirts with plaits of the right size. 
" An elegant then requires per week twenty shirts, 
twenty-four pocket-handkerchiefs, nine or ten pair 
of summer trowsers, thirty neck-handkerchiefs, 
(unless he wears black ones,) a dozen waistcoats, 
and stockings a discretion.'^ By-the-bye I should 
mention that Brummell told me that he invariably 
went home to change his cravat after the opera, 
previously to attending his other engagements, 
either ball or supper. But independently of his 
large washing bills, he had not yet learned to dress 
himself without the assistance of a valet; and he 
also gave a few dinner parties, so that his annual 
expenses must have amounted to more than eight 
times his income. But he was Consul, he was Beau 
Brummell, and credit was easily obtained. This 
he took advantage of immediately after his arrival, 
and also again applied for assistance to Mr. Leveux.

I have given one of his letters to this gentleman a 
place here only with the view of showing a specimen 
of his knowledge of French. The reader will per- 
haps criticise it in an indulgent spirit, when he 
recollects (for the anecdote has been already given) 
that it is written by one who, in his hopeless endea- 
vours to learn the language, had been stopped '' Uke

A Monsieur Jacques Leveux, 
Banquier, Calais. 

This heroic indiflference to privations he had 
never yet submitted to, and his alarm for his hon- 
our and reputation are somewhat entertaining. 
The tact also is excellent, with which he presents 
Mr. Leveux's interests to his consideration, by- 
way of an argument for advancing his own; it 
was, however, an unsuccessful application, as the 
following extract from another letter to the same 
gentleman, written about a month after, will prove : 
"Je me suis flatt^, mon cher Monsieur, pendant 
un mois, d 'avoir de vos nouvelles. Poussd k la

fin rhabit k mon dos, qui est vdritablement k peu 
pr^, tout ce qui me reste,'* &c., &c. This second 
letter had the desired eflfect, and his bill was 
cashed, but the relief was but temporary, and he 
now began to feel the distress which had hitherto 



62 THE LIFE OF 

presented itself to his mind only in imagination. 
The supplies that he had formerly received from 
his friends, were probably withdrawn, mider the 
feeling that he was provided for; and the hope 
of benefiting by any windfall from an old ac- 
quaintance, was now out of the question. Caen 
was an outlying piquet, and never visited, whereas, 
Calais, being on the high-road between Paris and 
London, was the very place for a mendicant of 
his stamp — ^he there levied a toll on all those 
who had formerly travelled with him along the 
chauss^e of fashionable life. 

Three months after the date of the preceding 
letter, Brummell was in the most abject state of 
dependence, and was reduced to beg and borrow 
of those he would once have held at an immea- 
surable distance. But one of liis own letters shall 
describe his present position: it is addressed to 
Mr, Armstrong, the factotum of the English at 
Caen, who united in his own person the several 
occupations of packet-agent, grocer, and tea-dealer, 
and wine merchant : he also hired houses for his 
countrymen, and cashed their bills, and singularly 
enough, for perhaps he was the only person in the 
world who would have done so, he on this occasion 
cashed one or two of Brummell's, and settled with 
several of his most pressing creditors. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 63 

August, 1831. 

Dear Armstrong, 

I have been reduced to so low an ebb during the 
last three weeks, by delay, and not receiving pro- 
mised remittances from England, that it is impos- 
sible for me to hold up my head, or to exist in 
my actual state a day longer. For ten days I have 
actually not had five francs in my possession, and 
I have not the means of procuring either wood or 
peat, for my scanty fire, or of getting my things 
from the washerwoman. A trifling advance would 
arrange these difficulties, and give me further time, 
but I know not who to apply to in this place. 

You have as yet been a good friend to me, and 
may have sufficient confidence in me, and inclina- 
tion to extend some additional timely service to me. 
What I have already assured you I now repeat, with 
every honourable intention and feeling, you will not 
repent your kindness. 

I have not any thing to offer you by way of 
security, excepting my signature, if it is not my 
small stock of plate, for which I paid six hundred 
jfrancs, and my watch and chain, worth as much 
more : to these you are welcome, only do not let me 
be exposed to the most utter distress and want, 
from my temporary inability to command a few 
miserable francs. I am not going out, and if you 



64 THE LIFB OF 

can. spare five* minutes in the course of the morn- 
ing, you will oblige me by coming down here : 
these matters are better arranged in person than 

by writing. 

Yours, 

G. B. 

But a short time had elapsed after Mr. A. had 
relieved these difficulties when his valet threatened 
to open the trenches of the law against him. He 
had found out that his master was without funds, 
and became impertinent ; but Brummell, like every 
gentleman in similar circumstances, was obliged to 
put up with his insolence till his servant gave him 
warning: this he did not long delay doing, and, 
unreasonable being! actuedly demanded his wages. 
The result was another application to Mr. Arm- 
strong, and his cash-box, in the following charac- 
teristic terms : — 

Dear Armstrong, 

That d — d ungrateful brute, Isidore, persecutes 
me at every instant: the fellow says he is going 
to Paris on Thursday, and will not depart without 
being paid, in money or by bill, and I believe him 
capable of employing a huissier. 

I am wretchedly bedevilled, and out of spirits, and 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 65 

hate going out of the house, or I would call and 
thank you for your note of yesterday. 

Truly yours, 

A Monsieur Armstrong, G. B. 

Rue St. Jean. 

Two bankers, Messrs. Gilbert and Bellamy, fol- 
lowed in the pertinacious Isidore's wake, who was, 
it seems, ungrateful; why, does not appear. By 
renewing bills, by promises, compromises, and 
the assistance of Mr. Armstrong's signature, the 
bankers' demands were staved oflf for a season; 
ready money, however, was absolutely necessary at 
times, to stop the proceedings of some other impor- 
tunate creditor, or to provide for the daily disburse- 
ments of his manage ; and towards the end of the 
year we again find the Beau applying to his Croesus 
of the Rue St. Jean, and once more oflfering his 
plate as security. One of his gold watches, with 
the chain and seals, was already in Mr. Armstrong's 
possession. 

Dear Armstrong, 
r am positively pressed for two hundred and 
eighty francs, at the moment, that is, before four 
o'clock to-day, or I shall be exposed to the ut- 
most disgrace. The things, that is, the plate, are 
in the closet in my room, and you may have them

by sending any confidential person for them ; but 
I do not like to trust my servant with them, as it 
may be known, or she may be seen with them in 
the street. It is the urgency of the moment that 
I am anxious to weather; small difficulties often 
extend to irreparable destruction of character; 
such is my situation at this instant. 

Yours, 

A Monsieur Armstrong, G. B. 

Rue St. Jean. 

These miseries continued uninterrupted till his 
death. Before, however, entering further upon 
them, or describing his external appearsmce or 
daily routine of life, I must, out of respect for 
those who love chronological accuracy, introduce 
here two or three of his letters ; they were written 
in the winter of 1831, and form part of a cor- 
respondence which was kindly placed in my hands 
by a relative of the lady to whom they are ad- 
dressed. These notes are valuable, since they show 
that there was one useful occupation amongst the 
many idle ones in which Brummell's mornings 
were generally consumed ; this was, to teach Made- 
moiselle Aimable, the daughter of his landlady, how 
to write the English language, and to correct the 
themes which she brought home from her master. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 67 

The young lady was about fourteen years of age when 
he undertook to assist her in this branch of her 
education ; and, from the exilogiums which he passes 
upon her diligence, she appears to have profited 
by his tuition. Never having had the pleasure of 
seeing or conversing with his pupil, I am ignorant 
whether he pursued the Lancasterian or Hamil- 
tonian system ; nor have I any reason to suppose 
he adopted the one he advocates in a subsequent 
letter, in which he says, '' I hear that Mademoiselle 
Eugenie is advancing in the knowledge of pure 
Celtic, which they say is always best taught and 
learnt by the eyes !" His young French acquaint- 
ance, though very probably conversant with this 
system, woxild scarcely have acquired a knowledge 
of any language from Brummell's at this period of 
his life, for they were now dim with age and anxiety. 
Indeed, I believe his method consisted simply in an 
exchange of notes, of which the following are spe- 
cimens, or in hearing her read when he visited 
Madame St. Ursain's drawing-room, and copying 
verses for her album. 

November, 1831.

and unprofitable life ; never in bed before the moon

jaded eyes till the morning has almost vanished. I 
am angry with myself, now that this dissipation is 
passed, because it has made me inattentive to our 
correspondence in English. I shall certainly turn 
over a new leaf, and amend the evil course of these 
late hours, if it is only in deference to my pro- 
mise to improve you in the knowledge of my 
uncouth native dialect. You are anxious to learn, 
and you merit every commendation for your assi- 
duity. If you were not influenced by such laud- 
able sohcitude, I am sure you would not volun- 
tarily undertake these constant peregrinations to 
Miss Wheatcroft's,* in such abominable weather, 
for the purpose of conferring in other languages 
than your own with Miss Davidson and Signor 
Matteo;t the former may possess the instructive 
talents of the celebrated Mrs. Trimmer, and for 
your sake I hope she does ; but for the soi-disant 
Signor, I must confess my doubts with regard to 
his capacity to impart either the idiom or the 
accent of the lingua Toscana. Prosecute your studies 
with the same amiable attention and emulation that 
you have already evinced, and you will soon be 
omniscient. I am half asleep ; my ideas are as 
dense and foggy as the morning; and one might

It is in vain I had promised myself a quiet 
evening at home, I am really obsede to attend a 
stupid soiree, and without being guilty of a pal- 
pable untruth, it is impossible for me to send an

sure of writing to you, more diflFiisely, and more 
academically, till to-morrow morning. Good night,

The moment I had begun to write to you yester-

and be assured, my very dear Miss Aimable, that 
one of the most prominent and vexatious of these 
evil spirits is, the compunction of having ne- 
glected my promised duty to write to you : I be-

period — ^The author's costume at fault — Brummell's dress of a morning — 
Secrets of the toilette divxdged — The Beau taking his afternoon walk — His 
hatred to clogs. 

In February, 1832, a few months after these notes 
were written, I went to Caen, and soon after had 
an opportunity of meeting Bmmmell at an evening 
party. The rencontre was a favourable one for re- 
ceiving first impressions of him ; for the lady of the 
house was a kind friend of his, and he was very 
assiduous in making himself agreeable. Little, how- 
ever, did I imagine, at that time, that he ** ruminated 
over the broken toys of past days," appearing, as 
he did, the most light-hearted person in the room. 

Though buried nn India during the preceding six 
years, I had heard, nay read, of Bmmmell, — his 
superlative taste, and unquestionable authority, in all 
** that doth become a man :" but the mysteries of

teens, my round jacket was supplanted by a full- 
dress regimental coat, and my ankle boots, by Wei-

lingtons. Of the perfect contour of a shoestring I 
was, alas ! in utter ignorance, and I had been saved 
all the trouble of overcoming the difficulties of a 
tie, by our Colonel, who, in his very laudable anx- 
iety to preserve strict uniformity in the corps, fitted 
us all with glazed leather stocks, as stifi^ as blinkers, 
which were fastened with brass clasps behind, and 
actually forbid the use of straps to our trowsers. In 
those distant regions, the only Schneider I had ever 
known, was the master-tailor, and though I had 
frequently attended at his shop to see clothes fitted, 
and had verified the positions of pickers and brushes, 
and the precise distance between the knapsack 
straps, on heavy marching-order parades, until a 
foot-rule came as handy to me as to a carpenter, 
I was not much enlightened on the subject of plain 
clothes. As to the length, breadth, or depth of 
whiskers, the only hint I had received was, to shave 
them oflf at right angles with the ear, in other 
words to leave a square inch : any thing approach- 
ing the line of beauty, any thing spherical, besides 
the shot, being considered wholly at variance with 
the spirit of General Regulations, and highly sub- 
versive of military discipline. Poor Euclid ! verily 
thy pages have been practically illustrated in the 
Regiment! to which, nevertheless, in disci- 
pline, the Guards were mere recruits. " Deluded 



74 THE LIFE OF 

man ! " I hear them exclaim ; but so it was, and I 
have no doubt so it is. What marvel, then, that 
with such disadvantages, an awful dread came over 
me, when I thought of the cauterizing that might 
be my fate, on being introduced to this satirical 
epitome of elegance ? 

Despite my ignorance, however, the polished 
ease of his address, and the extreme neatness of 
his person, were so peculiarly striking, that although 

he entered Mrs. B 's drawing-room with several 

other visitors, I immediately selected from the group 
the one who I felt could be no other than the 
exiled Beau. It was quite pleasing to see the grace- 
ful manner in which he made his way through the 
crowded salon up to the lady of the house ; the 
profound bow with which he saluted, appeared to 
be made thus low as a particular tribute to her. 
The presence of his other female friends was duly 
noticed, and I could almost fancy that his bow to 
each was graduated according to the degree of inti- 
macy that existed between them, that to his friends 
being at an angle of forty-five degrees, while a 
common acquaintance was acknowledged by one 
of five; and if this deviation from the perpen- 
dicular was more than requisite, a slight relaxa- 
tion of his features expressed his recognition of 
the fact, that she was an inhabitant of the same 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 



75 



planet as himself. Brummell had all the bel air^ as 
the French call it, of a man of fashion ; his tour- 
nurCj for it must be admitted that men have it as 
well as the other sex, was perfect; and it would 
have been diflSicult indeed to fail in distmguishing 
him from the rest of his party, though by this 
remark I certainly do not mean to infer that those 
who entered the room with him were not gentle- 
men : they were so, and of the best Norman fami- 
Ues in the province. But ancient lineage is not 
always accompanied by elegant manners ; moreover, 
though of the best society in Caen, they were still 
provincials, and had not the courtly air of him 
whose whole life had been devoted to the cultiva- 
tion of external accomplishments, and who had been 
so much in the society of that royal personage who 
was universally considered the most elegant man of 
his day. 

Though I have spoken of Brummell's style of 
dress in his early life, I shall again briefly describe 
it here as it came under my own observation. He 
stood to his Whig colours to the last. His dress on 
the evening in question consisted of a blue coat 
with a velvet collar, and the consular button, a buff 
waistcoat, black trowsers, and boots. It is difficult 
to imagine what could have reconciled him to adopt 
the two latter innovations upon evening costume, 



76 THE LIFE OF 

unless it were the usual apology for such degeneracy 
in modem taste, the altered proportions of his legs. 
Without entering into a description of the exact 
number of wrinkles in his white neck-cloth, I shall 
merely say that his tie was unexceptionable, and that 
his blanchisseuse had evidently done her very best in 
the " getting up,'' as these good bodies term it. I 
may here observe that I never heard the Beau ac- 
cused, as I have some " lions, ^^ of having a tin case 
with a Bramah lock to keep his neckcloths in, folded, 
and free from the unhallowed touch of others, though 
he always gave careful instructions to his washerwo- 
man how she was to fold them ; and his valet assured 
me at Boulogne, with becoming earnestness, that he 
never had a failure, — he always succeeded in his tie. 
They were, however, subjected to the strictest inspec- 
tion, and a speck on one of them, however minute, 
was the warrant for its return to the soapsuds. 

The only articles of jewellery that I observed 
about him were a plain ring, and a massive chain 
of Venetian ducat gold, which served as a guard to 
his watch, and was evidently as much for use as 
ornament. Only two links of it were to be seen, 
those that passed from the buttons of his waistcoat 
to the pocket. The chain was peculiar, and was of 
the same pattern as those suspended in terrorem 
outside the principal entrance to Newgate. The 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 11 

ring was dug up on the Field of the Cloth of Gold 
by a labourer, who sold it to Brummell when he 
was at Calais. An opera hat and gloves, that were 
held in his hand, completed an attire which, being 
remarkably quiet, could never have attracted atten- 
tion on any other person. His mise was peculiar 
only for its extreme neatness, and wholly at variance 
with an opinion that I have already mentioned as 
very prevalent among those who were not personally 
acquainted with him, that he owed his reputation 
to his tailor, or to an exaggerated style of dress. 
He was indeed averse to strong contrasts in colours. 
One evening, subsequent to the one of which I have 
been speaking, when we had become more intimate, 
and the burgundy had helped him forward on the 
road to familiarity, he gently admonished me on 
this subject, and said, *' My dear Jesse, I am sadly 
afraid you have been reading Pelham ; but excuse 
me, you look very much like a magpie.'' I was 
costami in a black coat and trowsers, and white 
waistcoat, and though I had never given that gentle- 
man's adventures a second thought, I considered 
myself at least a grade above a magpie : even at 
this time the Beau was so much upon the qui vive 
on this point, that he remarked every thing in a 
stranger's dress, his very shoestrings not escaping 
criticism. 



78 THE LIFE OF 

In the morning his outward man was equally 
quiet, and never varied ; it consisted of a snuff- 
coloured surtout, with a velvet collar a shade darker, 
and a real cashmere waistcoat, made from a shawl 
which, from the beauty of its quality, must have 
cost a hundred guineas. The ground was white, 
and though the waistcoat had gone through a French 
washerwoman's hands for many winters, it was still 
in as good a state of preservation as himself, partly 
owing perhaps to his coat being invariably buttoned 
up. Dark blue trowsers, very pointed boots, the 
unrivalled white neckcloth, a black hat a little larger 
at the crown than the circumference of his head, 
and primrose kid gloves, completed his attire. In 
summer the cashmere waistcoat was exchanged for. 
a light Valentia one. 

The happy effect of this ensemble was not at- 
tained without considerable difficulty; his batterie 
de toilette was of silver, and complete and elabo- 
rate indeed were its details : — amongst them was 
a silver spitting-dish, of about the same dimen- 
sions as a French wash-hand basin, therefore not 
very large : this was perhaps the one for the use 
of which he humorously accounted, in the days 
of his splendour, by saying, that *' it was impossible 
to spit in clay.'' After his shaving was over, 
two hours were consumed in ablutions that would 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 79 

have gained him a reputation for sanctity in a 
Mahomedan country. In the morning visits that 
I sometimes paid him at his lodgings, the door 
of his bed-room being always left a little open to 
carry on the conversation, the secrets of his dress- 
ing-table were, much to my entertainment, revealed 
in the glass upon the mantel-piece of his salon. 
I think I see him now, standing without his wig, 
in his dressing trowsers, before the glass, going 
through the manual exercise of the flesh-brush, 
in a manner that would have brought tears of 
joy into the eyes of that regenerator of the epi- 
dermis. Colonel R ; when the strigil of pig's 

bristles was laid aside, he looked very much like 
a man in the scarlet-fever, and ready for the cami- 
sole, and a flannel one was accordingly put on. 
All the hard work was now done; but, before 
" robing," the Beau took a dentist's mirror in one 
hand, and a pair of tweezers in the other, and 
thus nobly armed, closely scanned his forehead 
and well-shaved chin, and did not lay them down 
till he had drawn, with a resolution and perse- 
verance truly extraordinary, and totally regardless 
of the exquisite pain the removal of each elegant 
extract must have caused him — every stray hair 
that could be detected on the surface of his vene- 
rable mug! 



80 THE LIFE OF 

Be it remembered, that these farcical details 
were daily repeated when he was upwards of 
fifty years of age, and in the full possession of 
all his faculties ! Had Brummell known that I 
had ever caught a glimpse of him without his 
wig, he would, I think, have had a fit, and cut 
me the next time we met; for he did not Uke 
to be seen to disadvantage and "shorn of his 
beams ;'' but my curiosity, as well as my unwill- 
ingness to lose so amusing an acquaintance, en- 
tirely prevented me from disclosing the event 
to any one. 

Every hair being at last in its right place, 
and his hat a little on one side. Hen gant^^ with 
an umbrella under his arm, his body slightly 
bent, and his tie reflected in his lucent boots, he 
emerged from the porte cochere of the hotel, and 
proceeded, creeping, snail-like, on tiptoe down the 
street, either to make a morning call, or to kill 
the interval till dinner by lounging with an ac- 
quaintance in the Rue St. Jean, the principal 
street of the town. 

When Brummell first arrived in Caen, he was 
in the habit of carrying a cane, but as the baro- 
meter there generally stands at change, and the 
mere probability of rain was alarming to him, he 
very often laid it aside for a brown silk umbrella, 



GEORGE fiRUMMELL. 81 

which was always protected by '^ silk case that 
fitted as accurately as his own coat. The handle 
was surmounted by the head of George the Fourth 
carved in ivory, with well-curled wig and smiling 
graciously. Though not such a splendid speci- 
men of art as Sir Thomas Lawrence's portraits of 
that sovereign, this eflSgy had one decided superi- 
ority over them, it was not flattering; perhaps, 
the more prized by Brummell on that account. 
The umbrella is now in the possession of Mr. 
Armstrong, who has likewise his dressing-case, 
pistols, and other effects. 

In the street, Brummell never took off his hat 
to any one, not even to a lady; it would have 
been difficult to replace it in the same position, 
for it was invariably put on with great care, and at 
a prescribed angle ; added to which, his wig might 
have been disturbed,— a catastrophe too dreadful to 
be wantonly encountered. In fine weather,, the 
salute of his associates was acknowledged by a 
bow, or, if on the other side of the street, by an 
extension of his arm, and a slight movement of 
his fingers in the air. In muddy weather, as there 
were no trottoirs, he was too much occupied with 
his lower extremities to think of noticing anything 
but the unequal paving-stones, on tho liij^hest of 
which he always placed his foot, and. ho laeverly

did he pick his way on the points of his toes, 
that I have seen him travel the whole length of 
the street, without contracting one speck of dirt 
on his boots ; the soles of which, by the bye, he 
always had polished, as well as the upper-leathers. 
But the Beau had an excellent reason for this, to 
ordinary understandings, outrageous caprice: he 
knew the proneness of human nature to neglect its 
duties ; and as, in consequence, he could never feel 
sure that the polish on the edge of the sole would be 
elaborated with the care that he thought indispens- 
able, unless he adopted extreme measures, he endea- 
voured to secure his object by insisting that every 
part of his chaussure should be equally attended to. 
To effect this important end, he conceived the 
idea of giving such a simple order to his shoe- 
black, as he could not have any possible excuse 
for misunderstanding ; especially as he gave him a 
private lesson, by absolutely taking up the black- 
ing-brush, and cleaning one boot in his presence ; 
thus carefully enforcing all his directions by ex- 
ample. 

K I walked with him when the streets were 
muddy, he never failed to desire me to '* keep my 
distance ;" an order that I had so often received on 
parade, that I obeyed mechanically ; and he always 
took this precaution, lest my more careless and 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 83 

assured tread should splash his trowsers or his 
boots. Clogs he despised, and had a perfect abhor- 
rence of them in the day-time, though they were 
almost indispensable, to get in tolerable comfort 
along the execrably dirty streets of this town. At 
night, however, when he could not succeed in get- 
ting a cast in a friend's carriage to a soiree, and his 
ten-sous whist, he would condescend to wear them, 
as they were concealed by the obscurity of the 
evening. There was much of the beau monde phi- 
losophy in this ; theft, in Sparta, was a crime — but 
only when discovered.

Brummell's letters to his female fiiends at Caen— Mrs. Brownrigg the 'prenti- 
cide — ^The prefecture under the Juste Milieu — ^The " soirees " of the

I WILL now pause in my narrative, to introduce 
a little of his gossip on paper, with two or three 
of his female correspondents. The lady to whom 
the following amusing epistle was addressed, had 
been in the East, and on account of ill health 
seldom frequented the gay parties going on in the 
town. The letter requires but little commentary. 
Madame du Lac was, indeed, a perfect Donna del 
Lago, with the sweetest face and most beautiful foot 
in this part of France. The head of the " convo- 
cation" was a military warbler, who gave parties, the 
dulness of which was occasionally relieved by his 
own and other amateur singing, such as one might 
expect to hear in a country town ; and Madame de 
Rigny was the wife of the Minister of Marine's bro- 
ther, who received the taxes, while she received the 
company — ^it was juste milieu.

Thursday, March, 1832. 

• Madame de will be charmee to receive the 

" black Infanta ;" shall I send a palanquin for her, 
or will you pass her en pannier ? Madame du Lac 
tells me, that the artiste for whom you inquired 
perfectly understands his metier, and that his res- 
semblances sont frappantes. I have already forgot- 
ten his name, as one does every thing when talking 
to her, but he sojourns at the H6tel de France. I 
will see him during the present daylight, if there 
is any left ; and, if he goes out to work, he shall 
be with you to-morrow.

apprentices. The crime was committed under circumstances of 
the most atrocious character, indeed such as oblige us to believe 
that Hogarth's illustrations of the ingenuity of <jruelty are not 
exaggerated. In a number of the Gentleman's Magazine for that 
year is a drawing, representing one of the girls naked, with her 
arms fastened by a rope to a staple in the ceiling of the kitchen 
where some of tlie outrages were inflicted ; a full description of 
Mrs. Brownrigg's brutalities accompanies the engraving. Another

I was about to omit, that Madame de Kr- 



will be happy to see you at her approaching 
squeeze, and, if from etiquette you should be 
starch, she will give you a preliminary call — you 
will of course respond, No — through the grating 
of your cellule. Still all the more worldly Bd- 
guines are now numbering their beads for the 
confederate honour a faire le chaperon ^ Made-

My first essay at movement yesterday was my 

contemporary narrative says, that when the girl was discovered,her 
head was swollen to almost double the natural size, and her neck 
so much, that she could not speak nor swallow ; her mouth stood 
open, and the surgeon who examined her deposed, that " she was 
all one wound, from her head to her toes ; that her shift stuck to 
her bodyj that she was in a fever, and the wounds beginning 
to mortify from neglect." It will scarcely be credited, that Mrs. 
Brownrigg was the mother of sixteen children ; in outward ap- 
pearance a very agreeable and amiable person, and was so much 
remarked for skill and tenderness, that she was appointed midwife 
to the workhouse of St. Dunstan's in the West, the inmates of 
which (for she often relieved them) had a great regard for her.

A Madame , 

Rue ■ 

When Brummell arrived at Caen, the French 
society was fast declining from what it had been for 
fifteen years after the Restoration: the employes under 
the elder branch of the Bourbons were men of the 
best famiUes ; and the noblesse being, with very few 
exceptions, of the same pohtical opinions, instead 
of spending their winters at Paris, took up their 
abode at their old hotels in the town. The revolu- 
tion of July overturned the social system of this 
party : and the Prefecture, which had hitherto been 
the rallying point of all the elegants and elegantes of 
the province, was now the rendezvous of a class of 
persons who had never before looked at it in any 
other light than as a public office, which they could 
only expect to enter for the purpose of transacting 
business. 

As they walked in at one door the nobility walked 
out at the other, and retired to their chdteaux in 



88 THE LIFE OF 

the country to talk over legitimacy, to lament the 
degeneracy of modem days, and curse England 
for leaving the French nation to do as they pleased. 
A few of the less rich and influential of this class 
remained, principally dowagers without chdteaux or 
husbands, but having daughters ready to be con- 
fided to the professional discretion of whatever 
avocat could make a convenable contrat with any of 
the young men of the party who still hngered in the 
town. These remnants constituted the cream of 
French society in Caen : dinner parties were of rare 
occurrence, but the evening receptions were fre- 
quent, and, as in other parts of the Continent, of 
weekly occurrence during the winter season. At 
such reunions the visitors deposited the price of the 
cards under the candlesticks, and after sipping a 
glass of orgeat or eau siicree and losing a certain 
number of ten-sous pieces at whist, or five francs at 
ecarte, retired to their homes at eleven as punctually 
as they had arrived at seven. At one or two houses 
the play was not carried on with so much modera- 
tion ; large sums were lost at bouillotte and ecarte^ 
and the losers would sit till three o'clock in spite of 
their bad luck, and the entreaties of the lady of the 
house to be allowed to go to bed at twelve. 

After the annihilation of his official responsibi- 
lities, Brummell cut the tradesmen at the Prefecture, 



GEORGE fiRUMMELL. 89 

to which he had never gone but from a strong sense 
of pubUc duty and an occasional dinner : he also 
quietly, but courteously, retired from the houses 
of nearly all the public officers of the government, 
and from henceforth affected to treat their preten- 
sions very lightly. With the exception of two or 
three English families, he now lived entirely with 
the legitimists, the observances and etiquette of 
whose salons were much more in keeping with 
his early associations than those practised in the 
houses of the juste milieu ; not that he cared a sous 
for the politics of either party, but he preferred 
the manners of the former, and found their strops 
and their orgeats no worse than those of their oppo- 
nents. Louis-Philippe, whose conduct he had 
lauded at the public dinner to which he was invited 
by the pr^fet on his arrival, when he '* let off a neat 
httle extempore speech to the commercial success 
of the two nations," was now in his eyes a parvenu^ 
his supporters of course the same ; and, in his new 
character of a zealous Carlist, he thought it neces- 
sary to refuse an invitation to a ball given by the au- 
thorities in honour of the new sovereign, as he passed 
through on his way to Cherbourg. The fact was, a 
dinner was given also, to which he was not invited, 
possibly the real reason for his declining to attend 
the ball. The day after this fSte one of his acquaint- 



90 THE LIFE OF 

ance, who happened to meet him in the street, in- 
quired whether he had been to the ball given in 
honour of the king the night before. ** What king ?" 
inquired Brummell, in a tone of feigned surprise 
and inquiry. " The French king, to be sure ; 
Louis-Philippe." '*0h! the Duke of Orleans, you 
mean ; no, I did not go, but I sent my servant/' 

The convocations and conversaziones were va- 
ried until Careme set its seal of starvation and 
penance upon winter gaieties by a few soirees dan- 
santeSy at which both old and young took exercise, 
though I will not libel the Beau by saying that he 
ever distinguished himself in this way : but of the 
balls I shall have occasion to speak hereafter, and 
will dismiss the evening parties by merely adding, 
that Brummell's manners and devotion to five-sous 
whist won him a few francs, and the unqualified 
admiration of all the women whose confirmed rheu- 
matism prevented them from dancing, and who still 
speak of his courtly air with rapture ; but whether 
ancient or juvenile, French or English, he had the 
tact to select the most spirituelle of the sex for his 
intimates ; and the one to whom the following 
note was written certainly possessed a more than 
ordinary share of wit and accomplishments.

It is not surprising that after such a solemn asse- 
veration, the lady found courage to trust him with 
a fair copy of her verses ; and, as they are amus- 
ing, I give them a place here.

A duster, a bill, a penknife, a whip ; 
A box with no lid, and some sugar for Gyp ;♦ 
An almanac, pencil-case, seals, and blue wax, 
A glass box for bonbons with five or six cracks ; 
Some needles for darning, curl-papers, and sand ; 
The galope of " Gustave, " a bodkin, and band : 
All this, and much more, with my own eyes I saw, 
Taken out of a tidy and fair lady's drawer ! 

This confidence was not thrown away ; it appears 
to have inveigled Brummell into a promise to send 
his correspondent a sketch in return, which was 
accompanied by an explanatory note, and some 
stanzas of Lady Granville's. 

Monday. 

I am ashamed to send you so unworthy a sketch 
of a beautiful woman ; it is the rough outline from 
a portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds of Georgiana 
Duchess of Devonshire ; — the miniature, which I 
afterwards finished, was given to Lady Harriet 
Cavendish, now Lady Granville. 

Do not unjustly fancy that you are for a moment 
forgotten, because I do not immediately remit to 
you my relics of past times in writing, or en 
crayon. 

You shall have others as I go on, unwillingly 
digging in old green boxes : in the meantime I send 
you some lines of Lady Granville's, which I am sure

you will admire. The sua shines bright, and pro- 
mises me the consolation of meeting you in your 
morning's whereabouts. 

Yours, for ever and ever. Amen ! 

A Madame , G. B. 

Rue . 

Before I determined to publish these pleasing lines, 
I wrote to Lord Granville to request his permission 
to do so ; but not having received any reply to my 
letter, I presume that from their being so perfectly 
harmless his Lordship thought it unnecessary to 
send one. I have therefore acted upon the con- 
structive consent that silence always gives. These 
stanzas are not unworthy of the daughter of Geor- 
giana. Duchess of Devonshire; and as her Grace 
died in 1806, and her Ladyship was born in 1785, 
they must, from the tenor of the last line, have been 
written before she had attained her twenty-first 

year. 

THE VOICE OF PRAISE. 

Countess of Granville, 
There is a voice of magic power, 

To charm the old, delight the young, 
In lordly hall, in rustic bower, 
In every clime, in every tongue ; 
However its sweet vibration rung, 
In whispers low, in poets' lays, 

There is not one who has not hung 
Enraptured, on the Voice of Praise. 



94 THE LIFE OF 

The timid child, at that soft voice 
Lifts for a moment's space the eye ; 

It hids the fluttering heart rejoice, 
And stays the step prepared to fly : 
'Tis pleasure hreathes that short quick sigh, 

And flushes o'er that rosy face ; 
"Whilst shame and infant modesty 

Shrink hack with hesitating grace. 

The lovely maiden's dimpled cheek 

At that sweet voice still deeper glows ; 
Her quivering lips in vain would seek 

To hide the hliss her eyes disclose ; 

The charm her sweet confusion shows 
Oft springs from some low hroken word ; 

O Praise ! to her how sweetly flows 
Thine accent, from the loved one heard ! 

The hero, when a people's voice 

Proclaims their idol- victor near. 
Feels he not then his soul rejoice, 

Their shouts of love, of praise to hear ? 

Yes, fame to generous minds is dear. 
It pierces to their inmost core ; 

He weeps, who never shed a tear, 
He trembles, who ne'er shook before. 

'T is sweet to watch affection's eye. 

To mark the tear with love replete ; 
To feel the softly-breathing sigh. 

When friendship's lips the tones repeat ; 

But, oh ! a thousand times more sweet 
The praise of those we love to hear ! 

Like balmy showers in summer's heat. 
It falls upon the greedy ear. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 95 

The lover lulls his rankling wound, 

By hanging on his fair-one*s name ! 
The mother listens for the sound 

Of her young warrior's growing fame ; 

Thy voice can soothe the mourning dame. 
Of her soul's wedded partner riven, 

Who cherishes the hallow'd flame, 
Parted on earth, to meet in heaven ! 

That voice can quiet passion's mood, 

Can humble merit raise on high ; 
And from the wise, and from the good. 

It breathes of immortality ! 

There is a lip, there is an eye, 
Where most I love to see it shine ; 

To hear it speak, to feel it sigh. 
My Mother! need I say 'tis thine ? 

The allusion which Brummell makes in the pre- 
ceding note to the miniature, confirms an anecdote 
that I heard of him when he was visiting at Tick- 
sell Hall, at that time the residence of Lord 
Granville. One day, Mr. Lister, of Armytage Park, 
who lived in the neighbourhood, a great book- 
worm, whose library was his world, was asked to 
dine there, and during the generally stupid half- 
hour which precedes that repast, some of Brum- 
mell's drawings were handed about amongst the 
company, while he was quietly engaged in conver- 
sation in some distant part of the room. At last 
the dinner was announced, and the Beau rose to 



96 THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 

offer his arm to a lady of high rank, his intimate 
friend, as did also Mr. Lister to the same lady; 
but observing the old gentleman's intentions, he 
immediately withdrew: when Mr. L. mistaking 
him for an artist, said, to the infinite amusement 
of the lady, " I 'm glad to see the young man 
understands his place ;" and it was only towards 
the close of dinner, that he discovered who the 
modest young man really was. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

Lines addressed by Bmrnmell to Lady Tankerville — A soiled note— How it 
became so — Causes that led to the abolition of the Consulate — Lord Pal- 
merston — The Consular duties — Brummell called upon officially to settle 
a fimily quarrel — ^The Lion and the Unicom taken down — The impatient 
Restaurateur — Mr. Armstrong sent as " Charg^ d' Affaires" to England in 
search of funds — Extract from a letter advising this measure. 

These lines of Lady Granville's were followed, a few 
days after, by some which Brummell had in 1806 
addressed to the present Countess of Tankerville ; 
they are taken from the Pleasures of Memory, 
which little plagiarism he did not at this time think 
it necessary to acknowledge, whatever he may have 
done when he presented them to her Ladyship. 
They were intended by Brummell, to illustrate a 
romantic incident in Lady Tankerville's life ; and 
this he further explains in the following paragraph, 
taken from the note that accompanied them. 

" You must know, my dear Miss , that Sophie 

de Grammont had, by the command of her father 
the Duke, been destined to take the veil, and had 
already commenced her noviciate, when she es- 
caped from France, with the assistance of her

mother, who fled with her to England. Here the 
noble fugitives were kindly received and protected 
by the beautiful and enthusiastic Duchess of 
Devonshire, and the graceful novice afterwards 
became Lady Ossulston. Her marriage, however, 
is said to have been much opposed by the Earl 
of Tankerville, and the ceremony was put off 
twice — even after the trousseau was ready and 
the day fixed. But the young couple were des- 
perately in love, and the Devonshire family took 
great interest in their protdg^e, as their generous 
natures had prompted them to do in the fate of 
many more. The marriage took place at Devon- 
shire House." 

THE NUN. 
To CoRisANDE Armandine Leonicb Sophie deGrammont. 

The beauteous maid that bids the world adieu, 
Oft of that world will snatch a fond review ; 
Oft at the shrine neglect her beads to trace, 
Some social scene, some dear familiar face, 
Forgot, when first a father's stern control 
Chased the gay visions of her opening soul ; 
And ere with iron tongue the Vesper bell 
Burst through the cypress -walk, the convent-cell, 
Oft will her warm and wayward heart revive, 
To love and joy still tremblingly alive. 
The whisper*d vow, the chaste caress prolong, 
Weave the light dance and swell the choral song ; 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 99 

With rapt ear drink the enchanting serenade, 
And, as it melts along the moonlight glade, 
To each soft note return as soft a sigh, 
And bless the youth that bids her slumbers fly ! 



Though Brummell was himself the Mercury 
who carried this sentimental effusion to the lady's 
habitation, it met with a horrible disaster on its 
brief transit from the porter's lodge to her drawing- 
room, which it seems she mischievously brought 
to his notice in her reply, and thus elicited 
from him the following earnest explanation and 
defence. 

Thursday. 

Do, in compassion to my inveterate proprete\ send 
back the sullied envelope that contained my last 
packet, and accept this explanatory billet. No such 
impure contagion as grease ever came from me. 
The gloves, too, which delivered it, were, spick and 
span, devoted to a cordial compression from the 

heated hand of the corpulent Madame de ; 

but, alas! it must have visited your kitchen, and 
that explains the blemish : yet, I give you my word, 
I took no Uberties avec la cuisiniere.

In the next note he expressed a most sensitive 
anxiety about one of his billets to the same lady, 
who was too unwell to receive morning visitors, for 
the phraseology of which he was desirous of apolo- 
gising; and he gives an excellent reason why he 
might not, when he wrote it, have been capable of 
inditing such a specimen of studied elegance as his 
epistolary communications generally were. 

May, 1832. 

At the moment of returning a book to you yes- 
terday, I have some vague recollection of having 
written a note, and it was probably in that inflated 
style which indicates the aberration of common 
sense. Since daybreak I had been answering an 
unpleasant letter from England, received the night 
before, and, by the unblemished honour of good 
faith and sincere friendship to you, I am almost 
insensible of any delinquencies that may have de- 
graded the tenor of my precipitate morning's address. 
I cannot say more to conciliate your never-failing 
absolution of errors. 

A mandate of mercy arrives to me as I was about 
to envelope my jeremiades. I see you are only blind 
to the faults of others. It dehghts me to find that 
you can still write with secular gaiety, and I enter- 
tain sanguine hopes of your worldly salvation. If I 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 101 

am not allowed soon to visit you, I shall petition 
for an ordonnance from his Holiness. I congratu- 
late you upon the treachery of the report of • 

Menials are strangely addicted to flippant responses 
when interrogated about their superiors. DeWchef 
well-being and resurrection to you. 

Most sensibly yours, 

A Madame , G. B. 

Rue . 

The Enghsh letter to which Brummell here 
alludes may possibly have been a private one from 

Lord P n, announcing the suppression of his 

appointment ; for fourteen days after, it was officially 
announced that the consulate was abolished. There 
are two versions of the reasons that led to this 
*^ untoward event." The first is, that his Lordship, 
with that prophetic spirit so eminently useful as a 
ministerial qualification, foresaw the dreadful drain 
upon the Exchequer that would be created by 
carrying the British arms into central Asia, and 
into the region of tea-caddies and chop-sticks — 
foresaw, I say, the deficit, and the consequent ne- 
cessity for retrenchment, and poor Brummell was 
sacrificed to his friend's Affghan policy. Written 
to officially by the Government, to inquire whether 
there was, or was not, any necessity for a consulate 



102 THE LIFE OF 

at Caen ? he replied in the negative, and informed 
the Foreign Office that a vice could do the little 
there was to be done. In signing such a death- 
warrant, he, no doubt, calculated on the gratitude 
of the noble Secretary on whom he had so fre- 
quently, in former days, permitted his shadow to 
repose ; and yet, how Brummell could expect any 
good from a man who could retrench, must remain 
a mystery to posterity. His expectations, however, 
of receiving either a pension or another situation, if 
such he entertained, were never fulfilled. 

The second version of this affair is, that he volun- 
teered his information, and complained that he had 
nothing to do ; hoping that he might get a better 
appointment, or one in Italy as good, to which 
country he was most anxious to go. Though no 
official record to this effect is to be found in the 
letter-book of the consulate at Caen, he is known 
to have acknowledged having written a letter in this 

spirit to Lord P n; but he declared that he 

never expected it would have been made use of as 
a public document. He really must have been crazy 
to have entertained such an idea ; and, crippled as 
he was in his finances, it is not at all probable that 
he would have given up a certainty for an uncer- 
tainty ; or that he intended his note to have been the 
means of his own ruin. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 103 

Several months after the preceding page was 
written, I received the following account of a con- 
versation that took place between Brummell and 
one of his friends on this subject : my correspon- 
dent was at Caen at the time, and knew him 
intimately. " Brummell," observes this gentleman, 

** told me that his communication to Lord P- n 

was voluntary on his part, and was inspired by his 
desire to obtain Mr. Gordon's situation at H^vre, or 
the consulship of Leghorn. In both of these he 
failed, and thus fell a sacrifice to his disinterested 
amor patrite. He also read me an extract from his 

letter to Lord P n, which I remember verbatim : 

it was as follows : * Your Lordship must be aware 
that by informing the Government of the inutility 
of a consul at Caen, I am actuated by purely disin- 
terested motives. Your Lordship will also bear in 
mind that my bread depends upon the trifling emo- 
luments which I receive as consul at Caen. Should 
your Lordship, therefore, on my suggestion, think 
fit to abolish the office, I trust some means of sub- 
sistence will be provided for me by the Govern- 
ment." Lord P n thanked Brummell for the 

information, abolished the consulate, made great 
promises, and left the poor Beau to expire ** a dri- 
veller and a show ;" something between 
" A moping idiot and a madman gay." 



104 THE LIFE OF 

Brummell certainly told the truth, when he said 
there was nothing for him to do ; his vice did 
everything ; he merely signed. 

I believe nearly the only time that he was called 
upon to exert his consular authority, was, when a 
lady came to him to request that he would restrain 
her son-in-law from beating her daughter, and 
running off with her furniture. Brummell, how- 
ever, was not at all disposed to offer her pro- 
tection, or even a chair; for, being in the midst 
of his toilette, nay, I beUeve, en chemise^ he refused 
to see her, and opened a parley with her in the 
passage, exclaiming loudly through the door of his 
room, against the supposition that interference on 
such a subject formed any part of his duty. Call 
to-morrow, madam, call to-morrow," said Brum- 
mell, **I will consult my chancellor;*' and the 
applicant left, extremely irate. But the street-door 
had scarcely closed upon her, when he gave orders 
to the gervant to be sure that he never allowed 
her to enter the house again. The best part of 
the story is, that Brummell, in his official capacity, 
had married this couple in his drawing-room three 
months before. 

But whether he was led into giving the informa- 
tion respecting the consulate, through an official 
application from his superiors, or whether it was 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 105 

his own voluntary act, is of little consequence : in 
either case it was a miserable piece of economy on 
the part of the Government, his friends; for a 
few years only, and his death would have relieved 
the country from the cost of maintaining him, and 
themselves from the odium, had there been any, 
attached to their preserving an old and infirm man 
from the irretrievable wretchedness into which the 
measure plunged him. They did indeed offer him 
another appointment, but at the same time recom- 
mended him to refuse it, as will be seen in a subse- 
quent letter. He left Calais, upon the strength of 
the consulate being a permanent appointment ; and 
it was most cruel to deceive a man at his time of 
life, and place him in a worse pecuniary position 
than he was before. Caen, as I have already ob- 
served, was not so good a beat as Calais, for a 
fashionable pauper ; by accepting the situation, 
he had got heavily into debt at both places > 
and by its abolishment he was literally thrown 
upon the charity of former friends, without a far- 
thing in his pocket, and in a decidedly worse plight 
than he was previously to their having interested 
themselves in procuring it for him. 

Directly it was reported in the town that Brummell 
was no longer his Britannic Majesty's representative, 
his creditors, who would scarcely believe it possi- 



106 THE LIFE OF 

ble, flocked to the hotel of Madame Guernon de 
St. Ursain, to see whether the lion and the unicorn 
wore still there "fighting for the crown.** Alas! 
the royal emblems, resplendent with vermilion and 
fcilding, graced no more the Beau's doorway : they 
NVtMt) indeed gone; and, in the agony of the mo- 
ment, his creditors fancied that their ecus were gone 
with them. He had been badly enough off before 
tills blow came upon him ; but having lost his 
»upi>orters, his credit went with them, and he was 
l>e8et on all sides. 

Amongst the foremost of his tormentors was a 
Monsieur Longuet, the Ude of Caen, who had a 
rhum upon him for twelve hundred francs. This 
man not only vowed that he would have him 
arivsted if he was seen in the street, but, that in 
ouse he kept the house, he would starve him into 
leaving it, by stopping his miserable rechauffes. 
The siege, however, was raised, by a corps of young 
Frenchmen, Monsieur de Casserole's best customers, 
who, going immediately to his shop, informed 
him, that, if he attempted to molest his unfortu- 
nate debtor, they would never dine at his house 
again. But matters got worse and worse, his health 
indifferent, and he was soon without a franc in his 
pocket — as these few lines will show.

Wednesday. 

Dear Armstrong, 

Send me seventy-five francs to pay my washer- 
woman ; I cannot get a shirt from her, and she is 
really starving on my account. I have not actually 
money to pay my physician, or for my letters to 

and from England. 

Yours, 

A Monsieur Armstrong, G. B. 

Rue St. Jean. 

In the autumn of 1832 his distress became so 
urgent, that nothing was left to be done but to 
send Mr. Armstrong to England ; for he very justly 
conceived that the representation of his embarrass- 
ments would be more fully impressed upon his 
friends by the viva voce statement of a man of busi- 
ness, who was himself a large creditor, than by any 
letters of his own. He was probably encouraged to 
adopt this plan by the following passage in a letter 
from a friend received at this period. 

" I really think that a personal interview of Mr. 
Armstrong with the persons you have named would 
do more good than letters. The difficulty of doing 
so would be great, but all that I can do to insure 
his seeing them I will. I don't know how to get 
at the Duke of WelUngton or Lord Willoughby. I

will write to George Anson and his brother Litch- 
field, Bagot, Alvanley, and many others that may 
occur to me, who I may think can be of any use ; 
and among them, by the way, old Allen, who, I 
assure you, spoke of you the other day in the kind- 
est manner, and I tried hard to get a pony out of 
Coventry for you when I was in town. Worcester, 
I fear, is still ill in the country, otherwise I am sure 
he would have been more ready to exert himself 
than any one."

to crown his misfortunes, taken suddenly ill. The 
symptoms first manifested thepaselves while he was 
inditing the following letter to the daughter of his 
landlady. 

Sunday evening. 

Oh this uncomfortable weather ! I am freezing 
au coin de mon feUy and my ideas are as much con- 
gealed as my limbs. You must not, then, in common 
compassion, expect either amusement or instruction 
from a malheureux in my torpid state. There are 
moments too when I am subject to that sort of 
overwhelming depression of spirits that makes me 
incapable of any thing but to brood over my own 
grievances, fancied or intrinsic, it does not signify. 



110 THE LIFE OF 

I cannot shake off its gloomy influence. I should Uke 
to retire to my bed, and, if "it was possible, to sleep 
till the spring, or till nature would beneficently ani- 
mate my dejected thoughts as she regenerates the 
leaves and flowers of the earth. I am at the instant 
subdued by chillness and blue devils, and feel as 
if I was in my grave, forsaken and forgotten by 
all those who were once most dear to me. *' Le 
plus grand des malheurs est celui de ne tenir ct rien, et

Here poor Brummell's pen dropped from his 
hand; paralysis had seized him, and he was en- 
deavouring to rise from his chair to call for assist- 
ance, when the servant most fortunately came into 
the room. A medical man was quickly in attend- 
ance, and bleeding and blistering were immediately 
resorted to. The fit was a very severe one, the 
whole of his face being afiected by it, especially 
the right side, and also his speech ; but he ima- 
gined it was a severe attack of rheumatism to

which he was subject, and he was at one time in 
such a precarious state, that it was not thought 
advisable to undeceive him. The following note, 
written as soon as he could make use of his pen, 
proves, that some of his friends of the gentler sex 
were anxious about him, and sympathized with 
his sufferings. 

Thursday. 

Mrs. , on her own part, and that of , 

wrote on Monday evening, to request Madame

state; this has only this morning been commu- 
nicated to me. It has, Uke all kindness, most sen- 
sibly affected me; and I will humbly solicit you 
to impart to , and , my sincere grati- 
tude for their flattering interest towards me. 

I have risen to-day with my head perfectly 
quiet, my chest, and all its vicinity composed, 
and free from that oppression and those excru- 
ciating spasms, which I thought, and at one time 
sacrilegiously prayed, would put an end to my 
sufferings in this world. Once more, thanks to 
Heaven and a constitution still unshaken, I am 
returned to my senses and at peace. 

Yours sincerely,

112 THE LIFE OF 

But whatever might have been the extent of his 
mental suflTerings, in the privacy of his own room, 
neither illness, nor the hopeless state of his affairs, 
had yet so lowered his strength and spirits, as to 
allow him to bfetray his anxieties to the world : in 
society, he was as ready as ever with his joke, and 
full of fun and good humour. Shortly after tliis 
attack, and while Mr. Armstrong was in England, 
a French wedding was solemnized, and the marriage, 
singularly enough in France, was entirely one of 
inclination — really a love-match. Brummell was 
invited to assist at the fSte, and, a few days, cer- 
tainly not a week, after the happy event had taken 
place, an acquaintance met him in the street, and 
asked him whether he had heard any thing of the 
nouveaux maries ? **No," said the Beau, ''but I 
believe they are still living together." On the 
return of his ambassador with the subscriptions, his 
creditors were paid, for Mr. Armstrong's visit to 
Brummell's former friends was attended with the 
very best results : every one of the gentlemen men- 
tioned by his friend in a note already given, came 
forward in the most generous manner to his assist- 
ance. To their names should be added those of 
Lord Burlington, who contributed the sum of fifty 
pounds ; Lord Pembroke, Mr. C. Greville, and Mr. 
Standish, also subscribed. One of Brummell's 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 113 

heaviest creditors was the lady of the house in 
which he had for the last two years resided ; for, 
with the exception of the sum of six hundred 
francs, Madame de St. Ursain had never received 
one louis during the whole of that period. Though 
this unconscionable delay must have been extremely 
inconvenient to her, it did not in any way interfere 
to lessen the friendly terms on which they lived : 
nothing could be more kind than her conduct to 
Brummell at all times ; and in the paralytic seizure 
by which he was attacked before he left her house, 
he was nursed with as much care and attention as if 
he had been surrounded by the members of his own 
family. For many a good turn was her lodger 
indebted to her; and perhaps the most essential 
piece of service she ever rendered him was per- 
formed not long before the consulate was abolished, 
when, having heard that bailiffs were at the door, 
who threatened to make an irruption into his apart- 
ments, she hurried him up into a spare room, and 
shut him up in her garde-robe : nay, she was even 
polite enough, as a last alternative, to offer him the 
sanctuary of her bed-room, — ^into which, by the 
laws of France, the officers of justice had no right 
to intrude. On this nervous occasion Brummell's 
presence of mind did not forsake him, and Madame 
had scarcely stowed him away, amongst the sus-

pended dresses, flounces, and ftirbelows, and locked 
the door, than she heard him screaming, in a voice 
deadened by the forest of habiliments, " Madame 
de St. Ursain, de grdce prenez la clef! " 

Brummell had too much tact not to ingratiate 
himself with one who had it in her power to be of 
so much use to him ; and he found little difficulty 
in doing this, for she was an excellent companion, 
extremely well read, and had nearly as much esprit 
de salon as himself. Legitimiste au fond de Vdme^ 
and her relative a prisoner in the fortress of Ham, 
it was not singular that she should detest every 
one, and every thing, connected with the revolution 
of July. Brummell soon gained her good opinion^ 
by showing great consideration for her feelings on 
this subject ; and though he was, in his official 
capacity, called upon to illuminate and to display 
the flag of his own nation, on the anniversaries 
celebrated by the new regimcy he refrained from 
hoisting the union-jack at his own window, and 
placed it a little lower down the street, at a house 
rented by his *' chancellor," Hayter, for a bureau. 
Though Madame could not get paid, she occasion- 
ally turned the Beau to account ; and being anxious 
to obtain some information from the late Duke of 
Sussex, she prevailed upon Brummell to write to 
him on the subject. He promised to do so, but so

\ 

many weeks passed without farther allusion to the 
circumstance, that the lady at length fancied he had 
not written ; or, if he had, that the Duke was dis- 
inclined to send a reply ; she was therefore rather 
surprised when the Beau presented her with the 
following letter : — 

Holkham, April 19th, 1832. 

Dear Sir, 
A period of twenty-two or twenty-three years 
having elapsed since the circumstances to which 
you allude took place, I cannot state facts so cor- 
rectly as I might have done then. A person, of the 

name of Count , was introduced to me at Mr. 

's, by , with whom I was acquainted. In 

consequence of this presentation, a communication 
took place between us, and after some time, by vir- 
tue of the Alien Act, he was removed out of the 
country, and went to Portugal, afterwards to Spain, 
when I totally lost sight of him. I never knew him 
to be a Spanish grandee : indeed, though naturally 
clever, he was a man of no education, and could 
not write. He took me in at that period, as he did 
many others ; and I bought my experience at no 
less a price than from eleven to twelve thousand 
pounds: however, the circumstances occurred so 
long ago, that I have forgotten much of what took 
place at the time, and consider myself fortunate in

having lost sight of him. He certainly did live for 

a time in street, previous to his removal from 

the country. I have written these lines to answer 
your inquiries only, as every thing that took place at 
that time was in consequence of the French revolu- 
tion, and connected with it. I understood him to 
have come from Italy, where he had connexions ; 
however, as Psaid before, he took the road to Por- 
tugal and Spain, when sent out of England by the 
Government of the day. 

I am, dear Sir, with consideration,

It is not necessary to explain the subject of 
this letter; it has been inserted here merely as 
a trait of good nature on the part of his Royal 
Highness, for, to judge by the handwriting, it would 
appear to have been penned with difficulty and 
exertion. When the Beau vacated his apartments 
in the Rue des Carmes, a step which he was very 
loth to take, for he knew that he was much 
more comfortable there than he was ever likely 
to be at the H6tel d'Angleterre, his treacherous 
memory failed to remind him of all Madame de St. 
Ursain's kindness to him ; the nursing, the friendly 



G£0R6£ BRUMMELL. 117 

shelter of her wardrobe, the Angola cats, and the 
parrots — all were forgotten, and he actually left 
her house without taking leave, though to gain 
the street he was obliged to pass the door of 
her drawing-room. *' C'^tait un original que ce 
monsieur,'* said this lady to me, ** but I confess 
to you, that I was mortified at such egotism ; 
however, I took no notice of it. Six months 
after, to my great astonishment, he knocked at 
my door, and entered the salon as if he had seen me 
only the day before: my reception, however, was 
not very flattering, for I considered that he had not 
only been ungrateful, but guilty of a great piece 
of rudeness, une impolitesse. On my tilling him 
this, he appeared greatly distressed, and I was won- 
dering how he would get out of the scrape, when 
he rose from his chair, and taking my hand, said 
with great emotion, * Madame de Saint Ursain, I 
would willingly have wished you good b'ye, but 
I was in tears.' " He did not, however, forget his 
young friend her daughter, to whom, after his de- 
parture, he sent the following letter, which leaves 
room for regret that he did not more often apply 
his mind to subjects of a serious character; as 
it is evident that, when he was excited to notice 
them, he possessed a latent sound sense, and 
force of expression, for which no one is likely to 
give him credit. The spirit of his remarks is not

during the last four days with letters upon business ; 
irksome, indeed, to indite, but which admitted of 
no delay. So, mistaken Miss Aimable, do not 
unjustly reproach me with negligence or forget- 
fulness. 

This cold morning has almost deprived me of 
the use of my fingers as well as of my faculties ; 
therefore, in commiseration, you must not expect 
a prolonged epistle from me. You are cer- 
tainly severe, but incorrect, in your conjecture 
that the destruction by lightning of the tower 
at Harfleur, was a judgment of Providence against 
the English heretics who built it. Pardon me, 
but you betray a little anachronism in your ideas ; 
at the period at which this tower was constructed 
by the English, their religion, if they professed 
any, was universally of the Catholic faith. Martin 
Luther and Calvin did not appear till more than 
a century afterwards, to preach and promulgate 
those rational Protestant doctrines and precepts 
that have since been so deservedly estimated and 
followed, in England, in the Low Countries, 
and in a considerable part of Germany. Would 
it not be less partial to your own countrymen, 
and more morally probable, to suppose that this 
summary infliction from above against the innocent 
tower, indicated the wrath of Heaven against 



120 THE LIFE OF OEOR6E BRUMMELL. 

those modern, insidious, Jesuitical, and intolerant 
Catholic priests, whose pernicious influence and 
profane buflfoonery exasperated the whole nation, 
and efiected the downfal of the unfortunate Bour- 
bon dynasty ? The same perdition, an age and a 
quarter since, fell upon the last of the reigning 
Stuarts in England, because, against the general 
will and remonstrance of the country, he chose 
to be perverse in the mockery and treachery of 
Catholicism. 

But enough of religion ; my fire is extinguished, 
because I have paid more attention to you and my 
plumey than to the tongs, and I am freezing. The 
best faith, I believe, in this weather, is that of the 
poor Laplander, who adores the sun alone — when 
he sees it. 

Very sincerely yours.

Brummell left Madame de St. Ursain's in Sep- 
tember, 1832, and established himself au troi- 
siemey at the H6tel d'Angleterre ; he was there en 
pensiouy dining at the table-d'h6te, and breakfasting 
in his room. After settling himself in his new 
abode, the tranquillity of mind produced by his 
being relieved from daily persecutions of a pecu- 
niary nature, enabled him to regain his strength, 
and for some months he led a tolerably comfort- 
able, but not a very animated life. In the summer 
of 1833, his correspondents, like every one else 
who could leave the town, were at the sea-side or 
their country-houses ; but he, from want of funds, 
could not follow them, and was therefore obliged to 
spend that season in wandering about the deserted 
Cours, without meeting any one on whom to bestow 
an epigram, or a glance of recognition. 



122 THE LIFE OF 

The consequence of this was, that his gossiping 
notes to his friends became letters, and writing 
them appears to have been his chief recreation. 
In one of these to a young favourite, with whose 
family he was extremely intimate, he, in a mood 
half serious, half jocular, made a declaration of love ; 
and I think that my fair readers will admit that, as 
a specimen of sexagenarian feeling in these matters, 
this very humorous composition stands unrivalled. 

• ' ' ',- Tuesday, July. 

Millions of thanks to you for Ayesha. I have 
not quite finished with her ; for I cannot now read, 
nor write, nor do anything in a methodical way ; 
therefore I return her to you, with every expres- 
sion of admiration for your mutual excellences ; 
with Ayesha, indeed, I have only made a transitory 
acquaintance, — you I know already by heart. 

Why, in the name of common prudence smd 
my own tranquillity, could I not have been con- 
tented to restrict my knowledge of you to the 
worldly etiquette of taking off my hat to you, 
when we casually met? During those years that 
I have vegetated upon the barren moor of my later 
life, I have sedulously avoided running my crazy 
head into what may be termed, inconsequent dis- 
tractions ; and now, in spite of all my theoretical 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 123 

circumspection and security, I find myself over 
head and ears, heart and soul, in love with you. 
I cannot, for the life of me, help telling you so ; 
but, as all considerate reason has not at times 
utterly abandoned me, I shall put myself into a 
strait waistcoat, and be chained to the bed-post. 

Perhaps, after having undergone such compul- 
satory infliction, and the bereavement of at least 
half the blood in my veins, I may be restored to 
my more cool and sedate senses. I shall then turn 
Anchorite, and flee away to the desert. Adieu! 
I have yet sufficient command over my drooping 
faculties to restrain any tributary tears from falling 
over my farewell ; you might doubt their reality ; 
and we all know that they may be counterfeited 
upon paper, with a sponge and ro^c-water ! 

Addio, ben amata — it was my intention to go to 
the sea- side for a day, and be dipped, as they 
treat unfortunates suffering under hydrophobia ; 
but, without a miracle, I do not presume that I 
shall have regained force of resolution and intel- 
lect adequate to my attempting the voyage. • And 
there, too, I should see you again, source and spirit 
of all my tribulations, and my cicatrizing wounds 
would bleed anew ; still that would have been my 
sole object in going, to exist amphibiously, hke

rocks; and yet the shepherd in Virgil grew, at 
last, acquainted with Love, and found him a 
native of the rocks. But you would laugh clan- 
destinely at me in your hustled sleeve; for there 
is nothing more ridiculous than a person in my 
desperate state ; and I should only have to " bay 
the moon " with my solitary plaints, and exaspe- 
rate you, and the winds and the waves, with my 
vain jeremiades. For the future, I shall haunt 
you with sentimental elegies upon mourning paper, 
with a death's head crucified upon bones, by way

your sensibilities are as marbrees as your snowy 
complexion ; still I shall ever be immutably yours 
in this world ; and if our most devoted wishes and 
memories are allowed in the next, mine will still 
remain inviolable towards you. 

A Mademoiselle , GeoRGE BrUMMELL. 

Luc-sur-Mer. 

Had Brummell gone to Luc, there was no danger 
that his young friend would have betrayed her par- 
tiality, as did the wild beauty Undine, and plunge 
her teeth into his emaciated digit ; he might have 
disported himself for an eternal summer, *' between 
the raging billows and desolate rocks," without 
receiving such a flattering proof of success in his 
wooing. This village, which is on the coast, and 
about nine miles from Caen, is a most unromantic 
spot. The accommodation for visitors is extremely 
bad ; the sea-breezes are strongly impregnated with 
the smell of herrings, and not a bathing-machine 
or a tree is to be seen. It is, however, much fre- 
quented by the fashionables of the adjoining depart- 
ments, and sometimes by a few exclusives of the 
haute sod^te of Paris, afraid of the contamination 
with the bourgeois crowd at Dieppe ; and who, ladies 
and gentlemen, resort to the beach together, and 



126 THE LIFE OF 

politely dip each other. These bathing parties, 
and the celebrated oysters from the Rochers de 
Cancale, a few miles from the shore, are in general 
its only attractions ; but this season could boast an 
extra, and very novel one, in the shape of a charm- 
ing Polish Countess, who came neither in the pur- 
suit of health, nor amusement, but for the sole bene- 
fit of her pearls, of which she had a splendid suite, 
— a suite that the very oysters opposite would have 
envied; and while the general dipping and duck- 
ing was going on, she passed her mornings in air- 
ing them on the beach, in order that they might 
be more than brilliant the next winter at Vienna. 

To an Englishman of the present generation, this 
strange mode of bathings and mixture of sexes, 
waves, semds, sea-weed, jelly-fish, and conversa- 
tion, is a decided novelty; but that is all, for I 
never heard of any impropriety occurring in con- 
sequence of the custom ; and I always found these 
reunions in the water equally agreeable with those 
in the salons of Caen. Some of the ladies who 
were very careful of their complexions, which, by 
the bye, is, generally speaking, a useless anxiety 
in France, invariably took their parasols into the sea 
with them; and others, on leaving it, dried their 
hair, by promenading with it hanging loose down 



OEORGE BRUMMELL. 127 

their backs, like the horse tails on the old helmets 
of the Life Guards, though, to be sure, of a some- 
what finer texture. 

A spirited authoress, who has lately given to 
the world her Last Tour and First Work, has de- 
scribed French watering places to perfection, and 
also touched upon this social system of bathing. 
Lady Vavasour considers the English mere babies 
in the art compared with our neighbours. She 
says that at Plombi^res there was only a wooden 
partition (enough, one should think,) between the 
ladies and gentlemen, and the noise the latter made 
(mark, the latter,) was beyond any thing she ever 
heard. The bathers on both sides commenced their 
ablutions to instrumental music, then sang a duet, 
laughed, joked, and hallooed; and lastly, they 
danced, for a French lady proposed a quadrille. 

In another bath the company remained eight 
hours at a sitting, both sexes enjoying the natation 
together. Here a friend's friend of her ladyship, 
who had been invited to take a bath, was greatly 
surprised to find still in it, the whole party he had 
supped with the night before ; one gentleman hav- 
ing actually " breakfasted, dined, and supped in it.*' 
Should Lady V. be inclined to gratify her numerous 
admirers with a second work, I would recommend 
to her notice the aquatic quadrilles on the shores 



128 THE LIFE OF 

of the Black Sea, where (though I cannot, unfor- 
tunately, promise her the society of my own sex, 
or the enlivening harmony of a military band,) she 
will see the fair Sclavonians bathing en costume de 
haly dancing to the music of the murmuring waves 
of the Euxine. With this recommendation, how- 
ever, I ought in fairness to remind her that Odessa 
can only be reached by a pilgrimage over miles of 
steppe, or through the spoglia of a Russian quaran- 
tine. Extraordinary as this method of French 
bathing now seems to an Englishwoman, and 
** babies" though we be ** in the art of bathing," 
we were not such tyros in the days of our ancestors. 
There may perhaps still be a few who remember 
sitting in the King's bath, of old Bladud's healing 
waters, with their partners in the minuet of the 
night before, their heads powdered and pomatumed 
with all the rigeur q u^exigeait la mode du jour^ and 
who recollect having swam their snuflf-boxes across 
the bath in their wooden bowls to a friend on the 
opposite side. But her ladyship has possibly never 
seen the Bath Guide, and the description given by, 
the poet-laureat of the habits of that renowned place 
of pubUc resort, who remarks how pretty it was to 
see the visitors 



put on their flannels, 



And then take the water like so many spaniels ; 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 129 

And though all the while it grew hotter and hotter, 
They swam just as if they were hunting an otter ; 
*Twas a glorious sight to behold the fair sex, 
All wading with gentlemen up to their necks." 

But to return to Brammell. His young friends at 
the sea-side were not left long without hearing from 
him ; and the next amusing letter, from the length 
of the piece of poetry it inclosed, probably consumed 
more than one of his dull evenings in composing 
and inditing. 

Saturday evening, August, 1833. 

That ourang-outang of a bookseller has sent me 
a miserable French translation of Manzoni, instead 
of the original Italian which I demanded. He says 
the other was stolen from him. I am ashamed to 
convey this to you : from a superficial glance it 
looks as if it would bore you. If such may be its 
fate give it a worse, and cast it into the sea. There 
has been nothing, as yet, affiche in London or Paris 
which ofiers any assurance of being worthy to be 
read : the moment there is, you shall have it. 

My existence here has become perfectly dreary, 
insipid, and unprofitable : scarcely I see any one, 
speak to any one ; and I find myself so miserably 
ahattu ^nddistrail that I am incapable of passing away 
the lingering hours in those occupations which used 

VOL. II. K 



130 THE LIFE OF 

to be my resource and my amusement. This is all 
very wrong. I am conscious of all my culpable 
lassitude of mind and spirits, but for the soul of me 
I cannot collect sufficient energy to force myself 
away from this wretched place, much as it would be 
beneficial for me to do so. I have not sufficient 
fortitude, or the patience, or the resignation of 
Sadak, who wore away his life in traversing the 
wilds of Asia to find out the waters of oblivion. My 
only excursions from my cell are to the Cafarelli, — 
not a civilized being now there to exhilarate my 
solitary ramble, — with all the persecuting delusion 
of my distempered thoughts, I detect myself fre- 
quently looking back, in the fancy of seeing you and 
*### coming over the bridge ; but no such happiness 
awaits me. When I get home I strive to propitiate 
a few hours' forgetfulness in sleep — all in vain, and 
the morning comes again bright and blooming, but 
as little refreshing and satisfactory to me as the 
past night. But enough of these fantastic vapours 
of the brain. To change this larmoyantj &c. — 

Here followed a copy of the Butterfly's Funeral,

cludes thus : —

the abrupt and ungenerous termination of your last 
amiable note to me. Good night, good night ; 
unfading welfare and happiness be constantly with 
you, and may you dream of butterflies. 

Eternally yours, 

A Mademoiselle , G. B. 

Luc-sur-Mer, 

The extent to which Brummell evidently felt, 
and lamented, the total want of society, is dis- 
tressing to think of, when his age, sickness, po- 
verty, and early habits of intercourse with the 
highest and most accomplished is remembered; 
and, though it is true that he brought himself 
into that position by his own folly, the visitations 
of his declining years were much more severe than 
ever fell upon many of his class, more vicious and 
mischievous than he was. 

The promenade alluded to by the Beau in the 
preceding letter, as the one to which he usually 
resorted for daily exercise, is situated on the banks 
of the Ome, beyond the port, and in the direction 
of the sea. The walk is approached from one of 
the quays by a bridge, and, being at a consider- 
able distance from the principal streets, is little 
frequented, excepting by the bourgeoisie, who have 
their diminutive gardens near it ; or on Sunday

132 THE LIFE OF 

evenings, when the band of the regiment quartered 
in the town performs there, and attracts the whole 
population en masse. It received its appellation of 
CafareUi, in compliment to one of Napoleon's pr^fets 
of that name, under whose administration the 
ground was laid out, and planted with several rows 
of trees ; but the situation is bleak and unfavour- 
able to their growth ; their foliage is too scanty to 
afford any shade for the promenaders ; and the 
picturesque appearance of the walk is about on a 
par with that of a Dutch toy. 

Caen, Uke the generality of large country towns 
on the Continent, has several public walks; and 
it is impossible to see how much they contribute 
to the comfort of the humbler classes of their 
inhabitants, and not regret the want of them in our 
own manufacturing cities, in which, from the ex- 
treme density of the population, they would be 
doubly valuable : — the want of them is a cruel 
deficiency in our social system, which ought to be 
remedied without delay. Surely no class of people 
in the world stands more in need of these arenas 
for exercise and relaxation than our operatives, who, 
from the very moment of their birth, breathe the 
unwholesome atmosphere of a room, in which the 
members of a numerous family, and perhaps even 
more than one family, are huddled together. While 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 133 

yet mere children, they exchange this impure ele- 
ment for that of a crowded factory, which the 
cupidity of their employers and the nature of their 
occupation render still more deleterious than that 
in which they have till then existed ; the vicinity 
of the fly-wheel of the engine is the only spot in 
this heavy mass of close and foetid vapour that is 
ever agitated ; the baneful effects of which are 
daily witnessed, in the diseases that consign thou- 
sands of these miserable beings to an untimely 
grave. To them, alas ! Nature is unknown ; the 
carol of the lark, the call of the cuckoo, the 
cheerful hum of the bees returning from their 
toil, are sounds that the ears of many could not 
recognise ; of the colour of the harebell or the 
gorse, the smell of the honeysuckle or the new- 
mown hay, they are equally ignorant — and the fresh 
air of the early morning in the spring has never 
fallen on their brow, to gladden their hearts, or 
invigorate their bodies and their minds. If the 
artificial state of society with us has created a 
population thus unhappily circumstanced, it surely 
is a duty imperative on those who profit by their 
misery, to alleviate it, £fnd on the legislature of 
their country, to secure to them the enjoyment of 
these natural pleasures — created by the Almighty 
to bless aUke the rich and poor. 



134 THE LIFE OF 

I was led into this digression by the remem- 
brance of the pleasure I had often felt in observ- 
ing the cheerful countenances of hundreds of the 
poor inhabitants of Caen, strolling on the fing 
summer evenings along the splendid promenades 
of the town ; and the many old lace-makers, sit- 
ting under the trees diligently plying their bob- 
bins, and earning, a pittance it is true, but not 
at the risk of their Uves. The favourite rendez^ 
vous, however, are the " Grand Cours," and the 
** Cours de la Reine," which every Norman justly 
considers the chief ornaments of the province: 
these noble public w^alks are more central than the 
Cafarelli. One side of the Grand Cours is watered 
by the Orne, which, owing to the weir above the 
bridge, is always kept at a high level ; the meadow 
on the other, occupying a surface of many hundred 
acres, and bounded by the village of Louvigny at 
one end, and the heights of AUemagne in the dis- 
tance, is enlivened by large herds of cattle, and a 
branch of the Orne, which, diverted from its course, 
meanders through it, fertilizing its rich and exten- 
sive pasture. This stream afterwards takes a wind- 
ing course through the very centre of the town, 
and rejoins the river at the extremity of the quay. 
The hills of Allemagne are of great interest in 
the eyes of an Englishman, for, from them were 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 135 

quarried, eight centuries ago, the stones of that 
noble Abbey, within whose walls repose the honoured 
remains of so many of England's most gallant and 
intellectual sons. The splendid avenues of stately 
elms which grace this cours, look nearly as venera- 
ble as that ancient pile ; and the trees near the river 
spread their giant branches and redundant foliage 
far across its tranquil surface. ( 

On a fSte-day, the farmers' wives and daughters, 
who are to be seen here with their high caps, flow- 
ing lappets, and bright green or red aprons, are as 
fine specimens of nature as the elms, both in height 
and beauty ; but they, and a multitude of merry 
faces beaming with a homely, but happy, disposi- 
tion to please and be pleased, had no charms for a 
misanthrope. Brummell, either from affectation, or 
the early habit of constantly associating with the 
most select society, disliked large crowds of people, 
where its different classes were mingled together. 
The fair, which lasts a fortnight, and is held on the 
Grand Cours and the Cours de la Reine, he never 
entered ; but inquired occasionally of his acquaint- 
ance, what was going on there ? To have been seen 
within its precincts, would have been far too much 
like the rest of the world. Lister says, '* that in 
London, in his palmy days, he never went beyond 
the door at a ball, except at some favoured houses. 



136 THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 

He generally stood at the entrance, and paid the 
usual compliment of a few minutes' conversation 
to the lady of the house, and did not commit 
himself by jostling within." The Beau sought the 
Cours Cafarelli for its retirement, perhaps for its 
formality; and there wore away many a weary hour, 
with no other companions than his dog and his own 
cheerless thoughts. 



CHAPTER XI. 

Letters to bis friends living near the sea-side— They retam to the town for

To return, however, to his last letter. He had the 
gratification of finding The Butterfly's Funeral favour- 
ably received, and his tristesse procured him a 
compassionate reply, which seems to have had the 
happiest effects upon his spirits, for his next is 
written in a much more cheerful tone. 

Tuesday evening. 

May the recording angel, who registers above 
the amiable feelings and thoughts of mortals, pre- 
serve you for having written that last note to me ! 
It has at once extricated me from the very abyss 
of gloomy and disconsolate reflections, and has 
restored me to peace and equanimity. After read- 
ing it, I sought another wander to the Cafarelli, 
and returned home to my solitary room at the hotel, 
contented with myself and all the world. I do 
not know myself again. 



138 THE LIFE OF 

I have this morning perambulated over this de- 
serted town, acknowledged every one whose phy- 
siognomy was familiar to me, lanc^ two bad jokes 

at his Excellency Monsieur le Baron de , in 

judgment of his new heathenish mouse-coloured 
pantaloons, and even disturbed my hat with my 

best strait-laced salutation to Madame d'A , 

and her contemptible troop of monkeys in the shape 
of men. When I mentioned the Baron to you 
the other day, as having fallen into an inherit- 
ance, it was all mythological moonshine. — Poor 
fellow ! I believe he has nothing but his panta- 
loons and his misconceived amour propre, to which 
he can look forward. 

Upon my knees I supplicate one of you to write 
to me, when you have not any more interesting 
object to divert you ; when the expanse of waters, 
and the unfruitful waste of earth which surrounds 
you, have wearied your unvaried prospect — pray 
write and tell me you think of me, be it so or 
not ; " be for once forsworn," if you are thinking 
of any one else ; it will gratify me beyond all other 
sublunary blessings. 

Do not imagine that I am endeavouring to flatter 
you ; I never did encourage such a subtle and de- 
grading intention, and I never shall, but you writ^ 
beautifully.

"Les deux Fiancees/' which I have never read,

When the autumn was over, his friends returned 
to their habitations in the town, and the Beau ap- 
pears to have marked his gratitude to one of his 
marine correspondents of the summer by presenting 
her, on Christmas Day, with an etrenne in anticipa- 
tion of the New Year. The presentation of this gift 
is the principal subject of his next note. 

December 25, 1833. 

It is the hallowed f(Ste of Christmas, nativity, 
mince-pies, mistletoe, wind gentle evergreens, and

My fire is going to give up the ghost in sighs

on the 31st. I must elapse from my sabots upon 
the occasion, and galope with the rest. 

Brummell, happily for him, was sufficiently 
thawed to go to this ball; indeed he was seldom 
so frozen in the evening that he could not " elapse," 
when and wherever there was any whist going on, 
or an opportunity offered for quizzing. Of the 
latter he was certain to have plenty at Madame de 
Rigny^s, whose salons resembled a jar of piccalilly ; 
for here might be seen the ultra-Carlist, the modere, 
and the jmte milieu ; indeed partisans of all kinds, 
Guizoistes, Molistes, Thieristes, &c. These parties 
were very agreeable to Brummell, for his waltzing 
days were over; but to a young Englishman who 
dances, a French provincial ball will scarcely ap- 
pear so amusing as those in his own country, and 
he must string his nerves as tight as the instru- 
ments he is about to caper to, to encounter, with 
tolerable comfort, the two formidable rows of fe- 
males ranged round the walls of the room. On 
the upper tier are the do)vagers and chaperons, 
judiciously rouged and enamelled, busily scrutiniz- 
ing one another's toilette and renovations, the im- 
mense supply of flowers in their heads leading one 
to suppose they had plundered the flower-pots in- 
tended to ornament the staircase ; for on no occa- 



142 THE LIFE OF 

sion could I ever detect a single blossom on these 
plants. On the lower bench are the young ladies, 
each with a volume of microscopic dimensions in 
her hand, looking as formal and precise as their 
natural vivacity and elegant tournure will permit. 

The gentlemen, also, with books in their hands, 
are in rapid movement in front of them, bowing, 
shuffling, scribbling, scraping, and crossing from 
one side of the room to the other. What crowd- 
ing and pushing, what fuming and fussing ! ^^AuraU 
je rhonneur,^' says one gentleman, pulUng out his 
jewelled pencil-case. " Pardon, Madame," exclaims 
another, having just then half crushed a foot, 
chauss^ in satin, with his thick-soled boot ; while 
the girls write away like mad, and murmur the 
number of their different partners, as glibly as if 
they were Paternosters or Ave Marias. A New- 
market man, ignorant of French, would fancy they 
were making bets, instead of booking engagements 
to dance for the whole evening, — for such is the 
invariable routine with which the ball commences. 
This anxiety off the minds of the indefatigable 
cavaliers, the bustle subsides, and the lady of the 
house, who has meanwhile been standing, like a 
queen on a twelfth cake, in the centre of the 
room, gossiping with the old gentlemen, retires, and 
leaves the ground open to the dancers. But the 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 143 

formality of the two female circles, into which a 
male never presumes to intrude, is infused into 
the quadrille. All personal introduction is, it is 
true, dispensed with ; the mere fact of a man's being 
in the same room with a lady, entitles him to ask 
her to dance, and she cannot refuse the obtrusive 
compliment, no matter whether he is well or ill- 
mannered, graceful or gawky ; whether his face is 
as smooth as her own, or covered with as much 
hair as a Russian mujik's; whether he is scented 
with eau de Portugal, eau de vie, or bad cigars, 
she must be his for one mortal half-hour — ^perhaps 
to waltz — "ay there's the rub!" The same free- 
and-easy custom prevails even at the public balls at 
the Prefecture and the H6tel de Ville. 

This system, which is lax enough to have suited 
Egalite himself, " avec son dme de laquais,'' and 
of which extreme formality is the result, would at 
first sight appear to have a very opposite tendency. 
But this is not the case; half the figurants and 
figurantes do not know each other's names ; and 
if, as in Madame de Rigny's salons, the society is 
mixed, they may not wish to do so : there is, 
therefore, every inducement to avoid, rather than 
enter into conversation. As married women, they 
have every right to be as loquacious as they 
please ; and, by a very recent innovation, the girls 



144 THE LIFE OF 

are occasionally seen to waltz : but in the contre- 
danses, to which their exertions have hitherto been 
confined, it is an understood thing that they are to 
be mum ! 

At a ball, some years ago, in this same town of 
Caen, '* when I was in my thoughtless youth," and 
yet ignorant that in a French quadrille Harpocrates 
was always the companion of Terpsichore, a French 
sylph in her teens, just fresh from her convent, 
enlightened me upon this subject in the most novel 
and amusing manner possible. Poor little creature ! 
she looked delighted to escape from confinement ; 
and when we had taken our places I lost no time 
in opening an animated battery of conversation 
upon her ; but conceive my consternation, my 
gentle countrywomen, particularly you who have 
just laid your governesses on the shelf, and full of 
spirits and English independence, anticipate by day 
and dream by night of the triumphs of the approach- 
ing season ; conceive my agitation when, at the very 
first pause that occurred, my pretty partner addressed 
me in these words : — '* Monsieur, nous sommes ici 
pour danser, pas pour causer." I looked no doubt 
annoyed, as well I might : it was of no use, however, 
she was mute : but her piquante face, with hair cb 
la Chinoise, and very speaking eyes, seemed to say, 
" Ah certes quand je serai mari^ je causerai h mon 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 145 

grd." The quadrille over, I led her, as etiquette 
decreed, to her place ; and, bowing as low as the 
bench on whicli she seated herself, left her to 
relate the details of such an unusual and tragic 
occurrence to Madame la Marquise Mfere, who ex- 
pressed herself of course sufficiently astonished at 
such English ignorance and effrontery, and ap- 
plauded her daughter's perfect discretion. 
. In France, an Englishman is soon made aware 
that to speak to a girl, even when sitting next to 
her mother, is indecorous, unless it be to ask her 
to dance ; but to say a word to her, when she has 
assumed the perpendicular for that purpose, is a 
positive breaking down the quickset of proprieties 
" that doth hedge" a demoiselle. Do these pre- 
cautions improve the connubial qualifications of 
Frenchwomen, and make them better wives ? It is 
doubtful. Ideas and forms of this nature arising 
from the " non-intervention" system, throw a cold- 
ness over French society, and an unpleasant reserve 
is the consequence. In a ball-room the dancers are 
reduced to automatons, and mechanically return, 
as the music of each set ceases, to the seats they 
originally and respectively occupied, and which are 
as strictly kept as those of a theatre. The privi- 
leges and pleasures of a ball are ours ; on this, the 
French side of the channel, (which, by the way, we 

VOL. II. L 



146 THE LIFE OF 

have, with Brummellian exclusiveness, called the 
British, as if we had both sides of it,) there is no 
pleasant promenade with a pretty or witty girl, to 
look for an ice in the refreshment room, or quiz 
and confabulate about old partners, and captivate 
and secure new ones. 

The salons of a fe^ of the stoutest legitimists at 
Caen were exceptions to the extreme coldness and 
formality I have described ; for though the same 
rule existed as to individual introductions, the 
families were all known to each other, and no one 
of modified opinions ever thought of disturbing the 
aristocratic repose of their porte-cocheres. It was 
however sometimes impossible to help smiling at the 
manner in which this party testified their loyalty, 
and the ungrateful return it met with. The winter 
of 1833 was made as dull as a funeral to the whole 
of the legitimist party in France by the arrest of 
the Duchess of Berri, and her incarceration at 
Blaye. 

She was at this time the soul of the cause, 
and looked up to as a second Cl^mence de Cond^ ; 
not a creature would dance, and it was said that a 
few of the most devoted and devout of the dowagers 
actually fasted. In fact, the conduct of this party 
went far to disprove the assertion so piquantly made 
by their countryman Stanislas de Girardin, who, 



OEOROE BRUMMELL. 147 

when his friend the Prdfet complained that the 
inhabitants of Caen would not erect a triumphal 
arch, and give a suitable reception to Napoleon, 
said, ** Comment voulez-vous inspirer de I'enthou- 
siasme h des gens qui ne boivent que du cidre." 

As the young men could not dance, they took 
care to substitute the agrement of dejeuners a la 
fourchette. At one of these, when busily engaged 
with the oysters, we were suddenly interrupted in 
this agreeable occupation by the unexpected en- 
trance of an old veteran royalist of their acquaint- 
ance. " Mon Dieu, Messieurs," said the intruder, 
in great distress, *' have you heard the news ? the 
Duchess" — " is delivered?" we all exclaimed, '' Non 
mes enfans, mais^ accouch^e." This " fait accom- 
pli," went far to annihilate the personal interest in 
the Royalist cause excited by the intrepidity of the 
Duchess de Berri.

CHAPTER XII. 

Letter to a Mother of Pearls — ^Bnunmell's present to her — Old regime 
morality — Brummell again attacked by paralysis — His presence of mind 

on this occasion — Dr. K 's kindness to him — Brommell's patience 

daring illness — Letter after his convalescence — His young fayourite's 
album — His note to her. 

A FEW days after the mince-pie and mistletoe 
note was despatched, Brummell forwarded another 
etrenne to one of his fair friends. Lest the reader 
should be mystified by his splendid metaphorical 
allusions, it will perhaps be as well to observe, 
that the matron in question numbered the Graces 
in her family, fortunately, not the Muses ; and that 
the gift was a paper-knife, the material of which was 
mother-of-pearl. The result of his. thus putting his 
language upon stilts is. the most complete confu- 
sion ; for a plain man, if indeed he could make 
anything of it at all, would suppose that the lady 
was in the habit of dividing the leaves of the last 
new novel, or marking her place, with the greasy 
knife that she had just used to cut her "bread 
and butter." This is really atrocious, and Brum- 
mell, with all his elegance, deserved to be well 



THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 149 

trounced for subjecting her to such a foul sus- 
picion. 

January 3, 1834. 

In vain I have been expecting Beckford's Let- 
ters from Paris; this moment the answer comes 
to me, that 'there is not a copy remaining, and I 
must attend the republication — they were destined 
for your acceptance, and it is very hard upon me. 
En attendant^ I will take the Uberty to submit 
the offering of a modest tribute intended as an 
accessary, more harmonizing with your fair hands, 
than the forbidding instrument that usually admi- 
nisters to your morning's repast, (in plain language, 
I mean cutting bread and butter ! ) which by some 
treacherous tdche a la tartine, may endanger the 
opening or the record of the page you read. I 
wish it consisted of one Genuine Pearl ! — it is but 
the nominal mother of them. Yet, you possess 
the happy privilege to claim that congenial title, 
and I beg to present it, as the humble counter- 
feit of yourself. 

Korizaida is a beautiful modern Greek name 
which Byron mentions as often found among the 
** native seraphs" of those soft classic isles — its con- 
struction is *' Cluster of Pearls ;" should you be 
disposed to change your own it would, in metaphor, 
be appropriate to you all. 



150 THE LIFE OF 

I have no news favourable or adverse to com- 
municate ; for many days I have not transgressed 
the wicket of my cell before vespers — I sit en 
Calmouky enveloped in sable, musing over the fire 
like a poet in distress, and ruminate upon other 
times and fairy prospects that will never come 
again, and I scarcely know whether the sun has 
been in shine or in sorrow. 

I was up to a dissipated hour this morning, 

playing at five-sous whist, with Madame d'A . 

Improvident pursuit! She made half-closed eyes 

at me, instead of attending to the game : this 

afflicted me afterwards with a relative caiiehemar — 

I fancied, in the dream, I was struggling with my 

Aunt Margaret's ghost — I am still dormant^ and 

only just able to whisper to you how 

Sincerely I am yours, 

A Madame , % G. B. 

Rue des . 

The person whose sentimental glances thus afflicted 
the Beau with nightmare, was a diminutive wizen old 
Countess of good family, who took quantities of snuflT, 
occasionally dimmed the shining parquet with an 
expectoration, wrote satirical verses on the manners 
of the juste milieu^ and sonnets to the youthful 
Henri Cinq. To hear one of these antique speci- 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 151 

mens of the ancien regime dilate upon the state of 
French society as it was in their youth, was not 
very creditable to their generation ; and this lady, 
in her extreme detestation of anything sober, cer- 
tainly overrated the improvement of the present. 
*VAh, Monsieur," I heard this octogenarian say one 
evening, ** que nos salons sont tristes ! Je ne m'y 
connais plus. Dans ma jeunesse, une femme avait 
ses amis, et son maris les siennes ; chacun s'amusait 
selon sa mani^re: k present on voit les dpoux 
toujours ensembles! — mais c'est une Y6rit6 cela. 
Ah ! qu'ils sont vilains les usages d'aujourd'hui." 

Towards the end of April, 1834, poor Brummell 
was again attacked by paralysis : he was seized at 
the table d'hote \ and the circumstance that first 
made him conscious of the fact, was finding that 
his soup was trickling down his chin instead of 
going into his mouth. Instead of making any ex- 
clamation or gesture of surprise, he, with his usual 
presence of mind, immediately rose from the table, 
and quietly putting his napkin to his face, left the 
room with such perfect dehberation and self-posses- 
sion, that none of the guests were at all aware of his 
misfortune, and they imagined that he retired merely 
from some feeUng of temporary indisposition. 

But before going to his room, the staircase lead- 
ing to which was on the other side of the court- 



152 THE LIFE OF 

yard of the hotel, he went into one adjoining that 
in which the table d'hote was held, and consulted 
the looking-glass over the mantel-piece. One 
glance was sufficient, for it showed him that his 
mouth was drawn up to his ear, and he hastily 
retreated to his apartments. This mode of pro- 
ceeding was characteristic of the Beau, who had a 
great antipathy to being thought either old or ill ; 
and he was quite as anxious to establish five and- 
forty, as Louis Quatorze was to fix seventy, for 
** Vdge de tout le monde ;'' in fact Brummell, when 
speaking of his age, never owned to more than 
fifty. If any lady pressed him on this delicate 
subject, he always called in the name of some noble 
friend to his aid, who, according to the Peerage, was 
many years younger than himself, and, asserting 
that they were at school together, would plausibly 
make him out to be two years his senior. 

His medical adviser who attended him on this 
and other occasions was a very humane and gene- 
rous man, and paid him the greatest possible atten- 

tion, without fee or reward of any kind. Dr. K 

gave him an excellent character as an invalid, and 
said that he never knew any one more gentle or 
obedient in severe illness. Once only had they 
any difierence of opinion ; it was caused by Brum- 
mell's affection for a few stray hairs that grew at 



OEORGE BRUMMELL. 153 

the back of his head, and which, though concealed 
by his wig, he was most anxious to preserve. 
When it was found necessary to apply a bUster, he 
strongly objected to parting with these few me- 
mentos of his former chevelure, and asked Dr. 

K , with a melancholy smile, whether he must 

absolutely lose them? but, on his assuring him 
that the blister could not be put on unless they 
were removed, he resigned his head to the hairdresser 
with becoming composure. The next letter was 
written almost immediately after his recovery from 
this attack, and shows not only how severe his ill- 
ness must have been, but how his drooping ener- 
gies were devoted to his favourite protegees. 

Monday morning. 

Allow me to present you with a sketch ; it is in a 
sadly unfinished state, but it will at least prove to 
you that I can sometimes keep my promise, and 
travailler for your album. I have lately possessed 
neither nerves or capacity to go on with two other 
drawings that I have sur les mains. They require 
more assiduity and fatigue than I can at present 
bestow upon them, and, as I am anxious that they 
should be perfect, you must accord me time and 
health to accomplish them. 

The sketch is from memory : it is a resemblance 



154 THE LIFE OF 

of a very amiable person, who is now no more, — 
of Georgiana, Lady Worcester. In former days I 
drew a miniature of her, which Worcester now has, 
and the traits are still fresh in my remembrance. It 
is the first thing that I have attempted since my 
resurrection ; for you must know that I have been 
in the other world, and I can assure you I found it 
no paradise. 

It seems that I have recently been in a state 
of absence, or aberration of mind, and utterly 
unconscious of it till this morning, when, upon 
my interrogating him, — I mean one of my doctors, 
— he told me that when he came to me eight days 
ago I was in a high fever, and that during three 
days and nights I had frequently asked absurd 
questions, and talked to him in a distrait and 
unconnected manner ; in short, that I was wan- 
dering in my senses, and ''babbling about green 
fields and butterfiies." I recollect nothing but their 
having deprived me almost of daily bread, and 
my making resistance and wry faces at lancets 
and lenitives. As I do not like to be regarded as 
a confirmed lunatic, pray keep this a secret. 

I am not of adequate dignity to have daily bul- 
letins of my health, for I hate troubling other peo- 
ple about it ; but now, that the visitation is over, 
I can produce, if necessary, under their hands. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 155 

the authenticity of what I have taken the Uberty to 
represent to you. I am now passing well, though 
rather reduced ond weak : let all your amabilite be 
gathered together to commiserate me. 

Do you intend to summer among the mermaids ? 
I have the truest wish to shake hands with you 
again ; but do not, which you may mean in kind- 
ness, ask me anything about my health ; it makes 
me melancholy, and that abaissement sometimes 
makes me very childish. Addio cara arnica. 

Ever sincerely yours, 

A Mademoiselle , G. B. 

Luc-sur-Mer. 

It will be seen by the latter part, and the address 
of this letter, that his more intimate friends had 
again migrated to the sea-side, when his gossiping 
billets, as usual, became more circumstantial. 

Thursday Evening. 

It would be trespassing too much upon your 
indulgence, to retain your album any longer. A 
wandering sea-gull, dripping from the waves, has 
this morning perched at my window, and has told 
me delicately, through the curtains, that you were 
at every moment anxious about it — he did not 
tell me why. — I restore it to you. It was my wish 



156 



THE LIFE OF 



to have delivered it in my own humble person this 
very day; but maturer reflection, and indisposi- 
tion, have dissuaded me from that gratification. 

I am unwell — I had flattered myself that I was 
progressing towards my ancient regular health; 
and now those who look after me professionally, 
will insist upon it that my lungs are seriously 
affected, and pester me with all the alarming hyper- 
bole of their vocation, upon my malady. They 
are weaving a shroud about me; still, I trust I 
shall yet escape. 

I have obtained some new magnifying-glasses, 
and have been striving to make two drawings for 
you. I have accomplished all the early prelimi- 
nary outlines, and to proceed, I am only waiting 

for my colours, which Mrs. B (devil take her 

carelessness) has decamped with to the coun- 
try. I am, however, concerned to perceive, that 
I cannot draw and finish as I used to do; my 
vision seems to grow opaque, and indiscriminating ; 
(I need not tell you this,) my head is scarcely 
ever exempt from some disquietude or other ; and 
my hand, from a sort of nervousness, which inces- 
santly visits me, trembles Uke the rushes that shade 
the '' Grave of the Butterfly.'' 

I have sent to Paris and to London for other 
drawings, that will better suit your fancy and your 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 157 

purpose. I do not admire engraved vignettes and 
prints introduced into an album where there is 
only writing; besides they are always common- 
place, therefore I do not take the liberty to send 
you any. 

In regard to poetry, I dare not monopolize even 
half a vacant page in inditing sonnets to your beau- 
tiful eyebrows, or in pathetic numbers singing, 
like the dying swan, my own elegy. You already 
possess my album, which is a faithful record of 
almost all the metrical romance of my past days, 
and also of the productions of several of those 
brilliant planets who once diflFiised their rays aJ)out 
the world. If it may sometimes be of use or 
amusement to you, accept it from me; it is but 
a poor old album indeed, and unworthy as a gift 
to you ; but it has been for years the constant 
companion and friend of more solitary hours, and 
has often solaced and diverted me through the 
many vicissitudes, errors, and disappointments of 
my life. 

It has lately been intimated to me, that I must 
be prepared to leave Caen ; this is from Govern- 
ment in England ; how soon, I know not. I am 
ignorant also of my destination — that will depend 
upon, and be dictated by, those in power, who 
have still the kind consideration to think of me 



158 THE LIF£ OF OEORGE BRUMMELL. 

and my broken fortunes. For years, I have che- 
rished the wish to go to Italy ; and, if what I 
have solicited in my answer should be accorded 
to me, I shall take up my wallet and my staff, 
and seek the auspicious heaven of that country 
and climate. This is no fairy dream ! 

Yesterday, for the first time for four days, I 
left my room and dined with * * * *, and Henri 
de Vauquelin; the former seems delighted to be 
released from refreshing billows and herrings, — 
happy huroTi! 

And now I will bid you the best of all good 
nights, faites moi Tamiti^ de me prosterner, moi et 
mes souvenirs les plus devoues, at the feet of Madame 
# # # # . yQij ^iii uQt reject them, though from their 
frequent iteration they may have become rather en- 
nuyeux and maussades, and in one brief month from 
my disappearance, do not forget the earnest interest 
and friendship that I shall always feel for you. 

Ever sincerely yours, 

A Mademoiselle , G. B. 

Luc-sur-Mer. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

Brammell's consideration for dumb animals— Hia attachment to a mouse— 
His cyoicism — His indignant note to Mademoiselle Aimable respecting her 
cats— All hope of employment at an end— Projected trip to the sea- side — 
His- pecuniary troubles — Letter to his friend Lord Alvanley — King Allen 
— Bmrnmell's indiscretion at a soirSe — He celebrates it in verse. 

There is much good feeling expressed in the let- 
ter with which the last chapter concludes — grati- 
tude to his friends, and regret for his errors : 
these are reverted to so naturally and unaffect- 
edly, that it would be scarcely charitable to doubt 
his sincerity, and there is something very pleasing 
in the manner in which he lays his griefs and cares 
before his youthful correspondent, for whom, as the 
reader will observe, he had a sexagenarian lover's 
regard. Though satirical and selfish to an unusual 
^tegree, Brummell was never so entirely deficient in 
the amiable qualities of the heart as many persons 
believed him to be; he was humane, and always 
excessively fond of, and kind to, dumb animals. 

In his promenades he never failed to express his 
indignation at the cruelty of the Normans towards 
their horses. " The rascals ! the scoundrels !" he 



160 THE LIFE OF 

would exclaim ; and, in the winter, the ledge of his 
window was always covered with crumbs for his 
feathered friends on the neighbouring house-tops. 
While residing at the H6tel d'Angleterre, and about 
this period, he one morning laid aside all etiquette, 
and without waiting for an introduction, made the 
acquaintance of a poor Uttle mouse, that had taken 
up its abode in the wainscot of his sitting- 
room ; to this tiny creature he became very niuch 
attached, and by dint of careful and gentle training, 
taught it to crawl up his leg on to the breakfast- 
table, and eat out of his hand. It became, at length, 
like Baron Trenk's spider, quite a companion, 
and made its appearance regularly every morning, 
at the same hour. One day, while Brummell was 
paying his accustomed visit to a lady, who related 
the anecdote to the author, she observed that he 
was very much out of spirits ; and, on her in- 
quiring the reason, he told her, with great embar- 
rassment in his manner, that the gargon had that 
morning thrown a boot-jack at his little favourite, 
and killed it. Like pets in general, it came to an 
untimely end, and Brummell was now in a situ- 
ation to feel the loss of it ; for there was little left 
him on which to exercise his sympathies. ,To 
assert that he, a man of the world, was endowed 
with great tenderness of feeling, would be absurd. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 161 

but it would be equally unjust to say that he was 
destitute of it. There are few persons entirely 
without sensibilities, or who do not in some degree 
sympathize with the affections of others, though 
their own feelings may have been chilled by their 
own follies, or the disappointments and vexa- 
tions of life. The direction they then take, how- 
ever, is sometimes singular enough. The cynical 
Beau, satiated with every pleasure, and callous to 
almost every species' of excitement, could weep 
over the untimely death of a mouse, and grieve 
at the loss of his favourite dog : while the death of 
some of the companions of his early life would 
possibly have created little emotion in his mind ; 
for with the remembrance of them would be asso- 
ciated recollections of the insincere and trifling 
character of their friendship and career, and bitter 
reflections on his past and present position — disease 
reminding him of the brilliant revels of the pa- 
lace; and penury, the sums that he had squan- 
dered in wanton and unmeaning extravagance. 
Bnimmell's occasional flts of cynicism for his own 
species surpassed even those of Diogenes himself, 
as the following remark made to his landlady will 
prove. *' Madame de St. Ursain, were I to see a 
man and a dog drowning together in the same 
pond, and no one was looking on, I would prefer 

VOL. II. M 'j^ 



162 THE LIFE OF 

saving the dog !" What an illustration of the state 
of his feelings ! Of his forethought and considera- 
tion for this lady's cats, the succeeding note, written 
to her daughter, when he was living in the Rue des 
Carmes, will give some idea. 

Thursday. 

Dear Miss Aimable, 

You have recently made such a rapid progress 
in the English language, at least in writing it, that 
I do not think a partial relaxation from your daily 
task would be detrimental to this branch of your 
instruction. It is very delightful and commend- 
able to learn, when one feels the propensity to do 
so ; but still, one should not totally forsake other 
little customary avocations, which are as requisite, 
and perhaps more amiable, than incessantly filling 
one's brains with English and Italian. 

To improve the head, it is not necessary to neg- 
lect the natural dictates of the heart; and I will 
beg to observe, that for many days and nights 
there has not been any fresh straw in the basket- 
bed of the two cats, Ourika and her eleve Angolina. 
You are comfortably couched, and dreaming pro- 
bably of butterflies, or of the Chateau de Ham, 
while these poor animals are waiting, half frozen, 
my return home, to let them into a warmer place of 



6E0RGB BRUMMELL. 163 

rest. I cannot resist their mewing supplications, 
though I have latterly taken care to close the door, 
for fear their aide-de-camp, Tigre,* might also get 
in, and houspiller Jacko's cage. I would rather 
preserve my feelings of humanity and tenderness 
for these mute domestic creatures, than acquire 
all the languages in the world ! 

Yours, out of temper ! 

To Miss Aimable. G. B. 

The hope of obtaining employment, as expressed 
in his letter a few pages back, was but tran- 
sient; and Lord Granville's reply, to which he 
alludes in the one that follows, appears unfortu- 
nately to have set the matter at rest: this disap- 
pointment, frequent spasmodic attacks to which 
he had been subject since his illness, and the 
anxieties resulting from poverty, drove him to the 
use of opiates for relief. 

TucHclfty Kvcning. 
My colours are redeemed, and without any 
further intermission you shall be obeyed, and I 
will prosecute mon travail for you. In the mean 
time, to demonstrate to you that I have not been 
idle and forgetful of you, I prelude my humble

oblations at your shrine, and your shrine alone, by 
a precipitate sketch, which is out of my usual way 
of drawing, as it is a landscape, but which, between 
ourselves, is not so bad a beginning, 

I am much afraid I wrote some sad nonsense 
to you on Saturday night. I had been in pain 
during the day, and had recourse to that derang- 
ing drug, at least for the senses, laudanum — I 
know all my failings when I come into the pos- 
session of my intellects again. 

I have had a letter from Granville, in reply 
to one I wrote to him at the time I enclosed my 
letter to Palmerston through him at Paris, re- 
questing his admonition, and he tells me, there is 
no vacancy in Italy or elsewhere at present, except- 
ing the one which he recommends me to refusCy and 
which I was ordered to prepare for ten days since, 
and I have declined it. I shall now remain here ; 
and I can assure you, that the predominant agr^- 
ment in my continued sejour will be, the attraction 
and charm of your friendship and society. I shall 
be again dead and buried, if you do not write me 
two words bearing the absolution of my sins ; and 
what is of much more consequence, telling me that 
you are well again. I have ordered a cab, as the 
sun seems to be in good humour, and shall shake 
hands with you in a few hours. Pray endeavour 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 165 

to assume a smile or two, for I am dreadfully in 

the dismals — elle est Men gentille voire cousine. 

Most sincerely yours, 

A Mademoiselle , GeorgE BrummeLL. 

Luc-sur-Mer. 

It was one of these numerous applications, either 
to Lord Palmerston or some other friend, that 
he concluded by saying, he hoped he should not 
be allowed to " die like William the Conqueror , in 
Normandy.^' But though he could sometimes be 
facetious on such subjects, his letters at this 
period were not written in a very Hvely spirit. 

Saturday, July 20th. 

Why had you not the amiable recollection to 
write me two words, to say you had received the 
books I sent you on Tuesday ? Do so in consider- 
ate amity to me to-morrow. I am very forlorn 
and miserable here — abandoned by every one whose 
presence was in some measure satisfactory to me 
— I start at my own shadow. I must put an end to 
this, or I shall expire upon my own solitary lucu- 
brations. There is nothing left to liberate me 
from this state of mental dissolution but going 
down to Luc, and once more seeing and shaking 
hands with you all. That, I am persuaded, would 



166 THE LIFE OF 

do me more good than any other earthly re^- 
men, and contribute to enable me to linger on in 
this world for perhaps another year. 

One of these lovely evenings, (for I am not out 
of temper with the elements,) I shall again make a 
pilgrimage to Luc, and ascertain that I have been 
haunted by you merely in imagination. But where 
am I to repose in that land of infertility ? I detest 
that vile caravanserai of Colignon's, and most of 
those who infest it. The nereids and mermaids are 
too cold in their dispositions to extend to me any 
desirable hospitality ; and the *' yellow sands," (par- 
ticularly if they retain their hue, which offends me,) 
during the night, would promise but a poor for- 
bidding pillow. I must '* make me a willow cabin 
at your gate, and call upon my soul within the 
house ;" but no one will come : so I believe it will 
be better for me to retrace my steps to Caen, arm- 
in-arm with the moon, if she is not too diffident and 
reserved to permit such social tete-cL-tete travelling. 

De Chazot has just called, and had the friend- 
liness to invite me to accept his daily bread while 
I was at Luc. I told him of my objections to take 
up my quarters at Colignon's, and that I had aban- 
doned the project. He would not be satisfied till 
I had promised to dine with him on Friday next, 
or Thursday, if 1 was sufficiently re-established in 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 167 

health. I shall go there, whether I am expiring or 
not, and I conclude that I shall find you flirting 
with sea breezes on the beach. 

Yours very sincerely, 

A Mademoiselle , G. B. 

Luc-sur-Mer. 

The lowness of spirits betrayed in this letter may 
be attributed not only to the absence of his friends 
from the town, but the recurring prospect of pecu- 
niary distress. His health likewise had suffered a 
severe shock from his second paralytic attack ; and 
before the close of this year he was afilicted by ano- 
ther, though sUghter one. Indeed, the derangement 
of his health appeared always to keep pace with 
that of his afiairs, which were now almost as bad 
as ever. 

Either the sum raised by Mr. Armstrong amongst 
his friends was not sufficient to clear him of all his 
debts, or the one hundred and twenty pounds per 
anniun then promised by them had not been punc- 
tually remitted ; for the sum due to that individual 
was now upwards of two hundred pounds, and six 
months' board and lodging were owing at the hotel. 
His wardrobe also had become so diminished, that 
he was glad to accept half a dozen shirts from Mr. 



168 THE LIFE OF 

Armstrong, who had now, as heretofore, the sole 
management of his affairs. 

These debts were reduced, from time to time, by- 
occasional remittances from England, and the fol- 
lowing note was written to acknowledge the receipt 
of one from Lord Alvanley. The kind and hu- 
mane conduct of this nobleman to his now poverty- 
stricken and exiled friend, is deserving of the highest 
eulogium. His patience and generosity were un- 
failing ; and, though certainly no millionaire himself, 
he contrived nevertheless to alleviate his distress to 
the last hour of his existence. In one of his letters 
to Mr. Armstrong, which contained a cheque, are 
these words : *' I beg that you will protect and assist 
poor Brummell, and rely on my making it good to 
you." But to the Beau's letter, which, in spite of 
his destitution, terminates with a joke on himself. 

My dear Alvanley, 

I have examined Armstrong's account of expen- 
diture and receipts for me during the last twelve 
months, and I find it in every respect accurate and 

just. I have delivered to him the halves of the 

and Bank of England notes ; but, alas ! my dear 

fellow, this will provide but in a very trifling degree 
for the liquidation of what I owe for my humble 



GEOtlOE BRUMMELL. 169 

support during the last year, and during the present 
instance **********. I am 
suffering from a most severe and apparently fixed 
rheumatism in my leg, and I am in dread lest I 
should be compelled to have recourse to crutches 
for the rest of my ill-starred days. 

My old friend, King Allen, promised, at least 
it was so represented to me, to send me some 
habiliments for my body, denuded like a new- 
born infant — and .what a Beau I once was ! 

Ever most truly yours. 

The Lord Alvanley, GeoRGE BruMMELL.

There is an anecdote connected with the sobri- 

quet attached to Lord A n, which should not 

be omitted here. It is said, that after living as 
sumptuously as a '* King,'' he was obliged to com- 
pound with his creditors for ten shiUings in the

For, "dearest," in its common sense. 

Means her one loves the hest.

And squeamish in a crowd, 
With prim reproach, you scoff* d the name, 

Because — 'twas said aloud. 

Ah ! many a year has run its race, 

And many a lover too, 
Since blush of youth adom'd that face, 

And flattering words were true. 

Thought you that I, grown old in guile, 

With faded looks was taken ; 
And sought to gain a treacherous smile, 

By others long forsaken ?

No, no, 't would reason's self abuse, 

Immaculate Miss Pawlter, 
With you to weave a tender noose — 

That noose would be a baiter ! 

Qood nigbt ! but since a thoughtless joke, 

An idle fib, could fret you, 
Believe me, if the truth I spoke. 

You'd curse the hour I met you. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

Brummeirs young Mend leaves Caen for England — Farewell letters to her 
— His advice to her on the choice of her society — A compliment spoiled 
by its sincerity — Condoles with the truant lady on the dulness of her 
rural companions — His banker at Calais takes proceedings against him 
— The Hdtel d'Angleterre in a state of siege — Poor Brummell lodged in 
jail — His first note after that event. 

Early in the spring of 1835, Brummeirs fa- 
vourite correspondent went to England ; and to 
this lady, before her departure, the next letter was 
addressed. He was extremely partial to her; nor 
was this extraordinary : in amiability of disposition 
she had no superior, and there were few amongst 
the debutantes of Caen who possessed greater per- 
sonal attractions, none who had more naivete or 
playful talent for' repartee. The latter qualification 
did not fail to win from him much more attention 
than he usually bestowed on girls of her age, for 
she was very young ; but, as I have before said, he 
always preferred the society of the more youthful 
of either sex, to that of his own contemporaries. 
Though bearing respectively the characters of May 
and December, which the old song assures us, 

** Can never, can never agree ;'*

the winter of his life seemed to harmonize admir- 
ably with the early spring of hers, and they were 
the best of friends. It was to this lady that he 
presented his album, and other relics of former 
days. 

Thursday. 

You are going away. It is a melancholy reflec- 
tion for me that this is probably the last time I 
shall ever again write to you. Some day, per- 
haps, ere long, you will read more of me, with 
the rest of the world who may give themselves 
the trouble. 

Our acquaintance has been destined to a limited 
probation; but had it been for years I could not better 
estimate all your many amiable perfections, or more 
sensibly deplore your absence. If I can, at any 
time or under any circumstances, be of the remotest 
service to you, either in England or elsewhere, I 
will humbly request you to remember, that the 
same zealous interest towards you which has always 
influenced me, will remain undiminished to the 
end of my life. 

There are two drawings before me dedicated to 
your album, with which I proceed alternately ; but, 
alas! too slowly — they will not, I fear, be acheve 
before your departure : I am anxious they should 
be well finished, and deserving of their destination,

and dense, and they will be more gloomy when you 
are away, and my fading vision will not allow me cL 
travaitter by the taper's light. If they are not ready 
by Wednesday, they shall be faithfully transmitted 
to you bj * * * *, or through any other channel you 
may indicate. 

Farewell^ my protegee. May Heaven, in its kindest 
mercy, make you happy ! I pray you will sometimes 
read the lines on that depressing word, which are 
in my album : they are a faithful transcript of my 
feelings. Once more, Adieu ! 

G. B. 

A Mademoiselle — — , 
Rue . 

The following are the stanzas to which Brum- 
mell here alludes : — 

ON THE WORD " FAREWELL." 

Thou cruel word, whose magic power 
Of pleasure cheats that precious hour, 
Which, doubly dear to parting friends, 
Too swiftly flies, — too quickly ends. 
Parent of sighs, what sorrows swell 
The breaking heart that bids farewell ! 

What shivering chilness thrills the frame, 
When, by the taper's glimmering flame 
We rise, and hail with grief the day 
Which bears us from our friends away ; 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 175 

Where all our dearest pleasures dwell, 
Pleasures we now must bid farewell ! 

Then the full heart attempts to say- 
Ten thousand things that die away, 
Unheard, upon the faltering tongue ; — 
Then o'er our weakened nerves a throng 
Of fears, ill-boding, wildly tell. 
We may for ever bid farewell ! 

Let those whose hearts have learn*d to glow 
With warm affections, teach me how 
To paint the tumult of the soul. 
When heavy wheels, with sullen roll. 
Of joy departed sound the knell. 
And bid us take a last farewell ! 

From each pale cheek the colours fly, 
Tears tremble in each swimiping eye ; 
By turns each offer 'd hand we grasp, 
By turns each much- loved friend we clasp ; 
Whilst bursting sigfi^s too plainly tell 
The anguish of a long farewell. 

But if you *ve shared the Wanderer's pain. 
Pity the wretched who remain : 
Fix'd on the lessening wheels they gaze ; 
Watch where the road, with winding maze. 
Conducts them near yon opening dell — 
Then, weeping, sigh once more, Farewell ! 

Yet ah ! where'er they turn their eyes. 
Some fond remembrance seems to rise ; 
The vacant chairs can e*en impart 
A poignant sorrow to the heart ; ' 
Still on their ears the voices dwell 
Which lately sigh'd a sad farewell ! 



176 THE LIFE OF 

At length the long, long day is pass'd, 
And gentle evening comes at last ; 
How simple wonder oft beguiles 
The lingering hour ! how many miles 
The weary travellers may tell, 
Since they at daybreak bid farewell ! 

But, soothed by evening's peaceful calm, 
^New life, new hopes, their bosoms warm ; 
Fair truth unfolds the instructive pag^ 
• Her precepts every grief assuage. 
Whilst of a brighter world they tell. 
Where they no more shall bid farewell ! 

As there is nothing to record for the next three 
months, I shall proceed to lay before the reader 
another letter written to this lady before her depar- 
ture, and two during her absence. 

Caen, March, 1835. 

Inclosed I send you letters, if you should wish 
to have recourse to them during your sejour at 

. I have taken the liberty to mention in them 

the name of * * * *. The persons to whom they are 
addressed are two of my oldest friends, high in their 
office at Court; and I will be responsible, that 
through their mediation you will be favourably 
received in the quarter to which they will present 
you. 

I will not now attempt to advert to the resources 
of another and gayer sphere of life to you — the time

de sa souvenance anything that may be ennuyeux, one 
may persuade oneself that new scenes, and faces, 
and voices, may in some measure contribute to dis- 
sipate more melancholy thoughts, and the domestic 
gloom of long evenings at this period of the year ; 
and you may always avail yourself of the oppor- 
tunity I have the pleasure to offer you. 

In the progress of time you will visit London, 
and I have ajrfeady told * * * * of the gratification 
I should derive from being the humble means of 
introducing you to some o( those exalted female 
coryphees who still control what is termed the 
fashionable world: to those among them who 
deserve to know you, and may be of service to 
you, I will equally answer for their attention to 
you and * * * *. In this remote place I am appa- 
rently sequestered and estranged from those with 
whom my former life was intimately connected ; 
but I am neither forgotten nor neglected by them. 
Should you enter into society, let it be confined 
to the best part ; no other is worthy of the most 
distant connaissance ; and to the best alone would 
I venture to recommend you. I am afraid that

My nerves are too shattered, and my rheumatism

I mourn your departure, and cannot more truly

Petrarch : — 

O giorno, o ora, o ultimo momento,

By the next letter it would seem that the young 
absentee did not find English country life so suited 
to her taste as the winter gaieties of a French 
town, in which she had been entirely brought up, 
and Brummell condoles with her accordingly. The 
air of her native land, however, did not disagree 
with her ; but the hearty description given of her 
healthy appearance by the naval chaplain, who was 
the bearer of a missive from her to Brummell, seems 
sadly to have shocked the Beau's refined ideas, and 
he warmly expresses his disapprobation. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 179 

April, 1835. 

For more than a month I have not heard a word 
from you ; it is a disheartening lesson experience 
has long since taught me, that memories left to 
themselves, in absence soon fade away. 

The prophet G****, who seems to embellish 
material as well as spiritual subjects, tells me you 
are looking *' charmingly well!" Quelle gaucherie 
de sentiment ! I was not inquiring after the cherry- 
ripe cheeks of Lady * * * * 'g dairy-maid ! I will, 
however, forgive the familiar barbarism of his 
phraseology : he has navigated back with such a 
redundant glow of freshness in his sainted face, 
that he may well dispense a liberal portion of the 
deodand to you ; still he should identify you with 
more considerate reverence and becoming grace to 
the refined ears of those who are anxious about you 
— but what can one expect from a " true English- 
man?" 

I condole with you upon your meagre (licit of 

reason at Park. Exclusive discussions upon 

animals, agriculture, and politics, are sorry ulitrunits 
for your *' elegant sensibilities!" A dog, indeed, 
or a horse, casually mentioned, might en panHftnt 
be venial — the one recalling to you the abscuit 
moan of the faithful Gyp, the other a sumriK'r'H

There certainly exist de nos compatriotes of my 
nearer acquaintance, who are gifted with the happy 
tact, to make themselves agreeable, without de- 
scending to the abominations of which you com- 
plain. If their livelier senses are not in decline, I 
wish they were around you. London is now in its 
zenith, and they are of course flourishing in its 
favours ; it is the sphere of their local homage, 
their hearts being generally tenfold entangled at 
this period ; and from the mere on dit of a retired 
hermit, they would be loth to leave the fragrance of 
its incense, for the remoter purity of sea-breezes, at 
least till the dream of the season is over ! With all 
my panegyric of you, the attempt might therefore 
be arduous to convoke a few en pelerin to your

traiture of a person much distinguished by your 
partiality.

To Miss , G. B. 

— • Park, Sussex. 

Ten days after Brummell had penned this letter, 
he was visited by a misfortune infinitely more se- 
vere than any he had yet suffered. When the 
consulate at Caen was abolished, of course all hope 
of paying M. Leveux was at an end, unless, indeed, 
some other appointment should enable him to do 
so : this was improbable in the extreme ; and as 
the chances of success in his endeavour to get one 
became more remote, and his health more indif- 
ferent, Mr. Leveux, or his partners, determined 
upon arresting him. The proceeding was rather 
a severe one ; for he had strictly fulfilled the en- 
gagement he entered into, on receiving the money 



182 THE LIFB OP 

in question from Mr. Leveux, until the Govern- 
ment deprived him of the power of so doing. 

From this time, his creditors had no security 
or shadow of one, and they probably calculated 
that if Brummell was once in jail, his friends 
would come forward and pay the debt. The pre- 
liminary steps therefore were taken, and early one 
morning in May, 1835, the H6tel d'Angleterre was 
surrounded by gens d'armes, who were unusually 
numerous for an occasion of the kind ; certainly 
more so than was necessary to secure the person 
of a rheumatic and paralysed old man: some per- 
sons said it was intended as a compliment to the 
official situation he had formerly held ; at all events, 
the French were agreed in thinking that no debtor 
in the town of Caen had ever been so hand- 
somely arrested. While the subordinates Uned the 
gateway and back entrance, and cut off all chance 
of escape, the juge-de-paix, taking a couple of them 
with him, ascended the staircase that led to Brum- 
melPs apartments ; they then passed through the 
salon, entered his bed-room without giving the 
slightest notice, and at once surrounded his bed. 

The poor Beau was asleep, but the rough grasp 
of one of the jack-booted gentlemen soon aroused 
him from his slumbers, and he awoke to find him- 
self in the hands of justice. If at first he thought 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 183 

it was only a horrid dream, he was soon undeceived 
by the huissier, who produced a writ of arrest, at the 
suit of Mr. Leveux, for fifteen thousand francs, and 
bluntly informed him, that he must go to prison 
unless he could pay that sum. His agitation at 
this summons was extreme, and on the entrance 
of the waiter, who now made his appearance, he 
was totally overcome, and gave way to a burst of 
grief — the remainder of the scene was of the same 
distressing character. Being ordered to dress, he 
begged that he might be left alone, for a few 
minutes, to do so : but this favour was refused, and 
he was obliged to get out of bed, and slip on his 
clothes before the intruders. Those who knew 
Brummell, may imagine what an effect this must 
have had upon his vanity and refinement ; but 
there was no help for it, and, perhaps for the 
first time in his life, he was under the necessity 
of dressing in a hurry. 

In the mean time, the landlord had despatched 
a servant to several of his friends to acquaint 
them of his arrest; but the sum was so large, 
that any kind intervention on their part was im- 
possible. This he was well aware of himself, and 
therefore sent for a coach to take him to the pri- 
son, which he had not enough money in the house 
to pay for: he also requested the attendance of 



184 THE LIFE OF 

his landlady, and entreated her to take especial 
care of all his papers. " They are," said he, 
** the only things I possess to which I attach par- 
ticular value, they are of no use to any one else, 
maispour moiy Madame Ftchety ils sont un vrai tr^or ; 
when I am gone, pray collect them, and lock them 
up with your own hands." The fiacre was now 
announced, and two gens d'armes and the huis- 
sier having entered it with him, they were soon 
at their destination. On his arrival there, he was 
locked up in a place, it cannot be called a room, 
with the common prisoners, for there was no se- 
parate apartment to be had. The floor of this 
den was of stone, and the furniture consisted only 
of the three truckle-beds of his companions ; as to 
chairs, there were none, but one was brought in 
for his use. The next day he sent the following 
note to a friend ; it had been hastily written with 
a pencil, and was scarcely legible. 

In Prison, 5th May, 1835. 
I still breathe, though I am not of the living — 
the state of utter abstraction in which I have 
been during the last thirty hours, yet clouds my 
every sense. I have just received your note — may 
Heaven bless you all for your good devotedness 
in remembering me at such a moment. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 185 

I have been the victim of a villain, who has 
closed upon me, without giving me the remotest 
intimation of his designs. I am perfectly innocent 
of any thing bearing the least dishonourable con- 
struction in this malheureuse affaire ; and if I was 
not deserving of the interest you express as well 
as * * * * towards me, I would not demand it. 

I will write to you when I can. 

Ever most sincerely yours, 

A Madame , G. B. 

Rue , 



CHAPTER XV. 

Effects of his imprisoDment — ^Difficulty of procaring moderate accommoda- 
tion — Rules of the jail — ^Treatment of the prisoners — ^The situation and 
description of his room — His companion in misfortune — Letters to his 
friends in the town — The ruling passion — Letter to Mr. Armstrong — 
BrummeU's miserable fare — His urgent application for more linen. 

It is not surprising that Brummell should inveigh 
thus bitterly against the author of his misfortune, 
for in this business he was decidedly much less to 
blame than he had been in any other transaction con- 
nected with money matters. He had done all he 
could to settle the debt, and it would have been can- 
celled in due course of time had he not been deprived 
of his consulate. At first he was deeply affected by 
his arrest, and gave way for several days to violent 
paroxysms of grief. The morning after his incarce- 
ration one of his friends, who had just heard of his 
calamity, went to see him ; and as he entered the 
apartment poor Brummell threw himself into his 
arms and sobbed like a child, exclaiming, in broken 
sentences, ** Imagine a position more wretched than 
mine, — they have put me with all the common people. 
I am surrounded by the greatest villains, and have 



THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 187 

nothing but prison fare." He was in fact for some 
days in a state of weakness perfectly childish. But 
this deplorable incapability of meeting his misfor- 
tunes with a proper degree of resolution is no matter 
of reproach or astonishment in an elderly man, who 
had recently suffered from two attacks of paralysis, 
which had completely undermined his nervous 
system ; and many of his acquaintance feared that 
his imprisonment would inevitably bring on another 
and fatal one. 

The day subsequent to that on which he was 
committed to prison his friends, both French and 
English, exerted themselves to the utmost to oblain 
for him the indulgence of a private room ; but the 
jail being very full at the time, they unfortunately 
failed to accomplish their good intentions. Through 
the interest, however, made by one of the judges, 
also an acquaintance of Brummell's, he was after- 
wards permitted to share during the day the apart- 
ment of a Monsieur Godefroi, the responsible editor 
of the Ami de la VSrite, (a legitimist paper pub- 
lished in the town,) who was confined for a political 
offence. At night he slept in a narrow passage 
{couloir) communicating with another ])art of the 
prison, which was now rarely used. It is true that 
this passage was only a few inches wider than his 
bed, but it was a little paradise coini)Hrcd with the 



188 THE LIFE OF 

common room ; here, however, he remained, until 
his friend the judge exerted his influence, obliged to 
associate not only with the debtors, but with felons, 
who before conviction are permitted to purchase the 
indulgences of ''the Pistole:" in this part of the 
prison a bed, the use of the debtors* court, and other 
advantages, are obtained upon paying certain fees, 
amounting, in former days, to a pistole — thence the 
term. 

This system of mixing the debtors with crimi- 
nals who may be, and frequently are, condenmed 
to the galleys for life, does not speak well for the 
discipline of French prisons. In other respects, 
the jail seemed to be in good order, and Monsieur 
Godefroi, who was kind enough to accompany me, 
when I went there in the spring of 1843, to see 
Brummell's room, said that great ameliorations 
had taken place within the last four years. The 
cells, however, in which refractory prisoners are 
confined at the mandate of the governor, appeared 
damp, dark, and dreadfully small : in one of them, 
and on a little loose straw thrown upon the ground, 
we saw one of these unfortunates lying. In these 
dungeons, the prisoners condemned to death are 
also placed after their trial, and here they learn 
the result of their last appeal to human clemency. 
Two, and even three months, sometimes elapse 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 189 

before the decision of the Cour de Cassation is pro- 
mulgated ; and during this long period of protracted 
misery, the criminal, with a chain of sixteen pounds 
weight, is attached to a staple in the wall ; nor does 
he ever move one foot from the spot, until he is led 
forth to meet his doom. 

The view from the window of Brummell's nar- 
row little dormitory was not a very cheering one ; 
through the bars and to the left, was the court- 
yard of the female prisoners, who were generally 
to be seen plying their distaffs ; but there was lit- 
tle attractive in their countenances, and still less 
in their conversation : in front was the yard and 
diminutive garden of the Pistole, and farther to 
the right, that called la Paille, from the material 
on which the prisoners sleep, in contradistinction 
to the wool-bed of the former. Beyond this was 
the exterior wall of the prison, the roofs of the 
houses in the Quartier St. Martin, and the tops 
of a few lime-trees in that part of the town. The 
sight of a httle verdure, and more genial air than 
that in the rooms below, and above all, the power 
of being at his pleasure completely isolated from the 
other prisoners, did not quite compensate Brum- 
mell for being obliged to ascend and descend some 
forty stone steps ; and, from the first day he inha- 
bited it, to that on which he found that he could not 



190 THR LIFE OF 

be allowed permission to take up his abode at the 
hospital, he was always complaining of his quarters. 

The room of his fellow-prisoner, Monsieur Gode- 
froi, which was larger, and on the first story, was 
gained by the same staircase as that which led to 
Brummell's, the approach to it being by a dark nar- 
row corridor, closed by three doors. Though this 
apartment had the same aspect as that which I have 
just described, it was considered the best room in 
the prison : from it the prisoners condemned to the 
galleys were to be seen promenading, and the fol- 
lowing inscriptions, engraved on the walls, were 
not calculated to cheer those whom they encircled : 
*' O quam metuendus est locus iste ! " — " Plut6t 
mourir que de vivre ici" — " Cave tibi : hie muri 
aures habent, et audiunt " — and others in a similar 
strain. The latter was particularly applicable to 
this apartment, for it was next to the ward in which 
the greatest criminals were confined, (those who 
had been condemned to the bagnCy or were await- 
ing a sentence scarcely more horrible, — that of 
death ;) and the large blocks of freestone of which 
the party-wall was built, acting as a conductor to 
the various sounds in the adjacent apartment, much 
of what passed in it could be distinguished. 

Accordingly, when evening had closed in, and 
Brummell and his companion were locked up 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 191 

and left to their meditations, they could distinctly 
hear the imprecations of the prisoners, the clanking 
of their fetters, their uproarious mirth, and obscene 
songs. Many a time the poHtical prisoner, who was 
confined here for three years, was startled from his 
slumbers by the yells of his lawless and riotous 
neighbours ; and Brummell, during his short impri- 
sonment of three months, when taking his after-din- 
ner nap by the fire, was sometimes suddenly roused 
by their execrations and oaths. 

It may appear singular that he should have had 
a fire in the summer months of June and July, 
which were this year oppressively hot, so much so, 
that the springs were dried up, and the Orne was 
fordable at several points ; but Brummell delighted 
in heat, and Monsieur Godefroi remarked that he 
invariably drew as near to the fire as possible after 
dinner, and remained a long time before it, employed 
in rubbing his legs with his hands : which was, in 
his opinion, the most efficacious method of alleviat- 
ing his rheumatic pains. 

It would be quite unpardonable, if, in this at- 
tempt at biography, I did not make an opportunity 
for extracting a passage from Pelham, and the 
following allusion to BrummeU's extreme love of 
caloric is the best I can select, being, as it is, the 
only point on which he admitted that the character 



192 THE LIFE OF 

of Russelton the " grossest of caricatures " (as he 
used to term it) at all resembled him — his heart was 
never softened by the apologetic note in the second 
edition. " It was/' says Pelham, who pays him a 
visit on his way through Calais, " a very small 
room in which I found him ; he was stretched in 
an easy chair before the fire-place, gazing compla- 
cently at his feet, and apparently occupied in any- 
thing but listening to Sir Willoughby Townshend, 
who was talking with great vehemence about po- 
litics and the corn-laws. Notwithstanding the heat 
of the weather, there was a small fire on the hearth, 
which, aided by the earnestness to convince his 
host, put poor Sir Willoughby into a most intense 
perspiration. Russelton, however, seemed enviably 
cool, and hung over the burning wood, Uke a cu- 
cumber on a hotbed.* Sir Willoughby came to 
a full stop by the window, and (gasping for breath) 
attempted to throw it open. 

" * What are you doing ? for heaven's sake, what 
are you doing ?' cried Russelton, starting up, ' do 
you mean to kill me?' 

" * Kill you !' said Sir Willoughby, quite aghast. 

" * Yes, kill me ! is it not quite cold enough al- 
ready, in this d — d seafaring place, without making

them. — Printer* s devil !

my miserable existence at one blow, by opening 
that abominable lattice? Do you think, because 
your great frame, fresh from the Yorkshire wolds, 
and compacted of such materials, that one would 
think, in eating your beeves, you had digested their 
hides into skin — do you think, because your limbs 
might be cut up into planks for a seventy-eight, and 
warranted water-proof without pitch, because of the 
density of their pores — do you think, because 
you are as impervious as an araphorostic shoe, 
that I, John Russelton, am equally impenetrable, 
and that you are to let easterly winds play about 
my room .like children, begetting rheums and asth- 
mas, and all manner of catarrhs ? I do beg. Sir 
Willoughby Townshend, that you will allow me to die 
a more natural and civilized death ;' and so saying, 
Russelton sank down into his chair, apparently in 
the last stage of exhaustion." 

For the first fortnight after Brummell was com- 
mitted to prison, he had some hope that his deten- 
tion would be only temporary, and that he would 
eventually be removed to the General and Military 
Hospital, at the Abbaye aux Dames, in the church

of our first William. There, though under equally 
strict surveillance J he would have had every comfort. 
A passage in the following letter shows how anxi- 
ously he dwelt upon the hope of his application 
being successful ; it was written about a week after 
his arrest. 

Tn Prison, May 1 1 • 

The kindness of every human being within the 
sphere of my acquaintance in this town has by 
degrees restored me to equanimity. How shall I 
be able to repay you for this benevolence? De- 
voutly I thank you for the Student; it will be 
an early resource to me. I am, I believe, this even- 
ing to be transferred from my present den of thieves 
to the towers of Matilda, and to the sainted arms 
of les sceurs de Charite\ There I shall again breathe 
fresh air, and be comparatively in peace. I cannot 
describe to you what I have suffered here. 

H * * * *, in the frequent moments I have seen him 
since his return, has felt and acted towards me with 
the affection of a brother. I cannot to-day trust 
myself further in writing to you ; remembrances of 
you and those who belong to you will crowd upon 
my thoughts, and I might relapse into my recent 
imbecilities by the endeavour. Adieu ! Persevere 
in all your exceUing goodness towards me. It may

please Providence to guide the hearts of those who 
once better knew me to imitate your kindness. 

Ever sincerely yours,

P.S. You will perceive the extremities to which 
I am reduced — I am about to seal to you with a 
wafer ! Do not even whisper this indecorum, for 
perhaps I may again frequent the world.

were, I think, the dying words of the pedant and 
inveterate grammarian — the Beau, in the very depths 
of his misery and despair, (for there had been no 
time to ascertain what assistance he was likely to 
receive from England,) also exhibited in this post- 
script the ruUng passion in full force — " I may 
again frequent the world." Poor man! it was a 
world that would have never perceived the delin- 
quency, and one that he must have felt he was soon 
to leave for ever. This passion was indeed para- 
mount amidst all his distress; and the reader will 
scarcely be surprised when I inform him that the 
first thing he asked for, after his grief had some-

what subsided, was a looking-glass. The young 
Frenchman indicated by the initial in the previous 
letter, gave him the means of purchasing one, for 
he had no money ; and the kindness oP his friend 
continued uninterrupted till he was liberated. The 
following letter will show how great his anxieties 
were on these trifling matters, and that to add to 
his other misfortunes, he was in a fair way of being 
starved. 

In Prison, Saturday. 

Dear Armstrong, 

Henri de St. Marie told me yesterday you had 
sent me a bottle of Esprit de Savon.— I have never 
received it. 

If it has been left to Bassy, the chemist, to send, 
of course I shall never see it ; should it have been 
remitted for conveyance to the hotel, equal negli- 
gence will attend its destiny. In spite of all my 
friends have said to them in expostulation of the 
shameful pitifulness of the morsel they send to me 
by way of dinner, they get daily more meagre and 
miserable, and it is really not sufficient for the poor 
cat that keeps me company, neither does it, arrive 
before half-past six, malgr^ your orders to them. 
I cannot help telling you what was the banquet 
yesterday dispatched to me. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 197 

One solitary chop, about the size of an ecu, en- 
veloped in a quire of greasy paper, and the skeleton 
of a pigeon, a bird I could never fancy.* I must 
not omit to mention the accompaniment of half a 
dozen potatoes. Such was my meal of yesterday 
evening, after a fast of twelve hours. It is not, I 
am certain, the fault of the son, but the ladrerie of 
the pere et mere, with which I have been so long 
acquainted. If they transmit me nothing more 
solid and bountiful this evening, I shall be reduced 
to borrow a tranche of the bouilli from which the 
soupe maigre of my neighbours the brigands is ex- 
tracted. I have not seen a soul to-day. I have no 
news, and I am in the very slough of despondency. 

Yours, 

G. B.

Rue St. Jean. 

Though Brummell had lived for so many years 
m France, it will scarcely be thought extraordi- 
nary, that he should have been ignorant of the 
component parts of soupe maigre; it was a dish 
too ordinary for him to have known otherwise 
than by name; had his conversion to Roman-

to death at Cheveley. Chap. VI. Vol. I.

ism at Calais been sincere — and it was as sincere 
as his intention to subscribe to the erection of 
the Protestant Church there — ^he would have 
learnt, and to his sorrow, that this foreign luxury- 
is not made of meat. 

The expostulations of his homme d'affaires ap- 
pears by another letter to that person, to have 
had, at least for a few days, some effect ; but even 
his remonstrances failed to produce a cutlet suffi- 
ciently good to remind him of his Sevres portrait 
of La Maintenon. 

In Prison, Monday. 

My dear Armstrong, 

Many thanks for your unremitting kindness in 
improving the quality of my humble repast. To 
your good offices, I had yesterday the satisfaction 
of being indebted for a sufficient, though homely 
dinner. 

I have sent to you two servietteSy which I had 
neglected, belonging to the H6tel d'Angleterre ; 
they are the last remaining in my possession 
from that quarter. You will much oblige me, by 
sending to me to-day, three towels for my toilette ; 
and the same number every six days, for I cannot 
procure even a clout to rub myself down in this 
nauseous place. You will not, I am sure, forget 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 199 

either, that every three days it is incumbent on 
me to pay for the necessities of breakfast, eau-de- 
vie, candles, &c., — while you are here or during 
your absence. 

I wiU beg you carefiilly to take charge of every- 
thing I left behind me at the hotel, particularly 
two boxes ; the one mahogany with brass ribs, and 
G. B, on a plate at the top — the other with a 
glass on the top, covering worked birds drinking 
out of a vase ; it was the labour and gift of the 
late Duchess of York, and I have a reverence 
for it — the latter has a leather case, which is 
either in the cupboard of the armoire out of the 
sitting-room, or in the other recess where you 
will find my trunks, &c., &c. Pray send me what 
remains in the drawers of the bed-room — there 
are some waistcoats, drawers, pantaloons, &c., and 
in the upper tiroivj sundry trifling things which 
I forgot, but which I may have occasion for. 
The clock, vases, brown candlesticks, and in short 
everything in the room, is my own, not omit- 
ting the old green velvet arm-chair. There is one 
insignificant article which I also wish you would 
transmit to me; it is under the small commode 
in the sitting-room, with a white marble-slab 
on the top, (which also belongs to me,) and of 
which I am every evening in want, a boot-jack

that shuts up. Let the large basin and water-jug 
he taken great care of. 

This is all that I can recollect — ^perhaps there 
may be other trifles in the armoire, adjoining the 
sitting-room, which at the instant escape my me- 
mory ; let them be preserved. 

Enclosed, I deliver to you a list of every debt 
which I owe in this country of France, you will 
have the goodness to add your own just and excellent 
claims upon me, and those due to the hotel — those 
in the list to whose names I have attached a cross, 
I am ignorant of the precise amount of their re- 
maining claims upon me ; you can easily ascertain 
them. Beyond these, so help me Heaven, I*have 
not an existing debt, either in my hand writing, or 

by oral promise, in this country. Young B 

is waiting below to carry my letter; therefore, I 
can only add, my dear Armstrong, how very sin- 
cerely, 

I am yours,

Though Bruinmeirs position was truly distressing, 
from the blow given to his pride, and from the 
want of good accommodation and viands ; and though 
the countenances of the felons under his window 
were not pleasant objects for daily contemplation, 
the many disagreeables that he experienced in the 
early part of his imprisonment were far less annoy- 
ing to his feelings than the absence of his ** jug and 
basin," his dentist's mirror, his tweezers, and his 
silver shaving and expectorating dish. The loss of 
these articles of his toilette, his soaps, pommadesy 
and eau de Cologne, affected him deeply ; and, until 
these " comestibles," as he termed them, were re- 
stored to him, he had some difficulty in tranquil- 
lizing himself. 

The preceding notes show that his dinner also 
always remained a subject of grief : it was composed, 



202 THE LIFE OF 

said M. Godefroi, of ** trois ou quatre petits plats 
varies, et un leger dessert. II ^tait presque toujours 
mecontent de la quantity et de la quality des mets ; 
il accusait rimp^ritie ou la m^moire infid^le du chef 
de cuisine ; k qui il avait toujours soin de se faire 
recommander : * Le bourreau/ disait-il, * veut-il 
done m'empoisonner ou me faire mourir de faim f 
A handsome black cat, however, belonging to his 
companion in misfortime, grew fat upon Brum- 
mell's leavings ; to this Minette, one of the thou- 
sand of the same name in the town of Caen, he 
would sometimes throw a whole cutlet, forgetting 
how many persons there were under the same roof 
with him, who would have been glad to receive it ; 
a little brandy-and-water at his dinner, and coffee 
and chasse afterwards, closed the repast. But, as 
I have before said, he regretted his good and Hberal 
dinners at the table d^hSte of the H6tel d'Angle- 
terre, far less than any article of dress or toilette, 
which was necessary to his rigid ideas of cleanli- 
ness, or that tended in any way to render perfect 
his outward appearance. 

*' Ilconsacrait," said Grodefroi, ** trois heures k 
sa toilette, dont tous les details ^taient soignes 
avec une attention extreme." " Mais, monsieur, he 
actually washed and shaved every day," was the 
Editor's expression ; as if these two actions were 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 203 

unnecessary as a daily practice ; but I will give the 
astonished Frenchman's own words on this subject : 
— *' II se rasait chaque jour ; chaque jour il faisait une 
ablution complete de toutes les parties de son corps, 
k I'aide de la vaste cuvette d'un antique lavabo 
qui I'avait suivi en prison, aussi une cassette (dress- 
ing-case) rempli de phioles d'essences et de cos- 
metiques. Pour cette operation de propret^, inouie 
dans les fastes de la prison, douze h quinze litres 
d'eau et deux litres de lait lui ^taient r^guli^re- 
ment apportfe,* par son valet de chambre, son 
Lafleur ; c'est ainsi qu'il nommait plaisamment 
Tancien tambour de ligne, Paul Lupine, qui, en ce 
moment prisonnier civil, ^tait k son service et ^ 
sa solde. Ce brave, qui venait de finir son service 

* I had at first some hesitation in believing this ; but M. 
Godefroi assured me the statement was perfectly true. In this 
absurd caprice Brummell imitated the last Duke of Queens- 
berry, who is also said to have bathed his impure person in 
milk ! Some have considered the story fabulous ; still there are 
many persons living who remember the great prejudice against 
drinking milk which once prevailed in the metropolis, in conse- 
quence of its being supposed, that this necessary of life might 
have been retailed from the daily lavations of that nobleman. 
But the Beau's prodigal misuse of two quarts of milk per diem 
bears no comparison to the Empress Poppaea's more refined habit 
of immersing herself in ass's milk. Five hundred of these animals 
are said to have been milked daily, to minister to her luxurious 
vanity ; and when banished from Rome fifty asses attended her.

exploits commis dans un cabaret de sa patrie, passer

" Leste et fort, le tambour Lupine ne regrettait 
pas I'eau necessaire k Monsieur Brummell; I'eau 
insipide, I'eau qui ne coAte rien, mais il n'^tait pas 
de m^me du blanc et doux liquide ; il n'en avait 
jamais vu faire un pareil usage, et le prix de ces 
deux litres de lait eAt €i€ si avantageusement con- 
verti en un bon verre d'eau-de-vie ! Cette perte 
est encore," continued M. Godefroi, '* sur le cceur 
du tambour Lupine, qui n'en a pas moins vers^ une 
larme sur le bon M. Brummell en apprenant sa 
triste fin." 

The want of punctuality in the arrival of his 
dinner, which the Beau complains of in his letter to 
Mr. Armstrong, was rectified by the kind attention 
of a friend, who allowed his servant to carry it to 
the prison every day at the appointed hour. The 
following note was written in acknowledgment of 
this and other little services. 

In Prison, Tuesday. 

Most earnestly I thank you for your amiable 
hillet. Seldom I forget kindnesses ; but my grateful 
remembrance of yours will survive to the end of 
my destined days. D * * * * should have answered 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 205 

my last note ; it would have been a consolation to 
me in these hours of wretchedness. 

Your valet has quite won me by ses petits soins 
in administering to my lingering vegetation at half- 
past five. The good-humoured luckless brigand, 
who acts as my Frontin, and who receives my 
diurnal portion through la grille, is proud of his 
connahsance, and flatters him by saying, " C'est 
un bon diable que ce Figaro Ik !" Godefroi is my 
host ; that is, I partage his more humanized cell, 
excepting during my sleeping hours. Heaven help 
them. 

I try to slumber upon the hope of removal to a 
more salubrious atmosphere and humanized inter- 
course on Monday, k rH6pital. Last night my 
dreams were violently disturbed by the abrupt en- 
trance of all the corps de garde of the prison, who 
were on the alert in consequence of a rapid fire that 
was blazing without the walls, but within thirty 
yards of my cell, and were obliged to pass through 
it, in order to be ready for the approach of the 
flames, or the attempted escape of the detenus. I 
threw on my cloak and followed them. It was 
dreadful, being upon a timber-merchant's premises, 
but magnificent. I remained at a loop-hole gazing 
on the destruction till past two, when it subsided. 
This spectacle caused me a severe rheumatism ; and 



206 THE LIFE OF 

I wish I had slept on, forgetful of my own malheursy 
instead of witnessing those of others. 

Thank you for Zohrab ; I prefer it to Ayesha, 
but neither of them equal Hadji Baba. How can 
I requite all your commiseration and kindness 
towards me ? If it may be any trifling retribution 
I never cease to think of it. 

Most sincerely yours, 

A Madame , G. B. 

Rue ' 

The fire to which Brummell here alludes was so 
very close to the prison, that the sparks and large 
pieces of the charred and burning wood fell in great 
flakes upon the roof. The women's ward being 
the nearest to the flaming timber, the greatest 
danger was apprehended on that side, and the cries 
of its inmates were heard by Brummell in his room. 
When, therefore, the jailor and his turnkeys passed 
through it he followed them up to the garrets, and 
remained at one of the windows watching the pro- 
gress of the flames. 

In returning, however, to his cell, which he did 
alone, the officials being too much occupied to 
attend to him, he got embarrassed by the folds of 
his dressing-gown, and, in the darkness which pre- 
vailed in the garret, managed to entangle himself 
in the washing-lines that were extended across it. 



GEORGB BRUMMELL. 207 

The more he endeavoured to liberate himself, the 
more he became involved, until, finding that his 
efforts to escape were vain, he was at length obliged 
to call lustily for assistance ; but the turnkeys were 
too busy to hear his cries above the din without, 
and he lay in this predicament some considerable 
time before he was unravelled. The next morning, 
when speaking of the adventure of the previous 
night, he said laughingly to Monsieur Godefroi, 
"Monsieur, hier Georges Brumimell a manqu^ de 
finir en Basse Normandie comme un vrai Normand, 
ou comme un vizir. Turc/' 

" Comme un vrai Normand." Brummell here 
alludes to the facile and ready manner in which the 
ends of justice, or injustice, were carried out in 
Normandy during the middle ages, and which 
gained for this province the appellation of " le pays 
de la potence." Roland estabUshed a rural police y 
and hung the hons Normands with little discrimina- 
tion. At one of the towns in Lower Normandy, 
and in the department of the Ome, they used to say, 

" A Domfront, ville de malheur, 
Arrive a midi — pendu a une heure !'* 

The refrain also of one of the anti-legitimist songs 
at the Restoration was, *' Bons Normands, vous 
serez pendus, comme on pendaient vos p^res." 
The next letter is. written in a most mournful

tone, and the lady to whom it was addressed was 
one of those by whose hospitality he says, in his 
letter to Mr. Marshall, he *' profited abundantly." . 

In Prison, Sunday. 

You must believe me when I tell you that my 
senses have not been in an adequate state of com- 
posure to attempt manuscript: I should probably 
have written stark-staring bombast, in the essay to 
express my thanks for all your persevering kind- 
ness; and, even at this instant of comparative 
sanity of mind, I will only trust myself to assure 
you, that, with every worthy feeling that remains 
to me, I do thank you from my heart. 

On the evening of this sacred day it was my 
authorized custom to sit around your fire, and 
endeavour to requite my welcome by making you 
laugh at my nonsense. Most heartily I pray that 
those happy periods may come again, though I 
scarcely dare look into future destiny. 

I try to dissipate the sinister troop of blue devils 
that haunt me, with the hope that I may be allowed 
to be transmigrated, the early part of the week, 
from this den of thieves to the pure atmosphere de 
rH6pital, and to the more delightful intercourse 
of the sceurs de Charite, instead of the contami- 
nation and blasphemy of the felons that surround

me — I am wretched here — I cannot describe the 
nausea of my sensations when I descend in the 
morning from my cell, and, from the grate of the 
window see miserable outcasts dancing and sing- 
ing in chains, with every apparent gaiety of spirit. 

What, in the name of all my faults or in com- 
mon justice from the remembrance of those many 
friends with whom my better years were passed, 
have I evier done to deserve this purgatory ? 

Of all those I have recently known in this 
part of the world, I can only speak with unquali- 
fied praise ; — their attention and good feeling 
towards me surpasses almost example in my recol- 
lection. Still I am lingering in this enfer sur terre^ 
and Providence, I believe, can only tell whether I 
shall ever again transgress its walls alive. 

Very sincerely yours,

The hope of being removed to the General Hos- 
pital, which had hitherto tended to keep up poor 
Brummell's spirits, was entirely frustrated ; for, 
shortly after this letter was written, he learned that 
he was,not to be transferred to the tender sympa- 
thies of the Sisters of Charity, though a requisition 
to that effect had been presented to the authorities.

This application was signed by two medical men ; 
but the request was either refused, or the idea relin- 
quished ; probably the latter, for the officers of 
the Tribunal de Justice were desirous of assist- 
ing him in every possible way, and Mr. Leveux's 
lawyer acceded to the plan immediately it was pro- 
posed. 

This disappointment was alleviated by the repeated 
calls, and continued attentions of his friends ; for he 
had crowds of morning visitors, and habit at length 
partially reconciled him to his fate. Many ladies, 
also, who could not enUven his room by their pre- 
sence, were, nevertheless, as women always are, 
more thoughtful in matters essential to his comfort 
than his own sex, and frequently sent him supplies 
of wine, punch, jelUes, pat^s, and various other deli- 
cacies : these were truly valuable to one on whom 
sickness, anxiety, and premature old age, pressed 
heavily, and who, in spite of their charitable inter- 
ference, must have endured many discomforts and 
privations. The following is a letter of acknow- 
ledgment to one of his guardian angels. 

In Prison, Wednesday. 

You are always good and amiable, but you will 
be the best of beings, if you will have the kind- 
ness to renew your benefaction en forme de gdteau.

I can assure you, it is my principal nourishment, 
for the mesquin repast they usually send me from 
the hotel would not be adequate to sustain even 
a demoiselle lost in love. I may represent an ad- 
ditional claim upon your bounty at this moment : 
my companion Minette, la chatte noire , who is in 
the straw at my feet, having produced three hun- 
gry kittens — her delicate state disdains the un- 
leavened bread of the prison. I have another 
favourite belonging to my more private apartment : 
it is a spider about the size of a bee, which I have 
so far apprivois^e^ that it comes regularly to me from 
its web every morning at seven o'clock to demand 
his d^jeune. You must forgive then my anxiety 
for the sustenance of these familiar friends, as well 
as my own ; they are, perhaps, the only ones that 
will soon remain to me. I am sadly out of sorts with 
the world and "with myself; no propitious tidings 
come to me 1 Nothing cheers me but the occasional 
simbeam that looks in upon me from heaven ; when 
that retires, all is darkness arid despondency. It 
seems to me a century since I have been in this 
intolerable bondage; every week that lingers away 
is a year in the calendar of my life !

His friends also provided against the dreariness 
of his evenings, by catering food for his mind ; and, 
in the basket which carried these presents, were 
generally placed a few volumes of Ught reading : 
they were always thankfully received, and the re- 
ceipt of them duly acknowledged by a note. 

In Prison, Wednesday. 

If the Student had not belonged to you, I 
should not have been able to wade through ten of 
its pages : it is equally barren of incident, defini- 
tion, or plain language, and I can only wonder that 
the author of Eugene Aram, and Pompeii, should 
have buried his brains in such a production — at 
least have published it. When you have again 
something more worthy of cheating miserable hours, 
I know it is unnecessary for me to refer to your 
amiable recollection of my present desolation, and 
you will send it to me. I am still sustained with 
hopes of emancipation from these disgusting regions, 
and, though it is consoling to me to remember the 
kindness of others, I wish to heaven I could forget 
myself. I cannot tell you how much it gratifies me 
to know that your domestique brings my daily bread 
from the hotel : these trifling circumstances do me 
worlds of good at the mopient. Good bye for the 
evening. My friend Godefroi, the editor, from whose 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 213 

table I address you, is looking with anxiety at the 
ink, to continue paragraphs that will probably pro- 
long his detention here ten years longer. He is 
really a good-hearted man, and does every thing

CHAPTER XVII. 

Liberty of the press in France — Not much forwarded by the revolution of 
July — Brummell's admiration of Gilbert Gumey — His opinion of Pompeii 
and Lodore — Contemplations from his window — ^The Beau's anxieties 
about his affairs— The ours Mazoyer — The scene in the passage of the pri- 
son — Personal discomforts — Their effect upon Brummell. 

Poor Godefroi, who, throughout Brummell's 
imprisonment, was a kmd and useful friend, was 
not exactly the editor, but rather the editor's edi- 
tor ; and was hired to do duty as a prisoner when- 
ever the demands of justice, or the administrators 
of it, required that a victim should be offered up to 
the tender mercies of the Government. It is amus- 
ing to observe such happy results emanating from 
the Hberty obtained by the Trois beaux jours ; more 
especially when it is remembered that one of the 
principal causes which led to that revolution, was 
the seizure of the printing-presses of the National^ 
for having dared to differ in opinion from the 
Government of the day. — Godefroi*s master had 
only differed from the Government of July ! 

But with the queer ideas of liberty entertained by 
the French nation, the social policy of their Govern- 



THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 215 

ment is likely enough to be tyrannical in such mat- 
ters for some time to come ; and probably centuries 
will elapse before they will either understand, or 
appreciate, free institutions^ or can be driven safely 
without a curb. 

One day, when I was discussing this subject with 
a Frenchman, and expatiating upon the great extent 
of individual liberty that we enjoy in England, I 
could not refrain from calling his attention to 
Greneral Foy's speeches upon the arbitrary nature 
of passports, when he retorted very seriously by 
saying, *' Oui, Monsieur, mais rappelez-vous que 
vous avez des tumpaiques. " Neither can they 
comprehend how we manage to maintain an army 
without a conscription : — '' Bon jour notre arm^ 
s'il n'y avait pas de tirage," said a conscript to 
me, who had just been drawn ; he was a grocer's 
boy, and appeared much fonder of his master's 
figs than the law which made him an unwilling 
hero, a glory-boy, a recipient of black bread and 
one sous a-day, I believe this lad spoke the real 
sentiments of his class ; although such, I dare 
say, is not the opinion generally entertained in 
England. 

Brummell's criticism on the Student is rather 
severe, and looks as if he had Sneer's to Sir 



216 THE LIFE OF 

Fretful, in his mind. It was no easy task, one 
would imagine, to " cheat miserable hours" like 
his, at any period of his imprisonment, but par- 
ticularly at the commencement ; and, though there 
are few authors who can hope to escape the natu- 
ral consequences of publicly exposing their intel- 
lects, or their want of them, it would be very 
extraordinary to find the exception to the rule in 
one whose pen travels with such Great Western 
rapidity. But Brummell could praise heartily, 
and in a most singular and unequivocal manner. 
A young Englishman of his acquaintance, at Caen, 
found him one morning lying full-length on his 
hearth-rug, as he fancied, in a fit of hysterics ; on 
stooping down, however, to assist him, he saw 
that it was a paroxysm of laughter, and Brummell, 
unable to explain the cause of his mirth in words, 
could only hiccup, while pointing to a book on 
the table, '* Gilbert Gur-ur-ny, — oh ! — oh ! Gilbert 
Gurney." 

The work of Sir L. Bulwer upon which the 
Beau bestowed his especial approbation, was, The 
Last Days of Pompeii : I have heard him speak 
of this in raptures, particularly Glaucus's letter, 
which he thought perfection. When these bor- 
rowed volumes were returned to their owner, they 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 217 

were generally accompanied by a short review, and 
the critique of the next that fell under his perusal, 
and his lash, was more favourable. 

In Prison, Saturday. 

If you knew the many hours that were relieved 
by reading Lodore, you would not be displeased 
at my retaining it so long. The story is, perhaps, 
rather unconnected, but the language is always good, 
exempt from the usual pseudo sentiment of modern 
romances, and there is a natural pathos pervading 
the whole, which perfectly corresponded with my 
melancholy thoughts. Should you have anything 
else dozing upon your table, and unoccupied by 
brighter eyes, transfer it to me with your never- 
faiUng charity forthwith. 

During the principal part of this morning, I 
have been reduced to the forbidding study of 
the human face, not divine but demoniac, which 
infests the cour beneath my window. Groups of 
these wretches, condemned of Heaven and of earth, 
attracted by the sun, have been sauntering in their 
chains within ten paces of me; and, for want 
of more palatable resource, I sat contemplating 
their hideous physiognomies, till I was recalled 
from my visions of the fabled Rinaldo Rinaldini 
and his bandits, by one of them exclaiming, '' Qu'est- 



218 THE LIFE OF 

ce qu'il regarde done, ce sc^^rat de milord?'* 
This I soon perceived was addressed to my in- 
nocent self; and I retired from my reflections, and 
'* ma loge grill^e," amply convinced that all I had 
read or heard of the atrocities of this trempe of 
malefactors was realized to my view. 

I have nothing auspicious, in respect to my un- 
fortunate interests, to impart. A month to-morrow, 
I have been here, in tribulation, in suspense, and, at 
length, nearly in broken-heartedness ; no news has, 
as yet, arrived to me from England — ^friends indeed 
may not be found, though they must be already 
acquainted with my position. I speak only of 
those who, during my more prosperous days, were 
zealously served and assisted by me — to those it 
was as much, I considered, a duty as a necessity 
to appeal, at such an annihilating crisis. I had a 
right to promise myself instant emancipation, from 
their mutual aid ; from the delay, this confidence 
seems to have been deceived, and I cannot bear 
up against, nor long survive, the prolonged dis^ 
appointment. 

My first presentiment upon this infamous farce, 
this insulting calamity, coming abruptly upon me, 
was, that I should never leave these abhorred walls 
alive ; the despondent prestige now gains influence 
upon me, and I shudder even to think of it. God

Brummell's usual avocation in the morning, when 
not engaged at his toilette, was writing the notes 
I have laid before the reader. Sometimes he 
would throw oflF a few Latin verses, which he com- 
posed with great faciUty; he generally showed 
these elegant trifles to the political prisoner, his 
companion ; who informed me that they always 
contained " une sentence, une pens^e, une re- 
flexion philosophique, ^l^gamment et fortement 
exprimee/* Sometimes he would take up the first 
book, or brochure, that lay near him, and skim 
its pages. 

One day it happened to be a French trans- 
lation of Byron's Life, and, on perceiving this, 
he turned the pages over with rapidity — reading 
aloud, and with an air of great satisfaction and 
apparent pride, a passage in which he was fa- 
vourably mentioned : '' Oui," said he to Monsieur 
Godefroi, "ce po^te, ce grand homme, fut mon 
ami." This was the only occasion on which his 
companion ever heard him allude to the position 



220 THE LIFE OF 

he once occupied ; but, when his own country was 
the subject of conversation, he always expressed 
for it a high and honourable predilection — ^for 
though he had now been twenty years on the 
Continent, he had not lost any of the national 
spirit which almost every Englishman, under the 
happiest or most adverse circumstances, jealously 
preserves. 

When he had nothing to indite, and was tired of 
his book, he would approach the bars of the win- 
now nearest to the Cour de la Paille^ and con- 
template, as he observes in the preceding letter, 
the hideous physiognomies of the felons who were 
there confined. It was a disgusting sight, for the 
majority were often to be seen rolling about on 
the ground like so many animals, or lying lazily 
in the sun, occupied in pursuing the vermin which 
covered them. Brummell had not only many op- 
portunities of studying the countenances and occu- 
pations of these bandit lazzaroni, but he sometimes 
came in contact with them, in his way to the debt- 
ors' yard ; to gain which, he was obliged to cross 
the passage communicating with the principal en- 
trance to the prison. 

One morning, when en route to see a visitor, for 
he always received his friends in this yard, he was 
jostled with great violence by a prisoner of the 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 221 

name of Mazoyer, who, at the moment was return- 
ing from the court-house, where he had been tried 
for an attempt to murder one of the turnkeys of 
Beaulieu,* for which oflFence he had most unex- 
pectedly got oflF with a condemnation to the galleys 
ct perpetuite. Mazoyer was short and high-shoul- 
dered, and of Herculean strength, his enormous 
head being ornamented with small dark piercing 
eyes, sunk deep in a low forehead; a large flat nose, 
and a capacious mouth, which, when open, displayed 
a set of grinders like a crocodile's, gave additional 
fierceness to his countenance. 

When this monster pushed against Brummell, he 
started back in amazement at such a complication 
of ugliness and ferocity. Mazoyer perceiving this, 
stopped, and eyeing the Beau from head to foot, 
said, in a strong southern accent, and with a hideous 
smile, "N'ayez pas peur, monziou; je suis bien 
content, car je viens de gagner ma t^te." " Quel 
est cet animal, cette esp^ce d'ours, dont Tdpaule est 
venue me froisser le bras?" demanded Brummell 
when he had passed ; " quand il a ouvert la gueule

I HAVK said that Brummell spoke of Lord Byron to 
Monsieur Godefroi: it was perhaps on the same 
day that he wrote the following note. 

In Prison, Tuesday. 

Remerchnens reiteres for Washington Irving very 
delii^htful in both stories. I can answer for the 
truth of his account of poor Byron's never-dying 
ttttaehment to Mary Chaworth; for I have fre- 
quently heard him romanticise for hours about her. 
I remember being with her at her house, Colwick, 
near Nottingham, during a week, a few months 
substHjuent to her marriage. She appeared to me 
to W always vigiJpnt for admiration, coarse in her 
n\nnnei*s, and far from resembling what I should 
have wnaMved the heau ideal of Byron.* I could

It is the first time I ever heard mention of the 
sequel de la petite dame blanche. These descriptions 
recall to me a treasure in my possession — several 
letters upon most interesting subjects to Aim, written 
to me in our familiar days. Moore, when he was 
arranging his biography, which turned out to be 
unworthy of his memory, requested me to assist 
him with the letters in question, and I refused to 
entrust them to him. No eyes but my own, and 
those of one other person, who is now no more, 
have ever seen them. 

If you have anything arrived or remaining, that 
will distract or set me to sleep, waft it to me 
with my evening's nutrition ; it is that of the fabu- 
lous little good mouse, " three pears and a bit of

The correspondence that Brummell maintained 
with his more intimate friends during his impri- 
sonment, was one source of amusement to him, 
and gives a better idea of his feehngs under such 
a visitation, than any description of mine could do. 
Considering the paucity of incident in a prisoner's 
life, he showed more than ordinary ingenuity in 
keeping it up with so much spirit; and, though 
his letters are sometimes mournful enough, they are 
much more lively than might have been expected. 

** Three pears and a bit of brown bread," was a 
very indifferent supper for a man whose appetite

punch, and jellies of his friends, he appears at times 
to have stood a good chance of being reduced. 
Having complained again and again that his dinner 
from the hotel became daily more meagre, an ar- 
rangement was made with a restaurateur near the 
prison, to supply him with his meals. But the 
following remonstrance looks as if he had got out 
of the frying-pan into the fire ; and was as badly 
oflF for linen as for food. 

In Prison, June. 

My dear Armstrong, 

You would not, I am sensible, like to be imposed 
upon yourself, nor that I should be famished with 
hunger in a prison. 

I am ignorant both of the name and of the 
residence of the traiteur, or rather traitor, whom 
you have employed to purvey my daily meal ; he 
has indeed but one merit, and that is his punc- 
tuality at five o'clock. You shall judge your- 
self of his liberality, and I will neither exaggerate 
nor extenuate in my report. Yesterday's portion 
was the following :—half of the skeleton of a pigeon, 
which I firmly believe was the moitie of a crow, 
buried in rancid butter, and the solitary wing of an 
miieApoulet, without even the consolatory addenda 
of its Clime— half-a-dozen potatoes, and, by way of 

q2 



228 THE LIFE OF 

excuse for dessert, half-a-score of unripe cherries, 
accompanied with one pitiful biscuit, that looked like 
a bad halfpenny — this is the positive total of my 
dinner's calendar. 

Twice I have beseeched you to send me three 
towels, and to repeat that number every six days. 
I have been reduced, for the last eight-and-forty 
hours, to rub myself down with my dirty shirts, 
and that resource is now at an end, for they are 
gone to the washerwoman. 

Will you have the kindness to speak in a pe- 
remptory manner to those about you, if it is 
owing to their negligence I am to suffer these pri- 
vations ? I only ask for wholesome sustenance for 
my body, and salutary cleanliness for its outside. 
It is impossible to find these necessaries within this 
hell upon earth ; and with all my dejection,- I 
should be loath to give up the ghost from famine 
or filthiness. Amend these indispensable wants 
before you leave the town this evening. I am also 
in want of some old waistcoats and pantaloons, 
which were in the drawers of the bureau in my 
bed-room, at the Hotel d'Angleterre. There was 
also a pair of patched boots in the closet of the 
sitting-room ; and in the armoire a small glass 
bottle of Macouba snufi* — will you have the good- 
ness to transmit them to me ? 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 229 

Pray tell my friends that I am very fond of straw- 
berries, when they are in full season, and that they 
always do me good. In the schedule of my debts 
in Caen, which I wrote to you, I omitted to make 
the observation, that I was utterly in rags, and 
without the means of procuring better raiment. — 
Good-bye ; I would give half the remainder of my 
days to go down to the sea-side with you this 

evening. 

Most truly yours, 

A Monsieur Armstrong, G. B. 

Rue St. Jean. 

Brummell had now been six weeks in prison, 
without a hope of release, and the time wore very 
heavily away; the greater part of each morning 
was consumed in making his toilette, in which he 
was roughly assisted by the tambour j Paul Lepine: 
the drummer, however, under his master's supervi- 
sion, soon acquired great proficiency in the art of 
cleaning boots and brushing clothes ; and at two 
o'clock Brummell descended into the debtors' court 
with his neckcloth as white and well tied, his hat 
smoothed to a hair, and his whole exterior as per- 
fect, as if he had been going to pay Mrs. B a 

morning visit. This court -yard was separated from 
that of the thieves and the other criminals, by a 



230 THE LIFE OF 

partition, but it was so slight, that what they said 
could be distinctly heard through it; the crimes 
and adventures of these gentlemen formed a pro- 
lific topic of conversation for BrummelFs visitors, 
and occasionally furnished a subject upon which 
he expatiated in his weekly billets to his friends. 
It was here, between the hours of two and four 
in the afternoon, that he received his numerous 
visitors, and as they were, both French and English, 
generally confirmed idlers, his levees used to be 
very well attended. This portion of the day passed 
merrily^enough, and the loud laughter that might 
often be heard, would have led any one to suppose 
that the inmates of this part of the prison were 
not very deeply affected by their unfortunate posi- 
tion. If, however, any one offered to condole 
with Brummell upon the tardiness of the prepa- 
rations for his release, his gaiety soon evaporated, 
and a flood of tears was sure to follow any well- 
intentioned observation of the kind. 

In the centre of this apology for a place of exer- 
cise, there was a very diminutive plot of garden, in- 
tended to be ornamental, but the miserable flowers 
that grew in it were of the most ordinary description. 
When the Beau's visitors were gone to their differ- 
ent homes, and he was left to his solitary walk here 
in the long summer evenings, the rank-smelling 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 231 

marigold must have appeared unfeelingly gay and 
gaudy, and the heart's-ease sadly misplaced. The 
debtors who paced the narrow pathway that sur- 
rounded them, and who were nearly as ragged 
and drooping as the flowers themselves, were all 
of the middling and lower class, and nothing 
could exceed their civility to Brummell during 
his stay amongst them : this arose probably from 
a feeling that his change of fortune, from afflu- 
ence to destitution, was greater than theirs ; they 
had no doubt heard that he was at one time the 
companion of his sovereign, and knew nothing of 
the intermediate stages of distress that he had 
passed through since that period. Brummell was 
too well bred to reject their advances, and though, 
under other circumstances, he certainly would not 
have chosen them for associates, their attentions 
were received with pleasure ; a bow to one, or some 
amusing remark to another, was always ready, and 
long before he left his '' stone-jug," he succeeded in 
making himself extremely popular with them. With 
one of the debtors, a Monsieur Bassy, he was on 
more intimate terms : this individual, who had on- 
ginally been a butler in some family of distinction, 
previously to the great Revolution, was remarkable 
for his agreeable manners and entertaimng con- 
versation, qualifications that induced Brummell to 



232 THE LIFE OF 

select him for a companion. The next two let- 
ters are written in a mournful strain. 

In Prison, Friday. 

Dear , 

I am sinking fast into the delusions of presen- 
timent, and the credulous faith of dreams; but, dur- 
ing my last night's slumber, I fancied you had 
received a note for me from England, and yet sent 
it not. When my Cerberus unbarred my cell at 
seven this morning, I scrutinized anxiously his 
iron hand, expecting the cheering sight of a scrap 
of paper, and even I asked him impatiently if no 
letter had been left at the wicket for me. He 
shook his gory locks at me in the forbidding sense 
of negative, clanked his bouquet of keys in my 
awakened face, and left me in disappointment. 

Was my nightly vision merely the effect of a 
distempered brain in darkness, or have you really 
received a word^ which bids me look forward to 
liberty and relief? I am dreadfully abattu with all 
my thoughts of the past as well as of the future. 
I have this instant received a visit from Monsieur 
Target.* He said he did not know I was here, 
and hoped I was a mon aise ! ! ! Oh the Saracen ! 
What reptiles are those who administer to the jus-

tice and dynasty of this country! They cannot 
be so m our country, though I begin even to sus- 
pect them. 

The bearer of this is one of my confidential 
keepers. I will not boast of my new acquaintance ; 
but I believe there is not one of them whose heart 
I have not gained, and who would not open my 
prison door to me on my parole.

Monday morning. 

The night is as weary as the day. I dream con- 
tinually. If there should exist any reciprocity of 
prescience between us, do pray endeavour to dream 
that you have once more seen me ci flaner in the 
Rue St. Jean, or upon the Cours, with my hat on 
one side, and in gaiety and persiflage of heart a rive 
at the absurdities of our compatriotes, who I hear are 
fast replenishing the town, when all its better in- 
digenous inhabitants are regaling themselves with 
roses and strawberries h leurs chateaux. It may 
identify reality.

shadows of somnolency. Tell her too, that I will 
write to her, as my spirits and faculties may be 
ameliorated by the never-failing intensity of my 
prayers to Him to whose mercy and clemency she 
recommends their address. My anxiety to see those 
friends who have been so kind to me surpasses every 
other wish, should the blessing of Uberty be regained 
by me. I feel, though I began my note to you in 
comparative calmness, that I shall lose it if I dwell 
upon its concluding subject. 

Ever sincerely yours,

CHAPTER XIX. 

Brommell in improved spirits — Letters to his friends — His criticism on 
their sea-side amusements — Explanation of them — Subscriptions made by 
the English at Caen — Lord Granville assists — Mr. Armstrong despatched 
to England — A rainy morning inspires the Beau with poetical feelings — 
Lines to Eugenie — Letter accompanying them — A sketch of this young 
lady. 

The improved spirits in which he wrote the succeed- 
ing letter most likely arose partly, from the hope 
that Mr. Armstrong, in his approaching journey to 
London, which had now been determined upon, to 
consult with and prevail upon his friends to Eissist 
him again, might effect his release ; and partly to 
an encouraging note he had received from the friend 
to whom it was addressed. 

In Prison, July, . 



Your last note has had the mystic charm of the 
words of the talisman of Oromanes : it has revived 
hope, given me sufficient rest for two successive 
nights, and I have this morning looked up to the 
sun as I would congratulate the smiling face of an 
old friend. 

Armstrong says he shall depart for London on 



236 THE LIFE OF 

Tuesday next : on the result of his mission will 
depend my destiny, the delight of seeing you and all 
my friends again, or the death warrant of my inter- 
ment here. 

I am ashamed of myself for having so long in- 
carcerated Simeon. He has amused me, though 
he does not communicate any description or obser- 
vation very new; but when I can meet with any 
thing that cheats the monotony of desolate hours, 
I am selfishly unwilling to release it. I was much 
pleased with Abbotsford and Newstead Abbey ; 
but it makes one sorry to find that so delightful 
an author can only afford one scanty volume at a 
time. 

Have you Fanny Kemble's journey in America ? 
Should it be out of sight and still in hand, pray 
confer the favour of its loan to me ; if not, any 
other recent production that may be dormant upon 
your table. That familiar representative of the 
dead as well as the living, Caspar Hauser, told me 
the other day that Mademoiselle * * * * lives an am- 
phibious life during this fine weather, half aquatic, 
half pastoral ; flirts with Highland butterflies in a 
gondola, and then dines upon a haycock ; imbibes 
porter, and familiarizes with earwigs and wasps. 
May I request you to whisper to her that I am dis- 
tracting myself with a few innocent stanzas in honour 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 237 

of her and her truant sisters ? They may be infected 

with the local gloom of every thing that surrounds 

me, yet they shall not be unworthy of their amiable 

subject. 

Spare me now and then a desultory moment and 

write. I will allow you every marine latitude in 

your social entretiens with the innocent Nereids, but 

I know not a Triton upon your shore worthy of 

your community. Would to heaven I was Uberated 

from my unjust bondage within these inexorable 

walls! 

Very sincerely yours, 

A Madame , G. B. 

Luc-sur-Mer. 

The ambiguity of Brummell's style has already 
been adverted to, and a portion of this letter is a 
forcible example of it. In alluding to the young 
lady who is thus rudely tossed upon a haycock, 
and accused of drinking porter with earwigs and 
wasps, one could scarcely suppose that he is 
speaking of a pic-nic, and a boating party, in 
which a Scotch gentleman was one of the ca- 
valiers. 

To turn, however, from the amusements of his 
friends to the consideration of his affairs : shortly 
ofter he was arrested, his countrymen immediately

stepped forward to assist him, but though these 
subscriptions amounted to a considerable sum, and 
to them was added that of Lord Granville, our 
ambassador at Paris, for five hundred francs — the 
largest donation made by any individual in France — 
the relief thus afforded him, valuable as it was 
in procuring the means of softening the rigours 
of his confinement, was wholly inadequate to liqui- 
date Mr. Leveux's claim ; the subscription which 
had been raised by the French gentlemen of his 
acquaintance was declined, with many expressions 
of gratitude for their spirited and liberal conduct. 
The feeling which dictated this honourable refusal, 
was a creditable pride on the part of his country- 
men, who thought that Brummell in returning to 
French society would be more independent if free 
from obligations of this nature. The only chance, 
therefore, that he had of obtaining his liberty, 
was through his friends in England, and to them 
Mr. Armstrong was at length despatched ; during 
the tantaUzing period of his absence, Brummell 
continued his gossiping correspondence with one 
or two of his friends in the town. 

In Prison, July. 

Since Sunday last, I have been really so much 
occupied with the departure of the Sieur Arm- 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 239 

strong for England, that I have really been unequal 
to attend to my first of duties^ that of writing 
to you. 

- You are always commemorated as the coryphee 
par excellence of those " ministering angels," who 
best attend to my exigencies ; my thanks to you 
are almost as much worn out as my patience, not 
to mention ma capote. I am indebted to your 
honte for Fanny Kemble : our acquaintance has 
just commenced. I like her upon our earlier flirta- 
tion, and therefore, our intimacy will be soon at 
an end. 

With all my usual abstractions, or rather dis- 
tractions, I find, I must inadvertently have dropped 
something yesterday about having indited a few 
effusions in the metrical Une, in which the con- 
secrated name of Eugenie was recorded ; believe 
me, it was not profaned, it was written on a rainy 
day when I was, from depression of spirits, more 
fit for what is called the camisole in Bedlam, than 
even a cradle at the foot of Parnassus. I am 
now ashamed of them ; we all have our little vani- 
ties, and upon looking them over this morning, 
I find so many faults and disabilities in the abrupt 
attempt to do justice to their difficult theme, that 
they must be corrected, curtailed, and amended, 
before they are prostrated before your mutual eyes. 



240 THB LIFB OF 

You tell me she has been screaming to see them : 

pray assure her from me, that she must not 

interrupt your evening siesta with these impatient 

ejaculations ; that they are perhaps unworthy of her 

attention; but, as she desires a survey, I can 

refuse her nothing — they shall be transmitted the 

instant they are rationally revised. Good night,

The lines were accordingly " corrected, curtailed, 
and amended," and sent a few evenings after with 
the following note. 

In Prison, July. 

My favourite pet brute, Cerberus, is going to 
take a stroll by moonlight, and I cannot neglect 
the opportunity of tying a note to his iron collar, 
a voire adresse — it is in pursuance of my promise, 
I send you enclosed, what I had the indiscretion 
to tell you I had written on a desolate rainy 
morning, it is nonsense to endeavour ameliorating 
such namby pamby, and I submit it to your mercy 
and that of Mademoiselle Eugenie, in the barbar- 
ous state in which it dropped primitively from my 
disordered brains. I have only omitted a few

stanzas, which, as I could not understand myself 
when I afterwards looked them over, it would be 
too unjust, and hard upon you both to record. 
Grood night: the dog is waiting with impatience, 
playing with his keys as if they belonged to your 
watch, and they make my head ache. 

Ever yours, 

A Mademoiselle , G. B, 

Luc-sur-Mer, 

I must beg the reader's kind excuses, if I 
inflict another letter upon him, before putting him 
in possession of these " curtailed, corrected, and 
amended stanzas." Night brought with it reflec- 
tion, and the imprisoned poet determined that fur- 
ther revision was necessary. They were afterwards 
inclosed, and sent with the next letter. 

In Prison, July. 

Not a word yet from England ; but I hear, not 
however officially, that things are at length going 
on favourably. This reminds me of your consola- 
tory prediction, two months ago ; and I shall never 
be able to express my gratitude to you for its most 
amiable and friendly augury. 

The shadow of my poetic spirit haunts me 
still, and will not suffer me to rest, till I have

exorcised it ¥rith further castigation ; the doggrel 
I sent you the other evening was transcribed 
at dusk, and that dim period is darkness here, 
which induces me to fear that my autography 
may have been as flagrantly en d^^rissement as my 
minstrelsy ; — ^let my retiring vanities be peacefully 
appeased in their adieux, by the ultimate effort at 
correction^ now that meridian beams are shining in 
upon me, and my senses are better regies — particu- 
larly that of sight. In her second shroud, I submit 
to your forgiving inspection, the remains of a de- 
ceased muse, that I have already intimated to you 
were interred on a rainy morning; they are the 
only particles I could preserve from their con- 
firmed decay ; the rest were in a deplorable state of 
decomposition, and utterly unworthy of being em- 
balmed by your lecture ; — have the charitable grace 
to bestow an Ave Maria over them. 

I am almost enjoying this partial simshine that 
is glancing in at my grille, though it may revive 
other thoughts of other days ; would to heaven I 
was once more delivered from the noxious vapours 
of this earthly Phlegethon ! The most adverse destiny 
*h«Jl never entrap me again ! On Wednesday I will

he is a remarkably gqod-looking animal, mild, too, 
in his manners, and has freqoentiy moved my hu- 
manity, even to assisting him in my humble way. 

I shall remember, to my last hour, his cries and 
struggles to avoid the additional irons that were 
forced upon his arms and throat, even to the arrival 
of six des mUiiaireSy when he was quieted to insensi- 
bility, and conducted to his eternal subterranean 
cell. And yet I exist in dose adjacency to these 
outcasts ! 

Cerberus k parte-def told me, when he left my 
last letter at your gate of Paradise, that you were 
still gathering sea-breezes, shells, and dust, on the 
shores of Luc. Your fiiend D* * * * annihilates me 
with petits sains; he sent me word the other day, 
that he regretted his visit to the country, because 
his absence would deprive him of seeing me. 

I hear Mademoiselle Eugenie is advancing in the 
knowledge of pure Celtic, which they say is always 
best taught and learned by the eyes ! Pray remem- 
ber me devotedly to her. 

Yours, very sincerely, 

A Madame , G. B. 

Luc-sur-Mer. 

It will be proper to observe, by way of explana- 
tory remark, that Eugenie, to whom these lines 

r2 



244 THE LIFE OF 

were addressed, and who was so rapidly advancing 
in the knowledge of " pure Celtic," the poweir of 
teaching which the Beau so drolly and wickedly 
ascribes to the eyes, was only fifteen, and with her 
" truant sisters ** then on a visit in England, formed 
a constellation which he always specially admired. 
They were of gentle blood, in Brummell's eyes 
almost an indispensable qualification. Eugenie, the 
youngest of the three, and who replaced his ab- 
sent favourite, was as simple and unaffected as the 
snowdrop ; and though as yet merely an opening 
flower, the outline of her fairy form gave promise 
of future elegance and beauty ; and no doubt re- 
vived the memory of some of the graceful beings 
who formed the brilliant " coryphees ^ to which he 
alludes in several of his letters. 

TO EUGENIE. 
Lines written in Prison on a Rainy Morning. 

O'ercast in gloom arose the day, 

No genial ray 
From heaven, to cheer the fetter'd or the free ; 

Mute was the slumbering scene around. 

And hush'd each sound, 
Save the soft plaintive orison of Eug6nie. 

On fancied roses she had slept, 
But waking wept 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 245 

To find so soon the charm'd iUusion flee ; 

That dreamt of absent sisters dear, 

Approaching near 
To hail the morning's dawn with smiles to Eugenie. 

'Twas breathed in accents low, 

As southern zephyrs blow 
O'er banks of violets, or the faint aerial lullaby 

Of music's distant notes. 

That in the silent evening floats 
In cadence dying on the ear, the plaint of Eugenie. 

" Alas !" she murm'ring said, 
" The world to me seems almost dead ; 
No social echo of our home's forsaken gaiety, 
No thoughts reciprocal expressed. 
Affection's fairest test, 
To vibrate on the heart, or sympathize with Eugenie. 

" Fast falling showers, 

In shadows dim the ling'ring hours ; 

As if they sought to mourn with kindred memory and me, 
Weep o'er the dreary space. 
And the bright promise of the vision chase, 

That flatter'd with delight the fairy dream of Eug^ie. 

" Still one revered remains. 

Who when the tremulous voice complains. 
Pleading the grief of those away with fond humility, 

Will not the suppliant advocate disdain, 

Nor long refrain 
To mingle mutual feeling with the hopes of Eugenie. 

** Ah ! mother justly dear, 

Dispel each latent adverse fear 



246 THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 

That clouds the happy compact of our filial trinity ; 

Towards thee in undivided love, 

Our supplicated union prove, 
Let them return ; it is the prostrate prayer of Eagenie.'^ 

This brief soliloquy address'd. 

Was from a neighbouring nest 
O'erheard, a redbreast listened on its shelt'ring tree ; 

With friendship's votive wings 

To me the tender tale he brings ; 
Some natural tears he shed, and sfgh'd the name of £ug6nie. 

Trembling the poor bird fled again. 

He heard a chain ! 
Raised his light pinions in the pride of cherish'd liberty, 

And left me lone and sorrow'd 

With the pensive strain he borrowed, 
And doubly fetter'd with the downcast cares of Eugenie. 

Eugenie is now a star in the East ; and such was 
the effect of her beauty in maturity, that it is said 
the very surf at Madras was lulled in admiration 
and astonishment when she first made her appear- 
ance on that angry shore : as for the catamarans, 
they crossed their arms as well as their legs, and 
sat staring in amazement as she landed (was ever 
such a thing heard of before ?) in the ship's gig. 



CHAPTER XX. 

The outr^ brigand — His attempt to chaoge his quarters— Fanny Kemble's 
Joumej in America — ^The Beau's letters to his friends — Monsieur le Baron 
de Bresmenil — His dinner to Brummell in prison— The abstraction of the 
brandy bottle — Brummell's pathetic appeal to the turnkey Brillant — ^The 
felons' departure — Mr. Armstrong's mission successful — ^Tlie triple murder. 

The ** outr^ brigand'' mentioned by Brummell in 
the letter which accompanied these verses, was a 
rogue of the name of Auvray, condemned to the 
galleys for twenty years for stealing, when confined 
at the Beaulieu for a previous offence, some trifling 
article from one of his fellow-prisoners. On the 
morning referred to by Brummell, this light-fingered 
and light-heeled young gentleman, instigated by the 
tender passion, or a love of fun, scaled the wall 
which separated him from the women's court-yard, 
a feat worthy of being recorded, for the wall was 
twelve feet in height, and the fetters attached to his 
left leg weighed fifteen French pounds. Once on 
the top, which he gained by a jump and a scramble, 
he dropped himself down on the other side, and 
ran up to the women's apartment, from which (the 
inmates being at their toilet) screams of surprise 



248 THE LIFE OF 

were heard. The next moment he was m the hands 
of the turnkeys, havmg scarcely had sufficient time 
to throw a glance at the honris whom he had so 
unceremoniously honoured with a visit. Auvray 
made no resistance until his captors endeavoured 
to adorn his right leg with another bracelet of fifteen 
pounds^ to prevent such itineraiit practices in future ; 
he then made a most desperate resistance, and sub- 
mitted only when his blood flowed freely from a 
blow given him by one of the jailors with his bunch 
of keys. Brummell, who witnessed this scene, was 
very angry at such a piece of brutal cowardice, and 
said to his companion Godefroi, *' Get homme est 
brave, dans un si^ge il eut ^t^un heros! je le plains." 
In the next letter, which is the last but bne of those 
written from prison, his gossip opens with a pun- 
gent critique upon the work of a lady whose maiden 
name, and the associations connected with it, should 
have protected her from such censure ; but the con- 
cluding paragraph of the succeeding one implies 
that he had relented a little from his severity. 

In Prison, July. 

Mes remerdmens to you, I have often repeated, 
are infinite, but almost exhausted. I restore Mrs. 
Butler to your protection : that name is more cow- 
venable to her language than Fanny Kemble. I

began to be fatigued with her posiiche sensibility, 
and, as she wishes one to believe, her natural 
refinement : perhaps more recommendable qualities 
will be elucidated under your discerning supervi- 
sion. Have you any thing else arrived to relieve 
the absolute vacancy of my studies ? 

You will say that 1 am pufied up with my own 
solitary consequence, which is usually generated 
"by living almost constantly tete-a-tete with oneself; 
and that I vainly imagine people are voluntarily to 
impart their thoughts and even their whereabouts 
to me, because I am in local durance. It is not, 
however, so with me ; there are but few of whom 
I think myself, fewer, I am sensible, who ever think 
of me : youj and yours, are exceptions, that it is 
not only a consolation, but a pride to me^ to 
remember almost every hour ; for you have inva- 
riably extended to me every kindness : forgive this 
egotism, it is as barefaced as Fanny Kemble and 
her me's ; but I cannot reconcile to my sequestered 
vanity why * * * * disguised her intention of preci- 
pitately leaving Caen. If it was only the abrupt 
vagary of the moment, excited by meridian beams 
to court the cooler atmosphere of the sea-shore, 
(where, by the bye, there is no friendly umbrage 
saving that of the parasol,) I will forgive her the 
desertion, and implore her absolution of my tran-

sient worldly vanities; but it is impossible for 
amiable beings^ like her, to be lost in sight even 
for a day. 

I have been lately infested with a good-natured 
friend, who has favoured me with the cancanneries 
of the graceless reptiles that adorn this town ; those 
who are amusing themselves in chains at saute de 
grenouille under my window, are saints in com- 
parison. 

J£ Mademoiselle Eugenie has any narcotic, or 
other composing nostrum, that will speedily propi- 
tiate oblivion, pray tell her to let me have some^ I 
can find none here — in exchange, I will send her 
back all my recollections ; if she has any vanity in 
her composition, she would jump at the preferred 
compact^ they are replete with admiration and 
praise of her, and as they are reflected from her 
living self, they form a most enchanting biography 
of two months, in the shape of a romance : if she 
refuses them, they will be consigned to the Styx, 
which I shall soon pass over. 

If you have a vacant instant from the Nereids, 
(I beseech you to avoid the Tritons,) do let me 
learn de vos nouvelles. 

Ever sincerely yours, 

A Madame , Q^ B^ 

Luc-sur-Mer. 



GBOROB BRUMMBLL. 25] 

Much of the cheerfulness and occasional gaiety 
that Brummell displayed during the period of his 
imprisonment was forced; his companion told me 
that he frequently found him in tears : once only 
did he throw off the load of anguish, which, indif- 
ferently concealed, he must always have felt in a 
greater or less degree. " On that day," said Mon- 
sieur Godefroi, " he seemed to recover the elas- 
ticity of spirits he must have possessed in his 
youth, and the originality of his character came 
forth in such bright relief that I could easily com- 
prehend why he had been so celebrated, and his 
society so much sought after by the great and 
talented of his countrymen." The reason that led 
to this unbending, this change from his usual 
apathy of demeanom*, to an almost juvenile exhi- 
bition pf his entertaining powers, was a good din- 
ner — at all times a great softener of his heart ; 
but, when starving upon " the skeletons of pigeons, 
mutton chops not larger than half-a-crown, and bis- 
cuits like a bad halfpenny," it must have been 
particularly acceptable; it was not marvellous, 
therefore, that his blood should circulate more 
rapidly at such a prospect, especially as the ban- 
quet was gratuitous. The gentleman who gave 
him this fete was Monsieur le Baron de Bres- 
menil, a nobleman of large fortune, living in the 



252 THE LIFE OF 

environs, who, in a fit of the spleen, or of fan, 
had been guilty of high treason on the high-road 
— that is, he had saluted from his cabriolet de voyage 
some zealous supporter of Louis-Philippe with 
cries of Vive Henri Cinq; which, being in defiance 
of the one-thousand-nine-hundred-and-ninety-ninth 
article of "la Charte," chapter two-hundred-and- 
sixty-three, page six-hundred-and-seventy-four, he 
was sentenced to lose his liberty for five days — 
and, fortunately for Brummell, they were passed 
in the prison of Caen. Gaily were these five days 
of political martyrdom spent, and, before leaving 
his less fortunate companions, the Baron, with a 
very laudable spirit of hospitality, obtained the 
Governor's permission to give this dinner, and to 
invite a few friends with whom Brummell was 
also acquainted. 

It was a princely repast : Monsieur Longuet, who 
has been already mentioned, received carte blanche, 
and, from an amiable feeling of courtesy on the part 
of Monsieur de Bresmenil, Brummell was desired 
to choose his favourite plats, and that gentleman 
ordered such others as were most likely to please 
him. When therefore the dinner was served, and 
the covers had been removed, a look of extreme 
satisfaction lighted up the Beau's features, and, 
as the bee wings his flight from flower to flower, 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 253 

sipping sweets from each, so did Brammell wan- 
der from entree to hora dosuvre^ from mushroom 
to truffle, and from the homard to the fruits glacis ; 
Chambertin and Laffitte replaced his daily brandy- 
and-water of the previous weeks, and the iced 
draughts of the sparkling Ai, rolling gently down 
his throat, put the crowning stroke to his happi- 
ness. He rose above his misfortunes, and great 
was his good humour, he related much — he re- 
lated well ; anecdote after anecdote of his early life 
followed in quick succession, and, while wrapt in 
all the imperturbable a^rieux of a good narrator, 
he threw his companions into fits of laughter. 
But, as in a palace, so in a prison, there is 
no happiness without alloy. The dinner over, 
coffee was brought in, and. Monsieur le Comte 
de Roncherolles, a very kind friend of Brummell's, 
announced for the chasse a bottle of his old eau- 
de-vie dAndayey which his celebrated acquaintance 
had many times, and imder more agreeable cir- 
cumstances^ acknowledged to be perfect. Brum- 
mell was in raptures — " Fetch the bottle," he cried 
to one of the three young thieves who waited, 
"fetch the bottle: my dear de Roncherolles, no 
cognac that I ever tasted can be compared to yours 
of Andaye." 

One of the petty larcenists immediately left the 
room for the brandy, but did not return ; another 



f 



254 THE LIFE OF 

was sent to hasten him, and the third, but neither 
they nor the brandy made its appearance: the 
revellers, at length, became impatient at the delay, 
and shouted for their attendants, who arrived with 
the pleasing intelligence, that the brandy of Mon- 
sieur le Comte had disappeared! This declara- 
tion was received with a burst of indignation; 
and the Baron, tall, and made like a Farnese 
Hercules, threatened to throw the three footmen 
out of the window — forgetting, in the height of hi^ 
anger, that it was well-furnished with bars to pre- 
vent his own exit. At this juncture, and in the 
midst of the fray, Brummell, disappointed and trem- 
bling with passion, rose hastily from his chair, and, 
spreading out his arms towards the supposed de- 
linquents, with the gesture of a person who com- 
mands and yet entreats, shrieked out, " Malheu- 
reux! avez-vous k vous plaindre? on ne vous a 
que trop bien traits. Sc^drats, rendez-moi mon 
pousse caf^.'* This energetic and pathetic address 
actually drew tears from his own eyes, and a 
chorus of execrations from the guests ; the more 
so as one of the party, who returned at the mo- 
ment from making a search, informed them of 
what the attendants feared to relate — ^that the 
turnkey, honest Brillant, to whose especial care 
the cognac had been confided, had drained it to 
the last drop, and was lying insensible and snoring 



GEORGE BRUMMBLL. 255 

in a corner. The empty bottle was lying by his 
side ; the sheep had been confided to the care of 
the wolf ! Thus ended the Baron's dinner, which 
offered a striking example of the chances and 
changes of life — at the same table were assembled 
a famous courtier, once the companion of a King, 
a Count, a Baron, a newspaper editor, and an old 
butler, for Monsieur Bassy was of the party. Melan- 
choly to say, three of these individuals were sub- 
sequently afllicted by aberration of intellect, and 
two of them, Brummell and Bassy, died in the 
establishment of the Bon Sauveur. 

The last episode of Brummell's prison life was, 
witnessing the departure of those criminals who 
had been condemned to the galleys at the pre- 
vious assize. Amongst the more celebrated, was 
Ansieu, who, in an affray with the turnkeys, had 
part of his nose taken off by a sabre cut; Coursifere, 
one of the most clever of the Paris thieves ; 
Auvray, and the ours Mazoyer. At day-break, 
these forgatSy and their companions, were marched 
into the turnkey's room, where fetters, of fifteen 
pounds weight, were riveted to their legs ; to the 
loud knocks and ring of the hammers which ad- 
justed their irons, was added a chorus of their own 
composition in the thieves' language, the burden 
of each couplet being adieus to their comrades 



256 THE LIFE OF 

who remained. These were accompanied by male- 
dictions in honour of the judges, the tomkeys, 
and the rural guards, who were to accompany 
them to their destination. Coursi&re was the poet of 
the party on this occasion^ and to him were confided 
the solo parts, which he gave in a stentorian voice, 
to the well-known air of " C'est I'amour, I'amour, 
Tamour," &c., to which the chorus vociferated by 
the whole band was, " C'est au bagne, au bagne, 
au bagne, amis, nous y allons.'* 

The first burst of this discordant singing roused 
Brummell from his slumbers, and on descending to 
his breakfast, he said to his fellow-prisoner, ** Mais, 
Monsieur Godefroi, je me suis cm ce matin au foi^ 
de Vulcain : quelle musique infernale ! mes oreilles 
en sont encore ddchirdes !" When these felons 
left, Brummell presented a man of the name of 
Juel with two francs, I believe principally because 
his manners were much more distinguished than 
those of his companions. 

Towards the middle of July, the unfortunate 
prisoner's prospects began to assume a brighter 
aspect. His friends in England, though anxious to 
assist him, were averse to going round from door 
to door, a difficulty which was overcome on Mr. 
Armstrong's arrival ; for, being unembarrassed by 
any feelings of delicacy, he undertook the collection 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 257 

of the several donations entirely as a man of bu- 
siness; and carried it through with the more 
energy and activity, as he was himself again a cre- 
ditor, for upwards of two hundred pounds. 

But Brummell calculated upon the generosity of 
his former acquaintance with greater confidence 
than he was justified in doing ; for, having already 
assisted him, they were not Ukely to be impressed 
witfi very strong feelings of compassion : and even 
from those friends who had on former occasions 
so generously relieved him, no great exertions 
could fairly be expected ; for his embarrassments 
had been so often represented to them, and some- 
times with more colouring than the case required, 
that several of them looked on with apathy. 

The generous feelings, however, of the more 
himiane were roused. The Beau's sheet-anchors, 
whenever distress visited him, were the present 
Duke of Beaufort and Lord Alvanley ; and the 
influence of these noblemen, particularly the latter, 
induced several persons to subscribe to the fund for 
his release, who probably would not have done so 
without such interest had been made in his favour. 
The subscriptions of the noblemen and gentlemen 
who now came to his rescue, were accompanied 
by a generous donation of a hundred pounds from 
his late Majesty, who knew, I believe, very little of 

VOL. II. S 



258 THE LIFE OF 

Brummell ; but his deplorable condition was brought 
under his notice by General U n, through Sir Her- 
bert Taylor. This charitable action is one of many 
like it, which that kind-hearted king performed in 
private. A pony each was also given by the Duke of 
Devonshire, Lord Sefton, General Upton, General 
Grosvenor, Colonel G. Howard, Colonel D. Darner, 
Mr. Greville, Mr. Chester, and Mr. Standish. To 
these sums were added two hundred pounds of the 

public money, by Lord P n, in consideration of 

the loss Brummell had sustained by the abolition 
of the consulate. The liberality of these gentle- 
men enabled Mr. Armstrong to compromise, not 
only the debt to Mr. Leveux, but also those owing 
in the town of Caen; and the annual donations 
then promised by the Duke of Beaufort, Lords 
Sefton and Alvanley, and Mr. C. Greville, gave 
assurance of his having something to prevent a 
recurrence of similar difficulties. This well-timed 
assistance saved the Beau and his family from the 
mortification which was nearly brought upon them, 
by a most injudicious proposition, that a statement 
of his case should be sent to the clubs, more parti- 
cularly to Brookes's and White's, the scene of his 
triumphs and of his ruin. Fortunately a different 
course was adopted, and the world of fashion was 
saved the disgrace of seeing their former idol a

mendicant, where he had reigned more absolute 
than, happily for the national comfort, his friend, 
who lived in the ugly red building at the bottom 
of the street, in which these hotbeds of politics 
and the great legal hell are situated. During the 
short period that was required to give effect to the 
arrangements with his principal creditor, he re- 
gained much of his usual spirits ; and the following 
note is the last that he wrote from his cell. 

In Prison, July. 

You will soon be as well acquainted with our 
" Newgate Calendar " here as myself. I send you 
" TAmi de la Y6nt6/' because it contains the account 
of a triple murder of the most horrible description, 
committed by a wretch who has just been surren- 
dered by the gens d'armes to this last receptacle of 
his living days. He is rather a decent-looking 
reprobate, and I could not discriminate, by his 
countenance or manner, the least trace of compunc- 
tion or shame. He seems so quiet and insouciant 
of his enormous delinquency, that I shall seek an 
early occasion to make him confess the whole de- 
tail of the circumstances attending his crime ; for 
I understand he is very accessible upon the sub- 
ject, and is even proud of relating them. Grod of

heaven, what creatures bearing human faces and 
forms surround me ! This instance, however, is 
the most atrocious within my immediate cogniz- 
ance ; and I have already made up my mind to 
hear his dreadful tale, the first time I find him 
alone at the grille which separates our departments. 
The various histories of others, almost equally 
nefarious, they have unreservedly related to me 
vivd voce; for, when once their existence is con- 
demned, they appear perfectly unconcerned who 
may know the worst — a few sous always obtain 
their explicit confidence. I have made constant 
memorandums of many entretiens with them when 
I was released from their proximity. 

Adieu ; as Fanny Kemble says, " do not forget 
little me." The poor spoiled girl is a sad egotist; 
but if you could see her face, you would forgive 
her.

Rue . 

The triple murder to which Brummell refers was 
committed by Pierre Riviere, of the commune of 
Aunaye : he was the murderer of his mother, at the 
time enceinte, his younger brother, and a sister, a 



GBORGB BRUMMELL. 261 

mere child. The jury brought in a verdict of in- 
sanity, and he was subsequently confined in the 
Bon Sauveur, and died there before, or a short time 
after, Brummell was placed in that establishment. 
When Riviere was searched, a crucifix and a small 
sum of money were found in his pocket ; the latter 
he immediately placed in the hands of the head 
turnkey, fortunately not Monsieur Brillant, saying 
to him with much good sense, and but little ap- 
pearance of aberration of mind, '* Qu'il n'^tait pas 
prudent d'avoir sur lui dans la compagnie ou il allait 
se trouver ce peu d'argent, qui pouvait lui 6tre si 
necessaire dans sa position!" His features were 
regular, and his countenance altogether was one of 
much benignity and softness. 

The cur^ of Aunaye, who came to see him soon 
after his committal, was astounded at the crime, for 
he had always known him to be an industrious and 
well-conducted lad, kind in his disposition, and 
attentive to his religious duties. Previously to his 
trial, he employed himself in preparing a statement 
in explanation of his conduct in this horrible tra- 
gedy. As his labours advanced he showed them to 
the juge dUnstruction, before whom he often desired 
to be brought: he also studied mathematics, but 
with his fellow-prisoners he never conversed. Brum-

the felons recite their adventures, listening eagerly 
to their accounts of the most atrocious crimes, but 
his curiosity did not lead him further ; he was no

an attorney, came to the prison, and notified to 
Bnimmell that his debt to Mr. Leveux had been 
paid, and that he was at liberty to leave when he 
pleased. To the astonishment of every one, how- 
ever, he received the information without manifest- 
ing the sUghtest surprise or joy, or indeed any 
emotion whatever ; and, at five o'clock in the after- 
noon, after an imprisonment of two months and 
seventeen days, hope and fear alternately predomi- 
nating, and having experienced with apparent calm- 
ness many humiliations, he left his dungeon with the 
same forced insouciance, and returned to the H6tel 
d'Angleterre, where he once more settled himself 
in the same rooms he had occupied previously to 
his arrest. 

On the evening of this very day he presented 



264 THE LIFE OF 

himself at a large soiree at the General's. Nothing 
could exceed the astonishment of the company when 
he made his appearance, for they had not heard of 
his release ; but as he advanced towards the centre 
of the room, every one rose simultaneously and 
congratulated him on his good fortune. Brummell, 
with much complacency and an air of nonchalance, 
bowed his thanks, and said, " Messieurs, je suis bien 
oblig^ pour votre bont^, et charm^ de me trouver 
encore une fois parmi vous ; je puis vous assurer 
que c'est aujourd'hui le plus heureux jour de ma vie, 
car je suis sorti de prison," here he paused, and then 
gravely added, *' etfai mange du saumon.'^ But the 
gaiety that he displayed after his imprisonment was 
all assumed : it was put on to hide his real feelings, 
which must have been most painful and distressing. 

" I regret," said Madame de T , '' having 

lost several letters, and some poetry, that he sent 
to me at this period ; elles etaient empreintes d'une 
tristesse qu'il ressentait dans la solitude, et qui lui 
permettait de reflechir au pass^ si brillant, au pre- 
sent si triste, et h I'avenir si efFrayant pour lui; 
tristesse qu'il afFectait de rejetter loin de lui, d^s 
qu'il ^tait dans le monde, ayant I'air de braver la 
fortune, et de rire de ses coups." 

The description given by this lady of Brummeirs 
feelings when satire, and a worldly pride hitherto 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 265 

inflexible, had bent under the stern and unerring 
influence of conscience, is no doubt correct. Many 
circumstances confirm this supposition ; but perhaps 
the strongest testimony that, can be adduced to 
prove that the poor Beau had moments, nay hours, 
of regret and despondency, and that he brooded 
over what might have been his position, and what 
it then was, is the circumstance of his having in- 
serted the following lines in his common-place book. 
The page on which they were inscribed was fretted 
by frequent reference to them, and the asterisks 
placed against the first line in the margin plainly 
indicate that he often applied portions of them to 
his own feelings. 

" Doom'd as I am in solitude to waste 
The present moments and regret the past, 
Deprived of every joy I valued most, 
My friend torn from me, and my mistress lost — 
Call not this gloom I wear, this anxious mien, 
The dull effect of humour or of spleen. 
Still, still 1 mourn, with each returning day, 
Him snatch'd by fate in early youth away ; 
And her, through tedious years of doubt and pain, 
Fix'd in her choice, and faithful — but in vain. 
Oh ! prone to pity generous and sincere, 
Whose eye ne'er yet refused the wretch a tear ; 
Whose heart the real claims of friendship knows, 
Nor thinks a lover's are but fancied woes — 
See me, ere yet my destined course half done, 
Cast forth a wanderer on a world unknown ; 



266 THE LIFE OF 

See me neglected on the world's rude coast, 
Each dear companion of my voyage lost; 
Nor ask why clouds of sorrow shade my brow, 
And ready tears wait only leave to flow — 
Why all that soothes a heart from anguish free, 
All that delights the happy palls on me !" 

It would naturally be supposed that, on being 
released from jail, Brummell would be all attention 
to those who had been useful to him during his 
imprisonment, and to a few of his intimates, French 
and EngUsh, he expressed his thanks for their 
kindness ; but others he neglected altogether, and in 
general he appeared to think that by assuming an 
air of flippant indifference, he could throw a veil 
over the events of the last three months which had 
so much humiliated his vanity. 

One of his table d'hote acquaintance had, in his 
legal and official capacity, been of great service 
to him, and yet he was particularly neglectful to 
this individual, who was not without a fair share 
of repartee and professional acquirements ; but the 
Judge was weak enough to pique himself exces- 
sively on his horsemanship and dress instead, 
both of which were execrably bad — no tailor ever 
rode worse, and no tailor's block ever exhibited 
such a white macintosh ; it was so stiff", that 
when in the saddle he rattled Uke an armadillo 
out of repair. These were weighty objections to 



GEORGB BRUMMELL. 267 

cultivating his society ; but Brummell had a 
stronger and far more legitimate motive for dis- 
liking him : Monsieur B. actually kept a tooth- 
pick^ a permanent pinchbeck toothpick ! which, 
from its antique appearance, was evidently an heir- 
loom, and had probably belonged to his great- 
grandfather, and must therefore have been used 
to pick the ivories of four generations — disgusting 
idea. 

Such a habit any one would think atrocious, but 
the offence was venial to what follows : daily, after 
dinner, had the Beau seen the ** scoundrel," as he 
called him, premeditatedly — not in a fit of absence, 
pick his nails and his aural organs, with the same 
instrument ! Corpo di Bacco, this was indeed a 
most horrible practice; and no wonder that the 
remembrance of these enormities entirely prevented 
the development of Brummell's gratitude : not only 
did he never call upon him after his troubles 
were over, but he n^pver even sent him his card. 
About a fortnight, however, after he had regained 
his liberty, he met his learned acquaintance in the 
street, and, though he had not cared to take the 
trouble of calling upon him, he had no objection 
to faire les frais by a speech, he therefore appeared 
delighted to see him, and said, ** Ah, mon cher 
Ar^opagite, je suis desole de ne pas vous avoir fait 



268 THE LIFE OF 

ma petite visite ; mais le fait est, que mes cartes de 
visite, qui se font toujours k Londres, ne sont pas 
encore arriv^es." " Vraiment 1'* replied the angry 
and neglected gentleman, with as graceful a bow 
as a very stiff neckcloth, and the white macintosh, 
would permit him to make: " Ne vous d^rangez 
pas. Monsieur Brummell ; si vous m'aviez fait pet 
honneur, je n'aurais pas pu vous le rendre ; car pour 
le moment je suis aussi sans cartes, et les miennes 
se font en Chine." I am afraid there is good reason 
to suppose that Brummell was not particularly 
grateful to those who assisted him ; or, if he was, 
he did not certainly show it in his conversation. 
** Shortly after his imprisonment," says one of his 
Caen acquaintances, ^* I asked him if he had been 

as intimate with the Duke of C e as he was 

with his other brothers ; " when he replied, " The 
man did very well to wear a cocked hat, and walk 
about the quarter-deck crying *lufF;' but he was 
so rough and uncivilized that I was obliged to cut 
him. You may believe this when I tell you that 
he used to recount the amorous exploits in which 
he WAS engaged at Portsmouth, to the bishops and 
the ladies of the court at his father's table, and 
this to the inexpressible delight of the Prince of 
Wales and the Duke of York." The reader will 
bear in mind, that this incredible story was told 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 269 

after the late King had subscribed one hundred 
pounds towards eflFecting his release from prison, 
and it shows how little amiability was left in the 
mind of him who had been a recipient of his 
bounty ; but the Beau was a man of the world, and 
also a wit. 

Though Brummell was overmatched by the Judge, 
his critidsms were, generally speaking, quite as 
cutting, and his spirits apparently as good, as they 
had been before he was placed in durance. The 
letters which he wrote in the latter part of 1835, 
and early in 1836, do not betray any great fall- 
ing off in liveliness or piquancy : the following 
was sent with a present of game to a lady who 
had been kind to him during his imprisoment : — 

Hotel d'Angleterre, Friday. 

Une petite couv€e de perdreaux, vivant ce matin 
i Taube du jour, font vol sans haleine h. votre 
cuisine. 

When I had last the pleasure to see D * * * *, a 
week since, I was anxious to thank him for all 
his past kindness to me ; but the past still lingers 
upon my memory, and nothing but time, and 
other suns, and other scenes and occupations, ever 
can do me any effectual good. 

During the early period of my purgatory in the 



270 THE LIFE OF 

other world, there was, as you may have heard, 
a destructive incendie in a magazine of wood 
beneath my iron window. All the administering 
demons of these nether regions were upon the qui 
vive at this congenial /efe, and awaking from deceit- 
ful dreams of former Paradise, I rose from my 
straw, and attended their passage, which was 
through my cell, to the outward summit of the 
prison. Amidst the disheartening tumult that was 
raging, I distinctly heard a hoarse bewailing voice, 
in fear and tribulation frequently ejaculate, " Ah ! 
mon pauvre bijou ! Ma ch^re guillotine ! La leste 
coquine, elle va me quitter ! " I requested one of 
the fallen angels at my elbow to tell me whence 
came that extraordinary lament ? He replied, laugh- 
ing, " C'est Tamen de ce vieux gueux Joseph,*' who 
was, and had been, during twenty years, " bourreau 
en chef/' that he numbered upon his sanguinary 
fingers twenty-three human heads, and that he was 
more fondly attached ** k la machine encherie" than 
to his two sons, who were **aux galores k perpd- 
tuit^," — that it was his only hope and means of 
existence. Such is the theme and pretext for the 
four lines paraphrased from '* tes yeux bleus :" — 

C'EST LE BOURREAU QUI PARLE. 

Rien n'est plus toucbant que tes baisers ravissans, 
Ch^ Guillotine, par tes caresses de fer ! 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 271 

Ah ! pnlssent ces feux n'enflamment, ni le cruel sort condamnc, 
Comme toutes tes victimes, tes beaux jours aux Enfers ! 

I fear it is beyond expectation to encourage the 
thought of prevailing upon you to look in at the 
General's caserne ce soir for a charitable hour. In 
the meridian of sunshiny liberty,

As the reader may wish to know what are the 
lines that Brummell refers to, I have transcribed 
them here ; but from memory, and therefore they 
are probably incorrect; they have been ascribed 
to Voltaire : — 

** Rien n'est plus beau que tes yeux bleus, 

£nfant ! Tazur des cieux sourit sous ta paupiere : 
Ah ! puissent tes yeux bleus ne voit que la lumiere 
De jours purs, de jours doux comme eux.'' 

The next letter is to Monsieur Godefroi ; it was 
accompanied by some partridges that Brummell sent 
to him, as a little acknowledgment of the various 
civilities he had received from him in prison. 

Hotel d'Angleterre, Lundi.

rAmi de la Verite, 

Brummell's imprisonment did not decrease his 
notoriety, and the summer tourists, in search of 
churches and the tapestry at Bayeux, invariably 
passed a day at the H6tel d'Angleterre, and dined 
at the table d'hote. " Put me opposite to Mr. 
Brummell," was the constant request of these 
travellers; he was really a very good decoy, for 
he frequently joined in conversation with them, 
and told some of his old anecdotes with pleasant 
good-nature. The landlord, if he saw that his 
guests were ignorant that he had such a distin* 

VOL. II. T 



274 THE LIFE OF 

guished character in his house, never Tailed to 
make them aware of the fact : they were, however, 
decoyed to a capital dinner, for the hotel was, and 
is, the best in the town, the cookery unexception^ 
able, and at least twenty dishes, mcluding fish of 
two or three kinds, often made the^rcuit of the 
table. 

Bnimmell's love of eating and drinking were not 
diminished, and, as he had not the means, or credit, 
to indulge the latter at his own expense, he was far 
from averse to doing so at that of others. He, who 
had once been so exclusive, and a model of gentle- 
manly reserve, would now accept wine at the table 
d^hote, from perfect strangers ; Champagne was his 
favourite beverage, and, enlivened by its influence, 
he was still able to repay his entertainer with a 
few excellent stories. A man with a gaudy waist- 
coat, a cravat of embroidered satin, and a hand- 
ful of pearls in his pin, with whom, in former days, 
it would have been his death to dine — he was 
now very glad to see sit opposite to him, for he 
wa3 pretty sure of sharing his bottle. 

About this time, Mr. M * * * *, afterwards Lord 
p # # # #^ made the hotel his residence ; and as he 
was quite as great a gourmand as the Beau, the 
guests used to be not a little amused by the 
'*war to the knife," which took place between 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 275 

them. Many were the stratagems brought into 
play by the two gourmetSy in the endeavours of 
each to possess himself of the most delicate mor- 
sels. The wings of the fricasseed chickens were 
always in great request, and as his Lordship's son, 
a very good^^llow, but now no more, followed in 
his father's footsteps, Brummell, with two to one 
against him, was often left with the neck, or a 
drumstick: when this happened, his disgust was 
great, and giving a stem look, first at his youth- 
ful adversary, and then at the bones, he would 
send the dish indignantly away. 

His next letter was a perfect specimen of that 
accomplishment, generally supposed to be pecu- 
liarly characteristic of the epistolary intercourse of 
ladies — the art of writing a letter about nothing. 
It was addressed to the elder of his young friends, 
who was still absent in England. 

Thursday. 

You are, I am told, in serious dudgeon with 
me, for having neglected one of my most flatter- 
ing avocations, that of writing to you. If I was 
conscious of meriting this reprehension, I would 
solicit forgiveness on my prostrate knees, though 
it might be an idle position with this distance 
between us. May it please your more indulgent

consideration to learn, that during many a linger- 
ing week, I have not possessed a stray sentence 
of interest to impart to you, from these desolate 
regions of mnui ; and, that if I had vainly attempted 
to divert your attention with my local fades ]6t6' 
miades, you would have found them as dreary and 
insipid, as the monotonous sorrows of your old 
friend and pagan idolater, Werter. You are too 
amiable, and too merciful in your judgments, to 
attribute the neglect of my accused silence to the 
imputation of forgetfulness of you ; believe me, 
and I speak with simple truth, the deep interest 
that I have always felt for you has never deviated 
from my remembrance ; and if you could suppose 
that your lamented absence from this place has 
for an hour escaped my best thoughts, you do 
me an injustice. 

I had for months cherished the hope that you 
would, ere this, have returned. That expectation 
is still, I find, to be procrastinated during another 
month : you will then really revisit us ; and none 
will welcome your restored presence with more 
honest cordiality and implicit faith in your kindly 
feelings towards me, than 

Your very sincere friend.

CHAPTER XXII. 

Bnimmeirs young favourite returns to Caen— Letters to her — The Beau

In the autumn, the young lady, to whom the pre- 
ceding letter was addressed, returned to Caen, and 
he lost no time in showing the pleasure he felt in 
again seeing her, by recommencing his occupation 
of drawing for her album. 

Saturday. 

You are, I dare say, anxious for your album, and 
1 am mutilating its pages in attempting to draw and 
write upon them. I know not how it is, but I can- 
not design upon leaves that are bound. 

Yesterday, I sketched three figures — you, and 
# # # #^ ^^^ # # # # J ii^Q^ gQt out of temper with 

my labours, and tore out the leaf: do not be angry 
with me for this piece of delinquency ; I will make 
it up tenfold to you upon more propitious paper. 
I am wishing to portray you and * * * * together, 
but though my memory is accurate in regard to 



278 THE LIFE OF 

yourself, 1 have not * * * * sufficiently impressed 
upon it to achieve anything that would gratify you. 
Let me but still have health, and you shall, sans 
vanite\ be contented with me. I have no drawings 
left in my possession — they have all been given 
away, perhaps to thankless persons — except a few 
miniatures encddresj perfectly uninteresting to my- 
self as well as to you. The only one left is r half- 
finished crayon, which I began some years ago, as 
a model for another, which I accomplished after- 
wards in colours; it is the late poor Duchess of 
Rutland ; we were great friends in those days, you 
must know, and so, indeed, we remained till her 
death, ten years since. Pray have a respect for 
her, and protect her, now she is no more — at least, 
in naming her, do not let her be approached by 
sacrilegious eyes and hands : of courge I do not 
mean * * * * and * * * *, for I have every confidence 
in them ; but there are others who sometimes sur- 
round you, and, I can assure you, when the original 
was living, she was never profaned by the familiar 
contact of gens de cette irempe. 

I would rather have written the two copies of 
verses addressed to you, than all the rest of the con- 
tents of your album; they are pure, natural, and 
beautiful poetry ; and I am quite in love with *=<*=** 
for having so delightfully done you justice. As to 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 279 

the rest of the productions, they are generally of 
that ephemeral embroidery, of that postiche pseudo- 
class of dissembled French sentiment which has 
nothing to recommend it but the crowquill ; and has 
neither heart, nor soul, nor genuine meaning, nor, 
above all, delicacy in it. 

Ever yours most sincerely, 

A Mademoiselle , G. B. 

Rue . 

This is a severe critique upon the French poetry 
in an album, but there are many persons who will 
not think it too much so. Even the stanzas of 
their great poet, M. de la Martine, are rather som- 
niferes ; beautiful, indeed, when read line by line, 
but as good as an opiate when taken en masse. The 
Beau cuts up the matter as keenly as Lord Byron 
did the sound of their rhymes, when, in alluding 
to this subject, or, rather, to their poetry in general, 
he called it " that whetstone of the teeth — monotony 
in wire!" — one tone, and that tone a wire one! 
Alas ! Another drawing accompanied the next 
letter. 

Wednesday evening. 
Daignez agreez Voffrande du7ie esquisse pour voire

deeply shaded, and that fault has been unavoidable 
from the maudit papier qui buvait, as they say, when- 
ever my contending crayon came in contact (pretty 
alliteration) with its spongy surface. Receive it as 
it is ; the only merit to which it may pretend is, its 
being original; as you said of some of my other 
productions, I never copied anything or anybody. 
I am going on with two others in all the colours of 
the rainbow, and with happier sunshine in their 
countenances, which will be pltis digne of your 
acceptance. 

Do not consider me impertinent or irregular^ 
but you are the only person existing for whom I 
would give myself this trouble, and you deserve 
it, at least I think so, which will do as well. Deny 
me not your thanks for the drawing ; and if you 
are the same amiable creature that you used to 
be in our earlier acquaintance, tell me, that 1 may 
still cherish the faith of existing sempre in your 
continued friendship. 

You were, I trust, amused yesterday evening, 
au cirque; you must, no doubt, have been so, by 
the refined society around you. I will simply, 
yet humbly ask you. Were you, during your ab- 
sence in England, exposed to the intercourse of 
any compeers resembling it ? You will, I am con- 
fident, answer, with a forgiving smile — ^Never ! 

I have just received your charming note. I

shall not attempt to answer it till I have taken my 
laudanum, and surpassed the prolonged doze of the 
Seven Sleepers ; to go without it would be suicide, 
from neglecting the high fever excited by your 
flattery. Pray have the kindness to whisper to 
Madame, (and if she has forgotten the circumstance 
I shall be equally contented,) that cejuifd'Ison made 
me pay him for Pantaleone's billets ; she might con-

personally to her. The best of nights to you.

In 1835, the same soirees and the same whist 
parties were held as in preceding winters, his own

Upon ransacking other debris of former times, I 
cannot find any note-keepers in better preservation

284 THE LIFE OF 

Brummell affected to have had a great admiration 
and friendship for Lady W * * * *, and this was pro- 
bably the reason why he remembered the following 
anecdote, with so much precision as, nearly half a 
century after, he detailed it to me. We were talk- 
ing of the various coincidences that sometimes 
take place in the fulfilment of gipsy predictions, 
when he said that the most extraordinary instance 
of the kind he had ever heard of, he himself wit- 
nessed ; and that Lady Sarah S**** was the heroine 
of the story foretold. It appears that her Ladyship 
and a large party, of which the Beau formed a 
conspicuous item, proceeded, one summer's after- 
noon, on a picnic to Norwood. 

In those days, that rural spot, now covered with 
bricks and mortar, was a great rendezvotis of the 
daughters of prophecy, who were always lurking 
under the greenwood tree, and in its sequestered 
glades, equally ready to cross the hand of the high- 
born dame, or of the humble spider-brusher. After 
their repast alfresco, the *' famiUarisers with wasps 
and ear-wigs" rambled about, and, as usual, one of 
the swarthy Egyptians came towards the party, and 
offered her services. Lady Sarah accepted them, 
and the gipsy, taking her hand, and examining 
the lines, told her, with an accuracy of detail quite 
surprising, that she would marry a nobleman, the

description of whose person corresponded exactly 
with that of Lord Monson ; she also predicted his 
death, and her ladyship's second marriage, stating 
the time that would elapse between the two events, 
every circumstance of which came to pass in the 
manner which she had prophesied. I have heard 
Brummell tell this story more than once ; it seemed 
to have made a deep impression upon him : indeed 
I feel almost certain that he was rather superstitious 
on the point. The remaining letters in this chapter 
were addressed to the same lady as the preceding 
one. 

Monday. 
Du Pille has just left me ; he will be charm^ to 
be with you to-morrow evening, and I wUl bring 
him at half-past eight. Monsieur de Valmont told 
me he was dying with anxiety to be pri^ to your 
soiree. He said he had in the morning met a Mon- 
sieur O'Gradig, (he pronounced the name as you 
do Zadig,) who promised to intercede with you for 
his admission. He requested me to add my endea- 
vours to O'Gradig's solicitation. You may, perhaps, 
have seen this chevalier at Luc during the last or 
the previous summer. I can only say of him that 
he is a Norman gentleman, well known to all the 
French residents here. He is also young and gay, 
though his personal recommendations are rather

dilapidated, and there is no fear of his making any 
serious impressions -on your fair daughters. 

Ten days since, I sent to Paris for Bulwer*s last 
production, which I saw advertised — ^not yet arrived : 
also I desired the " Prairie," by Washington Irving, 
announced, but I do not believe published. 

The " Two Friends" dreadfully tedious. I wish 
you well through their acquaintance. Lady B****n, 
in the wane of her days, like all reformed saints of 
her class, is getting too severely penitent, and suf- 
focates one with assumed morality. If you have 
still a book unread by me, illuminate me by the 
loan of it. 

Lefrere lai, Mr. W * * * *, on his way to matins, 
told me you were favourably convalescent this morn- 
ing : he went so far as to say, that an hour's airing 
on the Cours, in the dviere de VH6pitaly would by 
no means be detrimental to you. 

Send back my missive to seal in the morning, 
for I dine out to-day, and pass my midnight with 
Madame de Temps ; and I shall be trop epuise to 
crawl out of my shell in time to call chez votis with 
the summons of chanticleer. 

Always yours,

Thursday. 

You cannot, in reference to . , mean to de- 
signate me as your treacherous Guy Faux, when 
you date your note the morning of the gunpowder 
plot. I can assure you I am too faithful a Pro- 
testant in my professions. 

Our blanchisseuse tells me this morning, with 
tears of turpentine trickling down her cheeks of 
deal, that *' Madame * * * * va bient6t partir jamais 
k revenir parmi nous." It is deplorable how this 
class of persons enjoy the propensity to remind one 
of disagreeable subjects. The man in the street 
tells me you purpose taking up your future quarters 

at B towards Christmas : if this is authentic, 

without whispering it in Gath, I shall be there 
before you. 

Always your shade,

Tuesday. 

I hear that you have been indisposed : if that is 
the case, do not go and throw yourself away on 
Cautez's fiddle this evening. 

Yesterday I was reposing in amicable tete-drtete 
with '^ Japhet," when 1 heard the Venetian ballad 
of " La Biondina" humming upon the stairs ; in 



288 THE LIFE OF 

walked Alfred de Launay with the Quotidienne in 
his hand, to show me a paragraph in which I was 
named. I send it to you for your amusement a 
dejeuner. It is the most prepostlfccous fabrication 
that ever was transcribed; no truth, no humour, 
no accuracy of date in the period. Return the 
paper to me when you have read it, as he is anxious 
to repossess it. 

Whenever from inadvertency, for I am incapable 
of the intention, I have been guilty of any impro- 
priety or unbecoming bad taste, I am vexed till it is 
acknowledged by myself, and, if possible, expiated. 
I had forgotten that the contemptible jeu de 
mots, " Broken Beau," was extant au pied de 
Vesquisse, which I had taken the liberty to offer for 
your album, till D * * * * asked me yesterday what 
the meaning was in French ; of course I answered 
simply, " Tare cass^." These ridiculous words 
were written in a moment of haste, and with no 
other idea than being laughed at by you as a mau- 
vaise plaisanteriey not to be seen by others. I 
entreat you instantly to erase the words in ques- 
tion, or throw the sketch into the fire. I will 
make you a hundred others in lieu of it. 

If you are out to-morrow when I call, send me 
the book in the evening. To-day I am too much 
subdued by the shadows of Valombrosa, at Madame 



GEORGK BRUMMELL. 289 

de Seran's last night, to hold up my head if I saw 
you. I shall take to rouge if this goes on. 
Most sincerely yours,

Rue . 

The frontispiece of this volume is a fac-simile 
of the esquisse to which Brummell refers in the 
preceding letter, and which he might, with more 
propriety, have denominated an elaborate drawing, 
for it was in hand several months ; and when the 
reader is reminded that it was done when he was 
nearly sixty years of age, and in spectacles, he 
must, I think, admit that it is an admirable per- 
formance — the finish of it is nearly equal to one of 
Gerard Dow's birch brooms. Though Brummell 
says that he never copied any one, or any thing, 
this effort of his pencil was, I believe, taken from 
some miserable French print. If the hands were 
original, it is difficult to say why he made the 
fingers so much resemble claws ; unless he meant 
to insinuate that poor Cupid, in the depth of his 
affliction, was actually lacerating his own flesh. 

The anxiety he displayed to repossess this draw- 
ing, arose, perhaps, from the disinclination he felt 
to have his pun seen by the lady's friends. In 
Granby, Lister assures us, that when the pragma- 

VOL. II. u 



290 THE LIFE OF 

tical Mr. Bennett let one off, Trebeck rewarded him 
with a look that ought to have annihilated him, for 
that, in his estimation, such a species of wit was 
the extreme pitch of bad manners ; and, in truth, 
Brummell did not often indulge in puns. He showed, 
however, great want of judgment in requesting that 
the drawing might be returned, and his entreaty 
was of course negatived ; for the lady whom he thus 
favoured was young, very young, and naturally 
refused to part with a Cupid whose bow was 
broken. Since that period, however, the weapon 
has been repaired, the tears dried, and the fair pos- 
sessor has fallen a happy victim to the young 
urcliin*s malice ; while the esquisse still remains in 
her album, a striking allegorical memento of the 
poor old man who drew thus playfully, but, alas ! 
truthfully, a picture of himself and his broken for- 
tunes. The anecdote of which he speaks, as appear- 
ing in the Quotidienne, was that of, *' Greorge, ring 
the bell." 

January 1st, 1836. 

The infidels have frustrated my expectations ; 
they have sent me but one annual from Paris, and 
they prevaricate by saying, no other has been 
imprim^.

that would be comparative and familiar. De plus, 
she may be more immediately deficient in the dispo- 
sition and the means a chasser de sa souvenance 
Fombre et rennui qui la d^sole. The moon emaciates 
just now, sympathizing only in profile ; and they

it will be but an inconsiderable time I shall lan-

Mademoiselle * * * *. 

^ There is a gentleman starting for Albion on Fri- 
day or Saturday ; he swears he is the soul of pro- 
bity, and I do not think his physiognomy would 
hang him. He will take charge of the paquet, and 
salute the book at the douane that they are for his 
nearest relations, and that the jupon en sole has 
experienced twenty gallopades. You must address 
them in your own autograph, for I would not 
denote my ways of confidence to the walls of 
Babylon. 

My nervous compatriote has just come in ; he has 
lived so long at Madrid, that he dreads the Inquisi- 
tion even at Southampton. He consents to take over 
the annual, and a note enclosed in it. His courage 
declines about the jupon, though I have sworn there 
is no lace, heresy, or treason, concealed in its folds. 
Send, then, back the book, that I may entrust it to 
the provident traveller.

Mine was the " Rake's Progress " last night, and

The following note is the last that Brummell wrote 
ta one of the most intimate and kind friends he had 
at Caen, and, with the exception of a few letters to 
Mr. Armstrong, it closes his correspondence. 

Saturday. 

It disappointed me much not to shake hands 
with you en adieux yesterday : it was, perhaps, the 
last occasion I shall find in this world, to express 
my devoted gratitude to you and yours, for all your

to * * *, and while you enact the chaperon, with 
all commendable discretion, do not forget the spirit

of indulgence for youthful feeling that pervades 
the lines in my old album, ** Oh ! let the young 
enthusiast stray :" tell her also, for it is the simple, 
unassuming truth, that wherever I may hereafter 
sojourn, far away, she will never for an hour be for- 
gotten by me. Adieu ! and may you all be happy ! 
God bless you. 

Ever sincerely yours,

The following are the stanzas to which Brummell 
here alludes ; they are inserted anonymously in his 
album : — 

Oh, let the young enthusiast stray 
Through fancy's rainbow-tinted way ; 
Let her light footsteps gaily rove 
The fairy paths of joy and love ; 
Let her the world delighted view, 
And think the flattering vision true. 
Think every heart she e'er has known 
As pure, as artless as her own ! 

Why dim the lustre of her eye ? 
Why draw the unnecessary sigh ? 
To her, young life seems full of charms, 
She dreams secure in pleasure's arms ; 
Fancy and hope their gifts dispense, 
Angelic guards of innocence ; 
Awhile life's hateful truths forego, 
Nor wake her to a world of woe ! 



294 THE LIFE OF GEORGB BRUMMELL. 

But, when maturer age appears 
With cautious step, and crown'd with cares, 
When first the long- worn path she tries, 
Where sorrow, like a serpent lies, 
Lurking heneath some fond delight. 
And rears her withering form to light ; 
When, shuddering at the direful view. 
She turns her tearful eye on you : — 

When, douhting, with her hopes at strife, 
She trembling asks, if such be life ? 
Then clasp thy daughter to thy breast. 
Then soothe thy mourner into rest ; 
In gentler terms the truth unfold, 
Th' unwilling truth, that must be told, 
The fated ills life must endure, 
And comfort, when you cannot cure ! 



CHAPTER XXIII. 

Mdancfaoly prospects — ^The state of Bnimmell's affairs — Letters to Mr. 
Armstrong — " Le vemis de Guiton" — A revolution — The black cravat— 
Brammell's description of his position at this period— His new dressing- 
gown — '* Le conunenoement' de la fin" — ^The memonr fails— The dinner 
at Mrs. 6 's — Bmmmell's appearance at the table d'hSte. 

With the departure of this family, the correspond- 
ence which had so much contributed to enliven 
many of BrummelPs lonely evenings ceased entirely, 
for that which he had hitherto kept up with other 
friends became, by degrees, much less frequent, 
probably in consequence of his growing infirmities. 
The remainder of my task is to relate an uninter- 
rupted narrative of misfortunes rapidly succeed- 
ing each other, and increasing in severity — an 
accumulation of distresses, in purse, of body and 
of mind. The allowance remitted to Mr. Arm- 
strong by his relations and friends, for his main- 
tenance, was one hundred and twenty pounds 
per annum, and half of this sum was paid to the 
landlord of the H6tel d'Angleterre, for board and 
lodging ; only sixty pounds therefore remained, for 
wine, firing, washing and clothes, besides the inci- 



296 THE LIFE OF 

dental expenses of sickness, and various others, 
which his pecuUar habits involved. 

This income would certainly have been sufficient 
for many a single man in France, but it required 
to be managed with strict economy, and would 
not provide the multitude of et ceteras necessary 
to the Beau's comfort. On leaving his prison, he 
immediately fell into his old habits on almost all 
points ; he had, it is true, brought himself down 
to one complete change of linen daily ; but he 
could not find in his heart to renounce his prim- 
rose gloves, eau de ColognCy oil for his wigs, and 
patent blacking. Various and repeated were the 
remonstrances that were made to him, but with 
little effect; bills for those articles were run up 
without a thought, and it was not till their 
amount threatened a repetition of the events of 
the summer of 1835, that he paid any attention 
to them. The following notes are specimens of 
his repentance, on such occasions. 

November, 1836. 

My dear Armstrong, 

Mulet, the boot-maker, has this instant been 

with me, in an insolent manner, and says that as 

you have refused positively to pay his account, 

or the principal part of it, for vernis, he shall 



6EORQB BRUMMELL. 297 

proceed against me for the amoant of this debt^ 
without it is settled the present day. Send me 
the money on my own account, and let me instantly 
settle it. I have, so help me Heaven, not four 
francs in my possession, and it will utterly destroy 
me to see a bailiff enter my room, or assault me 
in the street. 

I will enter into any promise with you upon the 
subject of this d — d polish, that you may demand, 
if you will instantly enable me to pay this scoun- 
drel. 

Most truly yours, 

A Monsieur Armstrong, ^* li- 

Rue St. Jean. 

This vernis de Guilon, which was five francs a 
bottle, he used to have ordered for him expressly 
from Paris. 

December, 1886. 

Dear Armstrong, 

Do not any more be out of temper with me. 
1 do not deserve it from you ; I have never tres- 
passed upon the rules of economy which you 
dictated to me, excepting in one instance, and 
that has been that d— d execrable blacking. I 
have now; relinquished it for ever! 

You are of too good a natural disposition to 



298 THE LIFE OF 

be displeased with any part of my conduct in 

this place, during our more intimate acquaintance 

in this last year. So help me Heaven, I have 

never trespassed from the economy you dictated 

to me, and when I have solicited assistance from 

the utter want of necessaries, the request has 

never been solicited by my applications but from 

positive need. Let our good friendship remain 

between us as it has ever yet done, and you will 

never have reason to repent it. 

You must not be again exasperated with me, 

when I make solicitations for your most friendly 

assistance, for you shall not have reason for it; 

and at this moment, I am not ashamed to tell 

you candidly, that I have not two sous remaining 

of the twenty francs you had the goodness to 

send me. 

Most sincerely yours, 

A Monsieur Armstrong, G, B. 

Rue St* Jean. 

The last of these letters relates to his -specula- 
tions in the lottery, a species of gambling, in which 
he frequently indulged both at Calais and Caen, 
and at the former place with considerable success. 

Dbiar Armstrong, 
You have hurt me more than I can express 



GEOROE BRUMMBLL. 299 

by your note to me this morning. I put down this 
infernal debt to the lottery-office, because I would 
conceal nothing from you — it amounted to its pre- 
sent amount, from my inability to pay three original 
misesy and I desisted from continuing to add to 
the insane obligation at the close of the last year. 
I am, believe me^ sensibly ashamed of myself for 
this act of past folly — and if you overlook it, and 
still promise me your services, both here and in 
England, I give you my sacred word of honour, 
I will never again commit such an extravagant 
and senseless error. 

I will endeavour to write, the instant I am re- 
stored to calmness, to the Duke of Devonshire, 
and, with your permission, I will send you the 
letter for conveyance to England. 

It would afflict me to suppose that my imme- 
diate imfortunate affiurs interfered with your bet- 
ter interests in other quarters ; * but do not allow 
the precipitate anger of the moment, in regard to 
the past insanity of speculating in the lottery, to 
damp and destroy your friendly efforts to save 

me. Write to 

Yours, 

A Monsieur Armstrong, G. B. 

Rue St. Jean. 

* Brummell here alludes to the Vice Consulship, which Mr. 
Armstrong obtained through his interest. 



300 THE LIFE OF 

Such were the solemn assurances the Beau gave 
of future retrenchment ; hills for luxuries and su- 
perfluities were, however, continually presented to 
Mr. Armstrong for payment ; and he was at length 
obliged to check this expenditure, by giving out 
in the town, that no such accounts would be set- 
tled by him, but such as he thought reasonable, 
on being submitted to his supervision. He also 
obhged the Beau to reduce his washing, which 
was an expensive item ; such cleanliness as a shirt 
and neckcloth every day being, in his eyes, great 
extravagance, when to Brummell they were indis- 
pensable. Not long after this a great change took 
place in his personal appearance. A lady told him, 
in a jocular manner, that his looks would be im- 
proved by a black cravat: he went immediately to his 
purveyor, and, having obtained his permission to 
purchase one, to the amazement of his friends— he 
had now no enemies — he appeared the next morn- 
ing in the Rue St. Jean, in what had all his life 
been his particular aversion — a black silk hand- 
kerchief ! 

The lady's advice, though carelessly given, was 
good ; for his white neckcloths, at this period, were 
always soiled, and covered with snufF; and it was 
perhaps the consciousness of the change in the 
appearance of his linen, that induced him to fall in 
with it so easily. His tie, the one, the only one. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 301 

that he had clung to with affection all his life, 
was now dissolved ; and Brummell may be figura- 
tively said to have expired that day — starch and 
cambric had become to him matters of history. 
I am very sorry it is not in my power to give 
those of his admirers who are curious in chro- 
nology the exact date on which this startling in- 
cident took place. The decayed and diminished 
state of his wardrobe, that he had now no pro- 
spect of replenishing, was probably an additional 
reason for such a dereliction of former principles ; 
for, judging by the next and last note that I was 
able to collect of the unfortunate Beau's, it is very 
likely that his superfine cambric cravats, those that 
were possibly the gift of his friend King Allen, had 
now become mere visions of the past. 

Dear Armstrong, 

It is, I can assure you, with the greatest reluc- 
tance I am compelled to solicit occasional assist- 
ance from you ; but I told you the truth yesterday, 
when I represented the abject condition of my 
linen to you. I have not a single shirt that will 
hang to my back^ nor are my socks and drawers 
in a better state. 

After what you have most kindly done for me, 
I cannot attribute my almost total want of the 



302 THE LIFE OF 

means to purchase any necessary, however trifling, 
to a disinclination on your part to serve me. I 
would rather he d — d, than ask for anything that 
was not readily accorded; and therefore I can 
assure you, that it is with pain I have latterly heen 
obliged to make requests to you. After the ex- 
perience I have met with in this place, I have a 
horror of contracting new debts ; and yet, during 
the last two months, I have not possessed five 
francs for the most indispensable purposes. I am 
in ignorance as to those who, through your media- 
tion, have befriended me on the other side of the 
water, nor do I know precisely the atnount of 
their contributions ; therefore I am unable to write 
to them my thanks for what they have done, or 
to make them acquainted with my continued des- 
titute situation; — the belly, indeed, is filled, but 
the hand is empty, and the back and limbs un- 
provided for. 

I have not heard from any one of them, ex- 
cepting, as you know, from'^my sister ; and I could 
almost suppose she was laughing at me, when she 
says she hopes that I "have everything comfort- 
able about me." Surely, my dear Armstrong, I 
had better immediately write to her, to Alvanley, 
and to others : they may imagine I am living 
comparatively in comfort, if not at ease, and the 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 303 

positive reverse is the case ; and I see it cannot last 

long with me. 

Yours, 

A Monsieur Armstrong, G. B. 

Rue St. Jean. 

Brummell's necessities were partially attended 
to ; hut his caterer's taste in hahiliments does not 
appear to have met with his approbation ; instead 
of a shawl dressiM^-grown, that he had applied for, 
suitable for winter wear, a cotton one was sent 
to him, of an ordinary description : — ^this he had 
no sooner unfolded, than he rushed angrily to the 
window, wad threw it out ; and in its gyrations and 
flutterings, on its way from the third story to the 
pavement, it as seriously alarmed the passengers 
and horses of tho^ Bayeux diligence, as it had dis- 
gusted its owner up-stairs. After reading the pre- 
ceding note, no one can suppose that Brummell was 
comfortable; certainly not, according to the con- 
struction that he would put upon the word ;— *ut 
his sensitiveness on si^pt subjects was not destined 
to be of much longer duration. 

Though he could, in the winter of 1836, collect 
his ideas sufficiently to write a letter, or speak with 
point on any subject that struck him forcibly, those 
who knew him intimately observed that his im- 
prisonment had shaken his intellect to an extent 



304 THE LIFE OF 

hitherto quite unsuspected. In speaking of that 
unfortunate episode in his life, he would point to 
his head and say that he had received a blow there 
from which he should never recover ; and it was 
now evident that his mind was becoming gradually 
but seriously impaired. 

His memory was the first faculty that failed him ; 
and, in the early part of the following year, his 
good and mediocre stories were told over and over 
agam to the same person : in the words of his own 
letter to his young protdgee^ he became " drawling 
from prolixity." This is doubtless one of the 
usual infirmities of age, but of old age^; whereas 
Brummell was at this period only entering his six- 
tieth year, though he had the appearance of a man 
of seventy-five. His fits of absence became daily 
more frequent, and the remarks he would sometimes 
make, when in this half-conscious state, were truly 
ludicrous, if the term may be used under such dis- 
tressing circumstances; but it was almost impos- 
sible to suppress an occasional smile. One evening, 
absorbed in the contemplation of a blazing fire at 
the house of a friend, and sitting next to two ladies, 
who were carrying on a desultory conversation near 
him, he heard the lady of the mansion gently chide 
her companion for having left her daughter by the 
sea-side alone, upon which he broke silence by 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 305 

audibly observing to himself, " there is no necessity 
for being alarmed ; she is too plain for any body to 
dream of running off with her.'' 

As his mind became weaker, he frequently forgot 
to whom he was speaking. In an English family, 
the members of which were extremely hospitable 
and kind to him, (not only from a humane feeling, 
but from his having been known to his friend when 
the latter was in the Guards many years before,) 
he wandered to a degree that gave rise to a most 
awkward scene. One day this gentleman gave a 
large dinner party, to which Brummell was invited, 
and his wife, who was proud, and justly so, of her 
talent in storing her larder with good things, had been 
indefatigable in her endeavours to make this par- 
ticular entertainment pass off well. She had super- 
intended and organized the fete; she had, like many 
ladies in France, gone to market herself and chosen 
her own turkey; and lastly, she had solemnly 
charged her cook not to put the fish on till the 
company had arrived. 

Every wish of her guests, and every contretemps 
had been anticipated with truly Enghsh good nature, 
and as the dinner was announced she very naturally 
flattered herself that every one would find every 
thing more than complete ; and therefore, when she 
entered the dining-room, in all the confidence of 

VOL. II. X 



306 THE LIFE OF 

presumed success, she threw a complacent and 
approving smile across her well-provided table. 
Brummell, who led her to the scene of her triumph, 
sat next to her; but he had scarcely taken his 
place when he commenced criticising every dish 
that steamed before him, *' What is that?" he 
inquired, pointing to one near him. '* Filet saute 
aux champignons J ^ replied his opposite neighbour: 
he tasted it, and immediately sent his plate away, 
murmuring "how tough!'' Another dish he con- 
demned as cold, and a third as execrable ; and look- 
ing at the bottom of the table remarked, in a loud 
aside, " What a half-starved turkey!" The host 
looked indignant, the guests surprised, and, gentle 
reader, the lady — the lady wept ! At length Brum- 
melFs peevishness and grumbling subsided, and he 
ate — ay, he ate voraciously. 

The fact was the poor fellow had been all this 
time under the delusion that he was at the table 
d'hote^ where he never failed to find fault with every 
thing, though, as I have before said, the fare was 
excellent, and where, malgrd his complaints, he 
consumed enormous quantities of food. 

His vagaries frequently attracted the attention of 
every person at the public table, and brought all 
eyes upon him. Sometimes he would transfix the 
portion of fricandeau before him with his fork, and 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 307 

elevating the larded morsel in the air, stare wisely 
at it, shake his head, and exclaim, '' Bah !" hut in 
the next minute the condemned slice of calf had 
disappeared. It may easily he imagined that these 
exhibitions, though they might for a moment divert 
the lookers-on, were never pleasing to the landlord, 
who, according to the Fjreiich custom, was always 
present to do the honours.

Brummell also became totally indifFerent to his per- 
sonal appearance : not only were his clothes shabby 
and out of repair, but he was dirty. His tailor told 
me that, towards the close of his career, he had some- 
times observed him in the street with his coat in 
holes under the arms, and his trousers torn. '' J'avais 
honte," said Monsieur * * * *, assuming a dignified 
air, " de voir un homme si c^^bre et si distingu^, 
et qui s'^tait cr^ une place dans Thistoire, dans un 
^tat si malheureux ; and though I could not afford 
to give him clothes, I frequently requested him to 
send me his things, and mended them for nothing." 
On such occasions poor Brummell was under the 
necessity of remaining in bed till his trowsers were 
sent home to him by the friendly tailor, for he had 
only one pair. The waiter who usually brushed his 
clothes, said that he was without a second pair

daring the last two years and a half that he re- 
mained at the hotel, and that he had observed 
Brummell occupied in mending them at least a year 
before he became imbecile. 

The landlady of the hotel likewise informed me, 
that his linen was " en lambeaux,'' his boots percees, 
He had, indeed, passed the point at which he 
had been the personification of a broken-down 
gentleman ; his manners were, it is true, the same 
as ever, but he who had been the perfection of 
neatness and cleanliness, was now the very reverse 
— ^he was a complete sloven: in winter, however, 
his old cloak, which he constantly wore, covered 
all his rags, and then his appearance was not so 
wretched. 

Though he had long given up his darUng vernis 
de GuitoUy nothing could induce him to forego eau 
de Cologne^ oil for his wig, and biscuits de Rkeims, 
for his luncheon ; and as he could not obtain 
credit for these coveted articles, for Mr. Armstrong 
declined paying for them, he used occasionally to 
beg them at the shops where he had formerly 
dealt. As long as he could get out he went to 
a confectioner's in front of the hotel every day 
at two o'clock, to eat two of his favourite biscuits, 
which were always flavoured with a glass of cu- 
ra9oa, or maraschino : for some time, they were 



310 THIi LIFE OF 

paid for with a bow, but this polite remuneration 
did not long satisfy Monsieur Magdelaine^ and 
Brummell, to satisfy his penchant, now a passion, 
was obliged to sell or pawn the few valuables he 
had left. 

For this purpose, and also to procure perfumery, 
he disposed of a handsome gold repeater to an 
Englishman of the name of Pitt, a tulle manufac- 
turer of the town ; it had originally cost eighty 
guineas, and was now sold for a very small sum : 
who negotiated the sale, or how he became ac- 
quainted with Mr.. Pitt, no one appears to have 
known : he was not likely to have come personally 
in contact with him. 

Some porcelain vases, another watch, seals, and 
a chain, and other articles of jewellery, were parted 
with in like manner, and even his last silver snuff- 
box was pledged to Monsieur Magdelaine, to in- 
dulge his puerile passion for biscuits de Rheims. The 
box was redeemed after his death by Mr. Arm- 
strong, and is, I believe, still in his possession. 
It was singular, that he never would dispose of 
these articles of bijouterie to his equals — friends 
that he was daily in the habit of seeing. A gen- 
tleman once offered him a handsome sum for his 
ormolu greyhound, but he refused it, saying, "if 
you are interested about it, pray accept it ; but I 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 311 

don't sell it." A few years before, he was not so 
scrupulous, and at a still later period he did not 
object to receive, nay to beg for money from his 
friends : one young Frenchman, of my intimate 
acquaintance, assisted him with many a five-franc 
piece. The decay of his intellect when it really 
began to fail, was rapid, and at the close of 
1837, the period to which the foregoing remarks 
particularly apply, poor Brummell had quite ceased 
to be a wit — he was only half-witted. Many of 
those who had previously sought his society with 
eagerness, now studiously avoided him ; for he was, 
in the idiom of our language, a great bore, and 
the sarcasm that he once unmercifully dealt to 
others, was now levelled at himself — in utter dis- 
regard of his mental helplessness. A ci-devant 
French associate, who was sitting next to him at 
a Philharmonic concert this winter, alluding to 
the perpetual movement of his lower jaw, which 
had become habitual since the loss of his teeth, 
addressed him thus, " Mon cher Brummell, s'il faut 
absolument que vous mitchiez, du moins machez 
en mesure." At the soirees which he occasionally 
attended, previously to his disappearing from so- 
ciety entirely, some of his acquaintance would ask 
him in a satirical tone, '' how he got invited ? " 
and he was doomed to see himself the sport of an 



312 THE LIFE OF 

English schoolboy's pencil, whose caricature of him 
was lithographed, and distributed about the town ; 
the same youth also wrote the following doggerel 
verses, which were circulated with it. 

" Keen blows the wind, and piercing is the cold; 
My pins are weak, and I am growing old ; 
Around my shoulders this worn cloak I spread. 
With an umbrella to protect the head, 
Which once had wit enough to astound the world, 
But now, possesses nought but wig well-curl'd. 
Alas ! alas ! while wind and rain do beat. 
That great Beau Brummell thus should walk the street !" 

These gibes were aJl so many nails in his coffin, 
for he had still the consciousness to feel, though not 
the power to reply to them ; and latterly, as he 
crept, in the evenings, with tottering and feeble 
steps, along the side of the street, supporting him- 
self by the wall, on his way to the house of Mr. 

B n, the very children mocked and jeered 

him, so odd and deplorably forlorn was his ap- 
pearance. This gentleman's door was open to him 
to the last, as it had been ever since Brummell 
arrived in Caen, and his absence, of an evening, 
though dirty, and any thing but entertaining, would 
have made a blank in their domestic circle. ** How 
can you admit such a driveller?" said an ill-condi- 
tioned cur to the kind-hearted lady of this hospi- 



OEORGB BRUMMELL. 313 

table mansion. " He is never in our way, sir," she 
replied, " and though it is true he is no longer the 
amusing character he used to be, I like to see him 
take his seat before my fire." On these occasions 
poor Brummell slept soundly, and he was never 
disturbed till the refreshing gunpowder was poured 
out. 

An event occurred during this winter which 
proved that there was still, in some distant quarter, 
one, who either took an interest in his condition, 
or had an unaccountable curiosity to see the ruin 
before it fell. This was a lady, who arrived one 
cold and gloomy morning, without equipage, ser- 
vant, or luggage, at the H6tel d'Angleterre. The 
stranger was of a. certain age, and plainly dressed, 
but her air and manners indicated that she had 
moved in the highest circles. Seeing this elegant 
apparition pass the window of his bureau, the 
watchful landlord went out into the yard to her 
rencontre, when she requested that he would show 
her to a private room. He did so, and was about 
to retire; but she desired him to remain, and 
requested to know if Mr. Brummell was still living 
in his hotel? *' I am most anxious to see him, 
sir," said the lady ; '* can you put me in the way 
of doing so, without the chance of his seeing 
me ? " " Nothing can be more easy, madam," 



41 



314 THE LIFE OF 

replied the landlord, somewhat surprised at such 
a demand: "at five o'clock Mr. Brummell inva- 
riably descends fix)m his room to the table d^hdte ; 
his apartment is on this very staircase, and he 
must pass yours ; I will, therefore, with your per- 
mission, rejoin you at that hour, and, when I hear 
him coming down, I will go out and meet him; 
if you then station yourself at your own door, 
you will see him distinctly, for he always has a 
Ught in his hand." True to his appointment, Mon- 
sieur Fichet met Brummell, and held him in con- 
versation for a few minutes, on the stairs, in a 
convenient position for being scrutinized ; on return- 
ing to the incognita's room, he found her in tears 
and much affected, and it was some time before she 
could thank him for his civiUty — this over, she paid 
her reckoning, and left the same evening for Paris, 
by the diligence ! 

Who was this mysterious being? Perhaps one 
of the pass^e leaders of fashion, some inexorable 
ci-devant Lady Patroness of Almack's, who had 
imposed upon herself a pilgrimage, not indeed to 
the shrine, but to the remnant, of that finished 
character who had contributed so much to the 
eclat of these exclusive reunions. Perhaps it was 

Lady J ;y, or Madame de Bagration, or perhaps 

a " chatte metamorphosde en femme ;" one was 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 315 

as likely as the other, for the afiair is involved in 
mystery. Two or three months after this occur- 
rence, the shabbiness of his dress, and the other- 
wise neglected state of his person, daily grew worse : 
it was perhaps this that made him cease to pass 
his evenings at houses where, from humane feel- 
ings, he would still have been made welcome. 

They were now spent at some obscure cafe^ near 
the Place Royale, where his yet taking manners 
enabled him to obtain, on credit, what had always 
been a great luxury to him, a cup of coflfee — that 
is, a second cup : this he could not get at the Hotel, 
one being the allowance that was contracted for in 
the agreement for his board. Sometimes the old 
woman who kept this cafi would request him to pay 
his account, when Brunmiell, looking out of the 
window, and at the sky, used to reply, **Oui, 
madame, ^ la pleine lune, ^ la pleine lune ;" and 
this, with one of his distinguished bows, (for the 
machinery was the same, though the mind was 
gone,) always satisfied her: — her bill, which was 
paid at his death, amounted to sixty francs. 

A few months after this, his memory was so 
defective, that he did not recollect what he had 
been saying for two minutes together. His friend, 
Colonel G * * "^^ '^j who called one morning to see 
how he was going on, told him that Mrs. G '^ * * * 



316 THE LIFE OF 

always made particular inquiries after him : Brum- 
mell appeared pleased at the compliment ; but, in 
a few seconds, he became totally unconscious who 
was speaking to him, and remarked, in a confi- 
dential tone, " Ah ! Mrs. G**** inquires after me, 
does she ? I saw her yesterday, and do you know, 
between ourselves, she very often pays me a visit ; 
but pray don't tell the Colonel — he is such a jea- 
lous fellow." 

It would be painful as well as tedious to detail 
all . the different stages of mental decay through 
which this unfortunate man passed, before he be- 
came hopelessly imbecile. One of the most singu- 
lar eccentricities that he exhibited was the follow- 
ing : — On certain nights some strange fancy would 
seize him, that it was necessary he should give a 
party, and he accordingly invited many of the dis- 
tinguished persons with whom he had been intimate 
in former days, though some of them were already 
numbered with the dead. 

On these gala evenings, he desired his attendant 
to arrange his apartment, set out a whist-table, 
and Ught the bougies^ (he burnt only tallow at the 
time,) and at eight o'clock this man, to whom 
he had already given his instructions, opened wide 
the door of his sitting-room, and announced the 
** Duchess of Devonshire." At the sound of her 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 317 

Grace's well-remembered name, the Beau, instantly 
rising from his chair, would advance towards the 
door, and greet the cold air from the staircase, 
as if it had been the beautiful Georgiana herself. 
If the dust of that fair creature could have stood 
reanimate in all her loveliness before him, she would 
not have thought his bow less graceful than it 
had been thirty-five years before ; for, despite poor 
Brummell's mean habiliments and uncleanly per- 
son, the supposed visitor was received with all his 
former courtly ease of manner, and the earnest- 
ness that the pleasure of such an honour might 
be supposed to excite. " Ah ! my dear Duchess," 
faltered the Beau, " how rejoiced I am to see 
you ; so very amiable of you at this short notice ! 
Pray bury yourself in this arm-chair ; do you know 
it was a gift to me from the Duchess of York, 
who was a very kind friend of mine; but, poor 
thing, you know, she is now no more." Here 
the eyes of the old man would fill with the tears 
of idiotcy, and, sinking into the fauteuil himself, 
he would sit for some time looking vacantly at 
the fire, until Lord Alvanley, Worcester, or any 
other old friend he chose to name, was announced, 
when he again rose to receive them, and went 
through a similar pantomime. At ten, his at- 



318 THE LIFE OF 

tendant announced the carriages, — ^and this farce 
was at an end. 

At length Brummell became so infirm and 
childish, that he could not safely be trusted alone. 
One evening, in crossing the street to his per- 
fumer's, he fell down, and seriously hurt himself ; 
and when he was brought into the hotel, bleeding 
and covered with mud, the waiter discovered that 
his left boot was only half drawn on. On another 
occasion, a great crash of glass was heard in the 
street, and, on some one going to his room, to 
ascertain the cause, it was found that he had fallen 
with the back of his head against the window ; 
fortunately, however, without doing himself any 
injury. These circumstances made it absolutely 
necessary that some one should be constantly with 
him ; and an old woman was engaged for the pur- 
pose ; but a nurse she could not be called, for she 
conduced little or nothing to his comfort ; and 
his person and apartment remained nearly as ne- 
glected as ever. 

Brummell, who disliked at all times the attend- 
ance of strangers, abominated this old woman, and 
though he generally treated her with politeness, he 
would sometimes revenge himself upon her for what 
he considered impertinent interference. Amongst 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 319 

other caprices, he would occasionally refuse to go to 
bed, and in the contentions that then ensued be- 
tween them, the neighbours on the opposite side of 
the street could distinctly hear him scream, " Ah ! 
est ce que vous ^tes ma maitresse ?'* — ^the discussion 
ending in her being obliged to call the waiter's bro- 
ther to her assistance. 

This man had been in the army, and was a 
much more proper person to have the care of him ; 
for, when he attempted to resist the corporal's 
authority, he always expostulated with him firmly, 
but kindly ; and in general prevailed upon him to 
submit quietly: sometimes, however, he failed to 
persuade him ; and when Brummell angrily inquired 
whether he was to be his master, he replied, *' Oui, 
je suis votre maitre, et couchez vous de suite." 
This order, given in a loud tone, was sufficient; 
and taking him gently by the arm, to which coer- 
cion the poor fellow made no remonstrance, he 
conducted him to his bed. It is much to be re- 
gretted that the young soldier could not be spared 
from his duties, as assistant waiter of the hotel, 
to accompany Brummell in a daily walk, if only 
in the garden attached to the house ; for uninter- 
rupted confinement to his apartments seriously 
impaired his general health, and gave the last and 



320 THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 

most decisive blow to his intellect. Francois, who 
had been for upwards of eighteen months in partial 
attendance on him, assured me, that he saw a 
great alteration, both in his mind and body, only 
a week after Brummell had been deprived of his 
liberty. 



CHAPTER XXV. 

Brammell's mind becomes quite impaired — Proofs of this — Destruction of 
his books — In want of a sufficient quantity of fuel — Reply to his visitors —

* * * — Preparations for placing BrummeU in the Bon Sauveur. 

In the summer of 1838 Brummeirs imbecility was 
complete, and he every day gave fresh proofs of this 
in his amusements, or rather his occupations. One 
in which he took particular pleasure was to dress 
his own wig ; and the quantity of oil that he poured 
over it was so great, that when he put it on, gene- 
rally the wrong side in front, it dropped from his 
head on to his dressing-gown in streams. At other 
times he would walk about the room bald, and 
accuse the hair-dresser of stealing his perruque, for 
he had only one ; but on a search being made in 
his bed-room it was generally discovered carefully 
hidden away between the mattresses, or some other 
very out-of-the-way place. 

When reduced to this state, he destroyed piece- 
meal valuable editions of Shakespeare and Sheri- 
dan's works, and many of the piquant letters that 

VOL. II. Y 



322 THE LIFE OF 

he had received from former friends, some of them 
being from royal personages. Billets also, breathing 
tender efinsions from the seductive pen of Lady * * *, 
and the fashionable Mrs. ***, were brought 
from the recesses in which they had for years lain 
concealed, and in some of them were enclosed and 
recorded the silken tresses and delicate distresses 
of these comets in petticoats. These relics, which 
had hitherto been hidden with jealous care and be- 
coming reverence from any other eyes than his own, 
were now rudely disturbed from their long repose, 
and to receive — what ? the tribute of a sigh or tear ? 
Alas ! no : the scrapings of a beard three days old. 
The reader will regret, as the author has done, that 
notes of Madame de Stael, Charles the Tenth, when 
Comte d'Artois, and those of many other celebrated 
characters, were subjected to this desecration, and 
thus entirely lost. Eheu! quam mutatus' must poor 
Brummell have been, when he substituted a manu- 
script of the authoress of Corinne for his shaving- 
book ! 

His chief delight at this time was to sit opposite 
a blazing fire, of which comfort he seems to have 
been sometimes in want. It has been already re- 
marked that he was always a chilly mortal, and at 
Calais, as well as in prison, liked to have a fire in 
his room, even in the height of summer ; therefore, 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 323 

now that he was old and an invalid, it may easily be 
imagined he required bon feu in the winter. The 
allowance of wood that he at one time received was 
a cotret a day, certainly not sufficient to keep np a 
good fire; and he very naturally, in his imbecile 
state, would, if he could lay hands upon it, put it all 
on at once, and bum it away in a few hours^ leaving 
himself unprovided for the rest of the day. The 
report of his being without fuel having come to 
the knowledge of the English residents, two of them 
went to the hotel to see if such was the fact : they 
found that he had a good fire, but could draw no 
remark nor explanation from him on the subject, 
and the only observation he made during the inter- 
view referred to his attendant, who was making lace 
in a corner of the room, — *'What a cursed old 
woman that is 1" 

His other gratification was to eat, which, as his 
appetite was unnatural, he did enormously, lie 
was known to have partaken of fifteen dishes one 
after the other. But the quality of his diet was 
quite immaterial. He ate meat as if it had been 
bread, apparently unconscious of there being any 
difference between them ; neither could he distin- 
guish beer from champagne. He who had, a year or 
two before, almost quarrelled for wings of chickens, 
and sent his plate indignantly away because it was 

y2 



324 THE LIFE OF 

tomata instead of some other sauce, would now 
gloat over a beef-steak floating in bad butter and 
chopped onions, or swallow the coarse fat of a pig, 
(and, be it remembered, a French pig,) with as much 
gusto as in former days he had discussed a pdt^ de 
foie gras, or snuffed the fragrance of the truffles 
which sent up their odours at Lord Sefton's table. 
The fillet of veal and Brussells sprouts, which he 
once drolly described in his youth as ** a hamper of 
greens and half a calf," would now have had more 
charms for him than one of the culinary successes 
of his noble friend^s five-hundred guinea chefy to 
perfect the flavour of which thirty hams, and thirty 
days and nights had been sacrificed — ^for it was a 
piece de resistance. His meals were now served to 
him in his own room, as the immense quantities of 
food he devoured at the table d'hdte brought on fits 
of indigestion that threatened severe illness, and his 
medical man at length gave orders that only a cer- 
tain quantity of food should be given to him. 

But though Brummell's manner of eating was 
sufiiciently unpleasant to those who sat near him, 
and the quantities he eat injurious to himiself, 
the principal reason for his being removed from 
the public table was the deplorable state of his 
person ; so disagreeable had been his presence for 
some months previously to this measure being 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 325 

adopted, that he had been placed in a corner of 
the room as far away from the other guests as 
possible. 

While he was in this state, another mysterious 
visitor arrived at the H6tel d'Angleterre ; in this 
case, the stranger was a gentleman, and his mo- 
tive in coming more of humanity than curiosity. 
He also requested, as the lady had done, to see 
him, if it was possible to do so without being seen, 
and, as there was now no chance of his recognizing 
anybody, the landlord asked the inconnu, to follow 
him up stairs to the Beau's room. On reaching 
the landing outside the door, the stranger, however, 
paused, not liking, perhaps, to trust entirely to the 
landlord's opinion of BrummelPs powers of recog- 
nition. Monsieur Fichet, therefore, entered alone, 
leaving the door open, and said, ** Bon jour, Monsieur 
Brummell ; et la sant^, 9a va bien?" " Tr^s bien, 
je vous remercie," responded his lodger, as he con- 
tinued dusting the mantel-piece and two or three 
shells that were upon it. " Avez vous entendu 
lesnouvelles?" said the landlord. **Non." "George 
Quatre est mort.*' " Ah ! est-il vrais ?" This was his 
only remark, and, as he took no farther notice 
of him, Monsieur Fichet joined the stranger, who 
had in the meantime been a careful observer of 
the interview, and said *' Well, Sir, I touched upon 



326 THE LIFE OF 

the point I thought most likely to rouse him> 
and you see that he has quite forgotten the past ; 
his head is completely gone." "He is indeed, 
sadly altered," replied the Englishman. **I can 
scarcely helieve, that I have seen George Brum- 
mell." 

The conversation, as they descended to the yard, 
still referred to his wretched condition and the 
state of his afiairs, and when it drew to a close 
the gentleman said, *'Sir, lam much obliged to 
you. I was once very intimate with Mr. Brummell ; 
should he require anything necessary to his com- 
fort that the allowance he receives cannot pur- 
chase, I shall be happy to pay for it." " But 
who am I to write to ? " said the landlord. The 
stranger hesitated for a moment, and then said, 
" A letter to Lord S * * * will always find me 
by the post," and before he left the town, he had 
an interview with Mr. Armstrong upon the subject, 
when he expressed extreme surprise at the com- 
fortless and neglected condition in which he found 
his old friend. 

Distressing, indeed, are the details of Brummell's 
last days. Six months before he left the H6tel 
d'Angleterre, and within eighteen of his death, his 
intestines became paralysed, every organ of his 
body being more or less affected, and the functions 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 327 

of it were not under the slightest control. When 
he was asked, how he could be guilty of acts too 
painful to record, he either fathered them on 
Stop, a pointer of the landlord's, or an English- 
man who had the rooms below, and who never 
came near him ; neither did any one else excepting 
from dire necessity, unless, indeed, it was the Eng- 
lish clergyman, or Mr. Armstrong's servant. His 
old associates had long ceased to call in upon him ; 
their sensibilities or their pleasures having out- 
weighed the dictates of humanity, and he was left 
entirely in the hands of menials, who had no super- 
vision to dread. There was nothing to stimulate 
them to take proper care of him, and he was at 
last utterly neglected; he existed, but every one 
had forgotten it, even in Caen. 

To poor Stop he had always been extremely 
partial : the grateful animal invariably sat between 
his feet at the table d^hdie^ and was never known 
to change his position to any other part of the 
room : if Brummell happened to be absent at the 
dinner hour, his canine friend would place him- 
self opposite to his empty chair, his head peering 
beneath the table-cloth, and his earnest gaze 
directed towards the door. No one could allure 
him from his post, no fragments would he accept 
from any hand but that of his now imbecile 



328 THE LIFE OF 

benefkctor ; he was the oaly creature that con- 
tinued to keep up any social intercourse with 
him^ and his instinct^ at this melancholy period 
of my narrative, may be said to have been superior 
to the intellect of his adopted master — for he was 
cleanly. 

The man who had once been such an extra- 
ordinary example of personal neatness and the 
''arbiter elegantiarum*' of fashionable life, and, 
who had, only three years before, hoped and beg- 
ged, that he might not die " from filthiness," was 
now approaching his end in that very condition; 
was an object, so loathsome and offensive, that 
admission into an hospital was the most desirable 
thing that could happen to him. If anything is 
wanting to complete this sketch of the wretched 
state that Brummell was at last reduced to, the 
following letter, written from Caen at this period, 
will afford the most painful illustration. 

Caen, November 28th, 1838. 

My dear Sir, 

I have deferred writing for some time, hoping to 
be able to inform you that I had succeeded in get- 
ting Mr. Brummell into one of the public institu- 
tions, but I am sorry to say that I have failed ; I 
have also tried to get him into a private house ; 



GEOROB BRUMMELL. 329 

but no one will undertake the charge of him in his 
present state : in fact> it would be totally impossible 
for me to describe the dreadful situation he is in. 
For the last two months I have been obUged to 
pay a person to be with him night and day, and 
still we cannot keep him clean ; he now lies upon a 
straw mattress, which is changed every day. They 
will not keep him at the hotel, and what to do 
I know not : I should think that some of his old 
friends in England would be able to get him into 
some hospital, where he could be taken care of 
for the rest of his days. I beg and entreat of 
you to get something done for him, for it is quite 
out of the question that he can remain where he 
is. The clergyman and physician here can bear tes- 
timony to the melancholy state of idiotcy he is in. 

Yours faithfully. 

To , Esq., street, C. ARMSTRONG. 

London. 

Poor Brummell was, and had been for the last year 
and a half, a fit subject indeed for a hospital, for 
nothing more piteous than his condition of mind and 
body, during the last year of his residence at the 
hotel, can be conceived, not only in comparative con- 
trast to his former fortunes, but in positive want of 



330 THE LIFE OP 

the necessaries of life. Though the report of his not 
having a fire at all, which occasioned the visit of 
enquiry I have mentioned, was certainly an exagge- 
ration, it is nevertheless equally certain that he had 
not fiiel enough ; for, to my own knowledge, a 
French lady, resident in the hotel, often sent wood 
to his room. It has been already stated that the 
landlord of the hotel received fifteen hundred francs 
for his board and lodging ; it will, therefore, be for 
the reader to judge, whether the remaining fifteen 
hundred of his allowance could, or could not, pro- 
vide a proper quantity of firing, and supply his 
other necessities and crazy whims ; or, whether it 
was ill-managed. For several months before he left 
the hotel, these whims could have cost nothing, as 
he was never allowed to move out of his room ; he 
could not, therefore, run up bills for marrons glaces^ 
biscuits de RheimSy or eau-de-Cologne. 

Half-a-year more, however, from the date of this 
letter dragged on, and he still remained in Jhis 
grievous condition ; his complication of diseases in- 
creasing, and insufficiently provided with everything 
but food. Though there was a person to look after 
him, the duties of such a situation were so lamenta- 
bly ill fulfilled, that it may be truly said, he was 
destitute of that careful personal attendance, the 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 331 

scrupulous niceties of which are so indispensably 
requisite to an aged invalid, especially one afflicted 
in such a peculiarly distressing manner. 

To confirm this assertion I will merely say, that 
his attendant informed me, that his linen was 
changed only once a month. Most fortunate, there- 
fore, was it for him, when the arrangements for his 
admission into the Bon Sauveur were completed, 
and that the last year of his existence was passed 
within the walls of that asylum. This institution 
is one of such magnitude and utility, so compre- 
hensive in its various objects, and so perfectly well 
conducted, that, before speaking of BrummelFs re- 
sidence there, I shall give a short description of it ; 
thinking it may possibly be read with interest by 
those who take part in the management or support 
of similar establishments in our own country.

The public charities in France are generally main- 
tained by the Government ; it must not, however, 
be supposed that there are no voluntary ones : under 
the influence of the religious orders, many have 
been brought into existence, and that of the Bon 
Sauveur may challenge comparison with any bene- 
volent institution, public or private, in England. It 
consists of a sisterhood, not cloistered, and was 
founded in 1730 by Anne le Roy, a shopkeeper's 
daughter of the town of Caen. In common, how- 
ever, with all other convents in France, useful or 
otherwise, it was suppressed in 1792, and the Nuns, 
with sixteen insane female patients, were driven 
with violence from the home in which they exer- 
cised their charitable avocations. In the month of 
October, 1804, the troubled times of the Revolu- 
tion having passed away, they purchased the house 



THB LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 333 

of the Capucins, and, in the May of the following 
year, the Sisters of Charity again met within its 
walls. But it was not till 1818, that the Bon 
Sauveur became fully developed, when Monsieur de 
Montlivault, the Pr^fet, advised, and succeeded in 
inducing, the Conseil G^n^ral of the Department 
to lend the nuns the sum of ninety thousand 
francs : the establishment was then enlarged for the 
reception of the insane, of both sexes, who had 
hitherto been confined in the central house at 
Beaulieu, and also to admit the deaf and dumb. 

Thus assisted, the nuns and their director, the 
Abb^ Jamet, proceeded to form the present asylum, 
which is situated in the suburb near the Bayeux- 
road, and, with building, gardens, and orchards, 
occupies a space of not less than fifteen acres ; 
the cider, bread, and clothing, with many other 
articles used by the inmates, are all made on the 
premises. Within the walls are several distinct 
edifices, the largest of which is occupied by the 
insane patients. These unfortunate beings are 
classed, agreeably to the character of their malady, 
each class being subdivided, according to the sum 
each of them pays to the establishment. A few 
have houses entirely to themselves, with a garden 
to walk in or cultivate ; others rent a suite of rooms, 
many only one. They are all simply, but nicely 



334 THE LIFE OF 

fiimished, and so constructed that each individual 
may be as retired as he pleases. The various duties 
of this institution are performed by seventy-five 
Soeurs de Charity, and fifty novices, with a very 
large establishment of servants ; the former, or 
servants whom they overlook, according to the sex 
of the sufferer, never quit the patient ; the number 
of attendants on each being regulated by the state 
of his mind or health. 

Valuable, indeed, must be the services of women, 
who have no interest but that of acting up to those 
precepts which their religion approves and directs ; 
and who, however highly bom, gently nurtured, or 
brilliantly educated, feel no repugnance in undertak- 
ing the most menial and disgusting offices ; — truly 
may it be said, that they illustrate their denomina- 
tion, and comply to the very letter with the injunc- 
tions which the great Author of our faith, to whom 
their lives are dedicated, laid upon all his followers. 
What man, — could he be aware that this most 
dreadful calamity of our human nature, insanity, was 
to be his lot, or that, like the unfortunate Brummell, 
with the gleams of consciousness still remaining, he 
should be doomed to close, in a second childhood, 
and in a foreign land, twenty-five years of expatria- 
tion, — who would not be thankful to think that he 
might be permitted to enjoy the blessings of this 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 335 

refuge, and the soothing care of its benevolent 
supporters? Where is the invalid who has not 
felt the comfort and happmess of having his feverish 
lips moistened; and the pillow on which he has 
tossed many long and weary nights without finding 
repose, smoothed by the hand of a wife, a mother, 
or a sister, who will for a moment hesitate to say, 
that these objects of our commiseration are made 
more happy, by the presence of the untiring and 
unselfish ScEur de Charity? And how should it 
be otherwise? Men cannot feel like self-devoted 
women ; the details of a sick room are ennuyeux to 
them; they tread heavily; the confinement becomes 
irksome ; they sleep when they should watch ; and 
the freshness and tenderness of feeling they pos- 
sessed when they entered the mad-house become 
blunted, by having so much misery constantly be- 
fore their eyes. 

The treatment pursued in this asylum is similar 
to that practised in every well-regulated one in 
England. All violent measures are completely laid 
aside, and those patients who are in a tranquil state 
are allowed to frequent the reading, billiard, and 
music rooms ; while those who are not rich, and 
therefore have not the entree to these amusements, 
work in the gardens, follow their own trades, pro- 
menade the courts, which are planted with trees, or 



336 THE LIFE OF 

play at those games to which, in their rank of 
life, they have been accustomed. There are, also, 
carriages for those to whom that exercise is con- 
sidered necessary, and every kind of bath. The 
patients who are supported by their friends, dress 
as they please ; those maintained by the charity are 
clad uniformly ; the food, however, is the same for 
all ; there is abundance without profusion, and no 
alteration is made, either in quality or quantity, 
without an order from the medical man. 

The proportion of single persons admitted into 
the Bon Sauveur as insane, is different in the 
two sexes. In 1840, there were one hundred and 
forty-seven men, one hundred and seventeen being 
single, and thirty married; and of one hundred 
and eighty-two women, one hundred and four were 
single, and seventy-eight married : the proportion 
of bachelors to married men is as four to one ; 
and the single to the married women, not quite 
two and a half to one. From the statistics of this 
institution, it may, therefore, be fairly inferred that 
marriage acts more beneficially upon men than 
women ; and the Abbe Jamet argues from it, that 
the difference may be accounted for, by there 
being less to change in the habits of a woman 
than in those of a man ; her education, and other 
strong links, binding her to a life of virtue, which 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 337 

she only continues, not commences, in the married 
state, and which often brings with it, to her, violent 
causes of excitement and anxiety. Mrs. Opie's 
pathetic tale of the Father and Daughter, if founded 
on fact, is but an exception to the rule, that grief 
affects the mind of woman more than that of man. 

The abb^ further remarks upon the same point, 
" that the difference that exists between the pro- 
portion of the insane in the two classes, married and 
single, which is in this instance so strikingly dis- 
played, arises from several causes. First, some 
are bom idiots, others are of families subject to 
hereditary madness : secondly, some, while young 
men, enter upon a dissipated course of life, which 
impoverishes the mental faculties : and lastly, a great 
number, in consequence of the conscription, marry 
late ; or dans tons ces cas, la folic ne vient pas du 
c^bat, mais le cdibat vient de la folic." This 
conclusion must have been very satisfactory to the 
amiable ecclesiastic, and no doubt contributed to 
strengthen his opinions in favour of clerical celibacy. 

The care of the insane, and the instruction of 
the deaf and dumb, are only two of the charitable 
uses to which this establishment is devoted. There 
is also a hospital for the sick and accidents, a girls' 
school for boarders, and a day school for the poor 
children in the neighbourhood. The sisters likewise

visit the sick in the town, employ themselves as 
nurses in the most dangerous epidemics, distribute 
soup, wood, &c. to the indigent and aged in the ad- 
jacent parishes, and medicine from their dispensary. 

The expenses of this noble asylum, and a gra- 
tuitous reception of a large number of patients, are 
defrayed by the private fortunes of those sisters 
who devote themselves and their worldly goods 
to this purpose, and also the sums paid by rich 
invalids for their admission: voluntary contribu- 
tions have likewise much increased the frmds. 

Before the foundation of the Bon Sauveur, there 
being no establishment appropriated to the recep- 
tion of the insane persons of the province, they were 
left to their fate, which of course varied according 
to their station in society and their means. The 
rich, and those who belonged to the middling 
classes, were taken care of by their friends ; but the 
poor either roved about the country, the wretched 
objects of derision, or were thrown into a disgusting 
ill-regulated jail at Caen, and there abandoned. In 
1783 might still be seen there the " Tour aux Foux," 
and to its damp vaults these unfortunate creatures 
were consigned, principally naked, and having 
nothing but a little straw for a bed. They were 
attached to the walls of the cells by heavy chains. 
Those who were in the upper story of the tower 



GBORGE BRUMMBLL. 339 

occasioaally let down a canvas bag, into which the 
passers by dropped fruit and pieces of bread ; and 
the few who recollect the circumstance say, that it 
was horrible to witness the avidity with which those 
on the ground-floor devoured the eatables that were 
thrown to them. When the tower was pulled down, 
to make way for the erecticm of the present Palais 
de Justice, these poor lunatics were taken to the 
jail at BeauUeu^ and it was not till the year 1820 
that they were, to the number of forty, happily 
transfenred to the Bon Sauveur. 

On that occasion the superiority of mUd measures 
over senseless and cruel violence was singularly and 
affectingly exemplified. Amongst these forty objects 
of pity was a woman of immense athletic powers, 
who had always been confined in a room with iron 
bars to the windows, and to change her straw it 
required six men to hold her down; for she had 
been exasperated until she became, poor creature, 
as savage as a beast of the forest. It was therefore 
thought impossible that she could be managed by 
the nuns, and she was brought to the Bon Sauveur 
chained hand and foot ; but directly the cart ar- 
rived in the yard the Superior stepped into it, and 
exclaimed, as if unprepared for such a sight, 
" What, a woman in chains! take them off; there 
are no slaves here ; she will in future be as free as 

z2 



340 THE LIFB OF 

I am." From this moment she was docility itself, 
and the voice of the nuns, or any one in a religious 
dress, had complete ascendancy over her. The 
delight of her companions in misfortune at the 
sudden change in their position was extreme, and 
the Superior and the chaplain never entered their 
rooms without receiving the strongest demonstra- 
tions of their aflFection and respect. In 1841 there 
were within the precincts of the Bon Sauveur one 
hundred and seventy-two nuns and novices, five 
hundred and forty-seven insane patients, and one 
hundred and sixty-two children, of w^hich one hun- 
dred and thirty were deaf and dumb : besides these 
there were domestic servants, gardeners, stable- 
men, &c., amounting in the whole to upwards of 
eleven hundred persons. The number of the in- 
sane patients has considerably augmented since that 
period. 

Within the walls of this community, charity — 
that great moral virtue of the heart, which depends 
neither on creed nor colour for its existence, and 
which the Christian, the Mahometan, or the Gheber, 
the worshipper of the Great Spirit of the prairies, 
or the worshipper of Brahma, may all agree in 
reverencing — is exercised in all its purity and force. 
And whether this virtue be practised by Sir Jem- 
setjee Jeejeebhoy or an English peer, a French 



GBORGB BRUMMELL. 341 

priest or a Russian Mujik, is immaterial^ the evi- 
dences of it in either, elicit our respect and admira- 
tion, soften our estimate of character, and, while 
clinging stedfastly to our own opinions, dispose us 
to judge leniently of the creeds and intentions of 
others. 

It was in the year 1790 that the Abb^ Jamet, the 
present venerable head of this institution, became 
chaplain to the community ; but the intellect which 
has, for fifty-three years, contributed to alleviate the 
mental sufferings of the insane, and cultivate the 
limited faculties of the deaf and dumb, is now itself 
decayed. Happy was it for his countrymen that 
his mind was spared in all its energy so long. He in 
now in his eighty-seventh year.

Into this haven of comfort poor Bnimmell 
drifted at last, and it was a sad pity for him that 
the current of his misfortunes did not set that way 
long before ; or, that more strenuous exertions were 
not made to procure him such a desirable retreat, 
as soon as it became evident that he was, mentally 
and physically, unable to take care of himself. 
When the day arrived for his departure, some fears 
were entertained that he would object to leave his 
rooms at the hotel, and every precaution was taken 
to induce him to go quietly. His landlord, a day 
or two before, invited him to take a drive on the 
Cours, to which he consented, and a day and hour 
were named. At the appointed time, therefore. 
Monsieur Fichet, accompanied by Mr. Armstrong 
and his servant, went to his apartment, having pre- 
viously had the carriage drawn up close to the door 



THE LIFE OF GEORGE BRUMMELL. 343 

of the staircase, which was immediately under the 
porte cochere. 

On entering his room, they found poor Brummell 
in his dressing-gown, seated in his easy chair, the 
Duchess's chair, near the fire-place, but without his 
wig ; this he had placed on one knee, which he had 
raised, by setting his foot on the rail of a chair that 
stood in front of him. An old pewter shaving-box 
stood on the table close to him, and into this he 
kept . dipping his brush, and working up a lather, 
which he transferred to his peruke. So intent was 
he on what he was doing, that he never observed 
the entrance of the party, but continued painting 
away; his great object apparently being to make 
every hair of the wig lie flat. *' Bon jour. Monsieur 
Brummell,'' said the landlord, desirous of withdraw- 
ing his attention from his occupation; contrary, 
however, to his usual habit, which even now was 
courteous in the extreme, he replied, without turn- 
ing his head, or ceasing to ply his brush, " Lais- 
sez-moi tranquille/' '* But I have ordered a car- 
riage for you to take a drive with me,'' continued 
the landlord ; ** you promised me that you would 
go, and the carriage is now at the door." Brum- 
mell, however, would not go, and excused him- 
self by saying that he was not well, and would 
go another day. They then praised the weather. 



344 THE LIFE OF 

and a garden that he was to see : it was the merry 
month of May, but he knew it not. Expostu- 
lation, however, and every proposition that was 
likely to tempt him to move, failed, — he went on 
lathering and painting, evidently determined not 
to budge. 

At length, finding all attempts at persuasion 
unsuccessful, Monsieur Fichet approached him, 
and snatching the wig from his knee, threw it on 
the table. This so irritated the poor fellow, that 
he ordered them to leave the room instantly, and 
threatened, if they did not, to turn them out: 
they had, therefore, no alternative left but to use 
force, and, taking him in their arms, for he 
would not walk, they carried him down the stairs. 
This rough usage turned his thoughts into another 
channel; he imagined they were taking him to 
jail, and the scene on the staircase was most dis- 
tressing. It was in vain that they tried to pacify 
him, by assuring him that he was going to a much 
better and handsomer residence: he kicked and 
fought as violently as his swollen legs and reduced 
strength would permit ; screaming and shouting at 
the very top of his voice, — *' You are taking me 
to prison — loose me, scoundrels ! I owe nothing :'* 
and then a shriek followed, that was heard at the 
end of the court ; but his resistance was, of course. 



GEOttOB fiRUMMELL. 345 

futile, and this, happily, he appeared to be aware 
of, directly he was put into the carriage, for he 
suddenly became perfectly tranquil. 

On their way across the Place Royale, they met 

Monsieur de St. M , with whom he had been 

intimate, though he had not seen him for two 
years; Brummell, however, to the utter astonish- 
ment of those who were with him, recognised him 
instantly, and, with the feeble ray of reason that 
flickered over the wreck of intellect, he showed, 
and for the last time, that the ruling passion 
even then predominated ; for he immediately drew 
away from the window, and said, " That is Mon- 
sieur de St. M ;" and, looking at his tattered 

dressing-gown, added, " I did not bow to him, for 
I am not fit to be seen in such a deshabiller as 
this." When they arrived at the gates of the Bon 
Sauveur, and the unfortunate Brummell heard the 
bolts withdrawn, he again thought that he was going 
to be incarcerated, and wept bitterly, muttering 
between his teeth, " A prison — a prison." His 
tears, indeed, fell fast, and did not cease until the 
carriage drew up in the court yard, and descending, 
he found himself surrounded by the nuns, whose 
kind and gentle manners soon dispelled his grief 
and fears. When the Superior came up, and took 
him by the hand, Brummell was quite delighted, 



346 THE LIFE OF 

and immediately after allowed one of the sisters, a 
young woman, to lead him into the house. 

Though in a reUgious habit, he at first imagined 
she was the. wife of Auguste, Mn Armstrong's 
servant; and, turning to him, for he was sup- 
porting him on the other side, he said '*n'est-ce 
pas madame?" Auguste was rather abashed at 
this remark^ but the nun smiled, while Brummell, 
totally unconscious of its absurdity, slily added, 
"Ah vous 6tes mari^! eh bien, je vous f^licite; 
car . . ." and he turned towards the nun as he spoke, 
" vous 6tes bien une jolie femme." Thus accom- 
panied he was taken to his apartments, where 
every • comfort was awaiting him, and a blazing 
fire with an arm-chair in front of it; of this, 
he immediately took possession, expressing him- 
self greatly delighted with his new quarters. 

They had formerly been occupied by the cele- 
brated Bourrienne, who had, Uke Brummell, seen 
the bon and mauvais cote of Ufe, and, Uke him, 
terminated his vicissitudes in the refuge of the Bon 
Sauveur. When Bourrienne arrived here, he oc- 
casionally had "acc^s de fureur,'* but he event- 
ually fell into a state of childishness, and was 
always writing, nobody could make out what, 
frequently without forming any distinct letters, and 
scribbling all kinds of marks. He died on the 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 347 

7th February, 1834, in the sixty-fourth year of 
his age, and without having recovered his intel- 
ligence. 

The house in which Brummell Uved, was quitb 
detached from the principal building of the 
establishment, and did not look in the least as 
if it was intended for the reception of lunatics ; 
the windows were without bars, and the garden 
in which it stood was filled with a profusion of 
roses and other flowers ; the walks were nicely 
gravelled and edged with box, and so long as his 
strength and the weather permitted, he was wheeled 
up and down them in an easy chair by the servant, 
who was in constant attendance upon him only. In 
this oasis, poor Brummell, surrounded by comforts 
that he had long been a stranger to, passed the 
remainder of his days, not however destined to be 
numerous, but which, thanks to the humane con- 
duct of the inmates of the institution, were spent 
in perfect tranquilUty. The few friends who chari- 
tably paid him an occasional visit, always found him 
sitting before'a blazing fire, and his man-servant, or 
one of the sceurs, for he was never left alone, sitting 
in the room to anticipate his every want. When 
asked by an old acquaintance, whom he did not how- 
ever recognise, whether he was comfortable ? Brum- 
mell repUed, *' Oh yes," and, turning to the nun who 



348 THE LIFE OF 

was standing by his chair, and taking her hand, he 
said, '' this excellent nurse of mine is so kind to 
me that she refuses me nothing ; I have all I wish 
to eat, and such a large fire; I never was so 
comfortable in all my life." The nuns observed, 
that he was the most docile patient that had ever 
entered the Bon Sauveur, and that nothing could 
exceed his politeness and gratitude for the atten- 
tions he received : expressions of this kind were 
always poured forth when they complied with any 
particular request: "Ah, madame, vous 6tes trop 
bonne pour moi, je suis tr^s reconnaissant." He 
scarcely ever thoroughly recognised his visitors ; but, 
when his old landlord called, he knew him immedi- 
ately, and said, " Bon jour, Fichet : table d'h6te tou- 
jours k cinq heures ? " " Oui, monsieur," he replied. 
"Tr^s bien," said Brummell, " tr^s bien; je descen- 
drai." To the last he retained a confused re- 
collection of those persons whose countenances 
had been the most familiar to him, and they would 
occasionally bring to mind the remembrance of those 
friends from whom he had, during his residence 
at Caen, received obligations and kindness. In 
this state of second childhood he remained till 
the spring of the following year, apparently per- 
fectly happy, and capable of answering questions 
relating to his wants, but wholly unconscious of 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 349 

his real position. Though one or two of his most 
intimate friends called to see him after he was placed 
in this asylum, the only visits that he received 
towards the immediate close of his life, were those 
of the English clergyman, and this gentleman, to 
whom I wrote on the subject, draws a melancholy 
picture of the state of his impaired intellect, when 
he attempted to excite in it any reflections or 
recollections of a serious nature. This point is 
one which certainly ought not to be evaded in the 
biography of any man ; yet, remembering our own 
errors and infirmities, it should be touched upon 
with benevolence and charity — ^not in the phari- 
saical spirit of, '' Stand ofi", I am holier than thou." 
The following is an extract from his letter: — 
" Mr. Brummell was in an imbecile state when I 
arrived at Caen, and remained so until his death, 
incapable of remembering any occurrence five 
minutes together ; but occasionally recalling some 
anecdote of days long since passed. Mr. Brummell 
appeared quite incapable of conversing on religious 
subjects. I failed in every attempt to lead his 
mind (if he can be said to have retained any power 
of mind) to their consideration. I never, in the 
course of my attendance upon the sick, aged, and 
dying, came in contact with so painful an ex- 
hibition of human vanity and apparent ignorarice 



350 THB LIFE OF 

and thoughtlessness^ of and respectmg a future 
state ; for I have before visited persons whose 
mental powers were equally shattered, but still it 
was possible to touch some chord connected with 
religion, to which they responded, though perhaps 
weakly and imperfectly : with him there was some 
response, when sounded on worldly subjects ; none 
on religious, — ^until a few hours before he died, when 
in reply to my repeated entreaties that he would 
try and pray, he said, ^I do try,' but he added 
something which made me doubt whether he under- 
stood me/' About a week before Mr. paid 

him this, his last visit, his debility had continuaUy 
increased ; his hour was evidently approaching fast ; 
nature was completely worn out ; and her lamp, 
which had burnt too frequently before the altars of 
folly and pleasure, was now on the eve of expiring. 
This letter of the Rev. gentleman's is but a sad and 
painful prelude to the description of his last mo- 
ments, the particulars of which I learned from 
the nun who had attended him from the time he 
entered the Bon Sauveur. " On the evening of his 
death," said that amiable woman, " about an hour 
before he expired, the debility having become ex- 
treme, I observed him assume an appearance of 
intense anxiety and fear, and he fixed his eyes upon 
me, with an expression of entreaty, raising his 



GEORGE B&UMMBLL. 351 

hands towards me, as he lay in the bed, and as 
though asking for assistance, {ayant Vair cPimplorer 
que je vienne h son secours^) but saying nothing. 
Upon this, I requested him to repeat after me 
the acte de contrition of the Roman ritual, as in 
our prayer-books. He immediately consented, 
and repeated after me in an earnest manner (tin 
air p^netre) that form of prayer. He then became 
more composed, and laid his head down on one 
side; but this tranquillity was interrupted, about 
an hour after, by his turning himself over, and 
uttering a cry, at the same time appearing to be 
in pain ; he soon, however, turned himself back, 
with his face laid on the pillow towards the wall, 
so as to be hidden from us who were on the other 
side ; — after this he never moved, dying impercep- 
tibly." It was a quarter past nine in the evening 
of the 30th of March, 1840. 

There cannot be a doubt that Brummell must, at 
some period of his life, have considered the sub- 
ject of religion : indeed his letter in the ninth chap- 
ter of this volume shows that he was neither ignorant 
of the history of the Romish and Protestant churches, 
nor insensible to the diflference between them ; but 
it is equally certain that, whatever he may have 
done in early life, he did not, when at Caen, attend 
the pubUc worship of that in which he had been 



352 THE LIFE OF 

brought up, even when consul. But though he 
never supported religion by his example, he was no 
sneering Sadducee : he never treated it with disre- 
spect, nor ridiculed the observance of its duties in 
others ; on the contrary, he always admonished his 
young associates if they showed any disposition to 
joke upon the subject. Unhappily, however, this 
furnishes no evidence that he ever felt the force or 
value of it in his Ufe so deeply as he did the want of 
it in his dying moments, when he yielded to the 
nun's persuasion, and repeated after her the prayer 
of her church. Mr. says, that to his re- 
peated exhortations that he would pray, he replied, 
*' I do try," but that he *' thought, from something 
he said afterwards, it was uncertain whether he had 
understood him or not." Let us hope, however, 
that he did understand him, and that the words he 
subsequently murmured, which seemed to cast a 
doubt upon the subject, were the expressions of a 
ruined intellect, which had already wandered from 
the subject. Let us hope too, that the overwhelm- 
ing feeling, the *' air penetre,*' was the result of a 
return of consciousness such as sometimes visits on 
their death-beds those who are afflicted as he was, — 
that under its influence he eagerly clung to the 
support the nun oflTered him, and that his prayer 
was accepted by that all-merciful God to whom it 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 353 

was addressed. It was the only tribute that, in that 
awful moment, his startled mind and " broken and 
contrite heart" could offer, being then utterly unable 
to remember a prayer according to the liturgy of 
his own church. Such was the melancholy end 
of the gay and admired George Brummell ! 

Poor Brummell's death caused very little sensa- 
tion in the town of Caen, for he had disappeared 
from its salons three years before. The EngUsh who 
had shown him kindness had long since left ; and, 
amongst all the young men who had formerly de- 
lighted in his society, and interested themselves in 
his affairs, not one attended to see his remains laid 
in their last resting-place. They repose in the 
dreary Protestant cemetery of the town, a wilder- 
ness of weeds and fennel, which grow there in rank 
luxuriance. The grave is surrounded by an iron 
railing, and on a plain slab of black marble, inserted 
in the headstone erected by his family, is this in- 
scription : —

given as the one of his death, and that inscribed

CONCLUSION. 



While feelings of compassion must necessarily 
predominate at this melancholy termination of a 
life, the morning of which was so bright and 
sunny, and the noon seemingly so cloudless, a 
calm review of the alluring career that led td^so 
long an evening of humiliation and misery, cannot 
fail to awaken, in the minds of many, reflections of 
a serious character ; not only as connected with 
the individual himself, but on the society of which 
he was the courted, brilliant, and pampered orna- 
ment. The possession of commanding talents, 
enormous wealth, or high rank, will generally en- 
sure any man a place in the fashionable world, 
and he will sometimes be allowed to indulge with 
impunity follies and caprices, nay even something 
more than follies and caprices, that, in others, 
with less cleverness or riches, or of less aristocratic 
birth, would never be tolerated ; — of this examples 
might easily be cited, were illustration necessary. 

Brummell possessed neither of the foregoing ad- 
ventitious, but powerful advantages to assist him 

2 A 2 



356 THE LIFE OF 

in establishing himself on his pinnacle of fame, 
and yet he attained it. Eager for distinction, but 
conscious that he had not the industry and perse- 
verance requisite to accomplish his purpose in any 
of the useful and honourable paths selected by 
other men, he chose an easy and amusing mode of 
arriving at his object ; and, foolishly throwing aside 
the legitiiftate connexions and means of advance- 
ment that his father had left him, he frittered away 
the abilities that attracted the attention of Lord 
Erskine, and the commendation of Crabbe, in the 
miserable ambition of being a man of pleasure, and 
the leader of a set. Eton and the Tenth introduced 
him to the highest circles ; his patrimony was suf- 
ficiently large to allow him to play the idler, and 
live on terms of intimacy with those he met there ; 
he possessed acquirement enough to encounter any 
man at a dinner-table ; and, with great powers of con- 
versation, had a most extraordinary tact in exposing 
and satirizing the foibles and gaucheries of others. 
To these qualifications must be added his great 
elegance of person and manner, the same excel- 
lent taste in dress that he had in every thing else, 
and a fund of droll and ready wit : such accom- 
plishments, with some knowledge of poetry and 
drawing, and a very creditable acquaintance with 
general literature, redeem his character from the 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 357 

popular imputation, that he was a mere creature 
of externals, a successful fop, though he laid the 
foundation of that opinion by his own humorous 
absurdities ; in short, Brummell was endowed with 
every quality that could in any way contribute to 
render him agreeable, amusing, and ornamental, 
but not one that tended, in the most remote de- 
gree, to make him useful. Had the Beau been born 
an Owenite, it is difficult to say what the commu- 
nity of Utilitarians would have done with him. 

As he turned over the pages of Ufe, he found that 
impudence, well seasoned with wit, was one of the 
stepping-stones to notoriety ; and also that a vain man, 
of whatever rank, was as easily cowed by ridicule, 
as a boy of the first form by an incipient Hercules. 
Of this discovery he took ample advantage, using it 
both as an oflFensive and defensive weapon; and, 
when he had once gained the rostrum of fashionable 
life, he kept it, and lashed most unmercifully many 
of those who, in their simplicity, had assisted in 
placing him there. He cared as little to manager 
the Prince of Wales, as he did his own valet ; and 
when discarded by his Sovereign, he took care to 
apply the blister exactly on the most sensitive point. 
But, whatever were his powers of pleasing or of ridi- 
cule, he was totally deficient in the judgment requisite 
to make the position he obtained by these means^ of 



358 



THE LIFE OF 



any solid advantage to him ; and, in spite of his 
intimacies with great people, he did not accompUsh 
either of the principal objects of a sensible man's 
life, especially in these very hard times, — he neither 
managed to marry well, nor to get a place — he did 
not even keep his own. 

Yet, up to a certain point, BnimmeU's success 
in the line he marked out for himself was complete, 
and for years he reigned absolute as the dictator of 
the fashionable section of the London world. He 
had a run : so had Mesmer, so had mustard seed. 
Dr. Graham's connubial bed, the metalUc tractors 
of Perkins, tar water, and the well known fox in 
Whittlebury forest. Like most men, however, 
whose absurd ambition is to make a great figure in 
a society which they have but slight, or perhaps no 
rational ground for entering, he fell a victim to his 
own vain and aspiring notions; for he at length 
became unable to meet the heavy calls upon his 
purse which the habits of such society entailed upon 
him, and which had never been more prodigal and 
dissipated since the voluptuous days of Charles the 
Second. This remark is particularly applicable to 
that portion of it into which Brummell was so early 
introduced — the royal circle of the Regency. 

Excessive drinking was the prevailing vice of that 
day ; and the presiding genius of the band of wits 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 359 

and epicures that graced the gorgeous halls of 
Carlton House, undermined his intellect and con- 
stitution with draughts of aromatic and luscious 
alcohol, until the judgment that had once been 
good, the generous impulses that had once been 
strong, were weakened and finally destroyed. It 
was then, when national distress was at its height, 
and tears accompanied the blessing of the poor 
man's meal, that debts, to the amount of nearly a 
million, were heedlessly contracted, and the grand 
conceptions of the great Duke of Bridgwater were 
emulated at the palace, — a canal was seen flowing 
through the centre of the royal dining-tables full of 
gold and silver fish ! 

It was indeed " the gilded not the golden age ;" 
and of those who were unfortunate enough to be 
tempted into this vortex of pleasure, there were 
few that did not eventually suffer from the extra- 
vagant ideas and dissolute habits acquired and 
fostered within its luxurious Umits. One of them, 
whose talents had graced the government that their 
Royal Patron had formed in accordance with his 
early political principles, whose sparkling wit and 
convivial powers had so often administered to his plea- 
sures, — the orator and the dramatist, — ^was doomed 
to breathe his last with the wretched prospect of 
having his eyes closed by a bailiff^: another, as we 



360 THE LIFE OF 

have seen, became a fashionable mendicant, lived 
for four-and-twenty years on the charity of his 
friends, and died in a madhouse in a foreign country. 
Many others, more or less distinguished, likewise 
finished their career in bankruptcy of health, for- 
tune, and peace of mind. But a life of pleasure 
will always bring with it its own punishment ; and 
it is scarcely possible to conceive any homily, how- 
ever powerfully written, any advice, however earn- 
estly and kindly given, so calculated to deter those 
who are entering the world from adopting a course 
of senseless dissipation, as the contemplation of the 
last days and death-beds of ^* the first gentleman 
of his age," and his intimate companions, the Mar- 
quis of H d and George Brummell. 

Towards the close of their lives, these three 
were, indeed, wretched remnants of reasoning and 
responsible beings : two of them, struck with 
paralysis, and deprived of all control over the 
ordinary functions of nature, must have been truly 
harrowing objects of contemplation, and distressing 
to other senses than that of sight; their Royal 
Friend, when stretched upon his couch of sickness, 
surrounded by a perfumed atmosphere, must also 
have felt, that corruption had seized upon his 
once elegant form before the grave was open to 
receive him ; and it is said, that when nature re- 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 361 

claimed her earth, and God his soul, he met 
the unerring reaper of the great and humble 
with the hopeless exclamation, " Is this death ? " 
The King has had his panegyrists, who have drawn 
his character in the brightest colours, none more 
so than his clerical biographer; and many of 
those who surrounded him in his latter days have 
very naturally raised their voices in his praise. 
" All the harm I wish the King," said Brummell, 
when George the Fourth was fast approaching his 
end, "is, that he would leave me but a small 
portion of the sums that the Marchioness of 

C and Sir W. K have already received." 

That Sovereign has also had his calumniators, who 
have suffered their pens to trace all the scurrilous 
invectives that mortified vanity and disappointed 
expectations could dictate — men too, who, at one 
period of their lives, were glad to accept his favours 
on his own terms. But to none of these slanderers 
or obsequious parasites must we turn for a fair 
estimate of his character ; there is a popular voice 
which speaks more truthfully than a poet laureate, 
and more generously than the literary assassin — 
he had his faults, but he had his virtues; and 
yet, it is to be feared, that voice has declared an 
unfavourable verdict. 

In the last act and deed of the Noble Marquis 



362 THE LIFE OF 

to whom I have alluded, is to be found the index 
of his life, and, if the reader should require illus- 
trations of that life, he will find them amongst 
the licentious frescoes of Pompeii, We gaze on 
the splendid efforts of Poussin*s classic pencil, re- 
presenting the fabulous scenes taken from Pagan 
lore, and fancy that the old recumbent satyr, sur- 
rounded by a group of lewd and intoxicated Bac- 
chantes, pouring over and around him from chalices 
brimfull the juice of the purple grape, are but 
the coarse brutalities of that mythology, and of 
that alone. Not so ; these scenes of heathen pro- 
fligacy are but the type of those that have been 
enacted in the nineteenth century, in the Tempio 
di Venere of one of the patrician order of this 
country; of one, who, educated in the princi- 
ples of Christianity, and having the means of 
blessing and being blessed, died without a claim 
on the genuine gratitude of his fellow creatures ; 
for who were they that surrounded the death-bed 
of this miserable mortal ? Menials, and those who 
had profited by his ill regulated passions; there 
was not one individual near him that could be 
said to have felt disinterested sorrow. Of this 
man it has been observed, " that he left the world 
without doing one really kind or generous action" 
— a dreadful epitaph. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 363 

Had Hogarth lived in these days, his burin 
would probably have handed down to posterity 
the deeds of this Charteris, this Pan of our times. 
The Shakespeare of Engravers would have deline- 
ated a " Reading of the Will," inferior, perhaps, in 
execution, but more pointed in its moral than that 
of the British Teniers. If that impure document 
had really been read in the presence of all those 
whom it concerned, the scene would have been one 
to which his bold and graphic crayon would have 
done ample justice : he would probably have placed 
us in the chamber of death, with the coffin dressed 
out in all the rich trappings of ceremonial mourn- 
ing ; we should have seen the noble relatives hearing 
with indifference the recital of those clauses which 
deprived them of wealth, won, not only in the 
hells of London and Paris, but from their needy, 
though gallant countrymen at Verdun ; he would 
have immortalized the features of " that excellent 
man" who administered to his appetites ; and round 
the man of law, he would have grouped the disap- 
pointed time-servers, and the base recipients of 
his favours. 

The prostration of the physical powers of this 
emasculated being, was the effect of excessive 
indulgence; but the bodily afflictions of Brum- 
mell, though similar, were brought on by different 



364 THE LIFE OF 

causes ; they were the result of worry, poverty, 
disappointment, and mortification, embittering the 
close of a life, the early part of which, though 
not one of uncontrolled licentiousness, had cer- 
tainly been devoted to pleasure. But, though, 
for the last two years previously to his being 
sheltered in a public hospital, he was without one 
of the thousand comforts which wealth placed at 
the command of this nobleman, and which pal- 
liated, in some degree, the details of such phy- 
sical abasement, Brummell was at least spared 
the misery of knowing what his position really 
was ; while his former friend was left to feel, not 
only that, to its fullest extent, but vexation and 
regret at the annihilation of his voluptuous plea- 
sures. Despite the possession of vast riches, high 
rank, and the glittering George, how degraded the 
life and last moments of such a man, who, sur- 
rounded by the panders and minions of his 
excesses, "dies, and makes no sign!" How im- 
measurably inferior to the life and death of the 
honest, but erring artizan, who, after struggling 
for years through "a sea of troubles," is at last 
borne down by accumulated misery and privation, 
and drowns his cares in gin. No hireling stands 
by his bedside, watching with impatience for the 
moment that shall put him in possession of a 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 365 

degrading legacy : ere his spirit leaves the world, 
and his senses are obscured for ever, his humble 
mind reverts to his Redeemer ; he may at least fix 
his glassy eye upon some object of affection ; his 
last smile is thrown upon the wife he has cherished, 
or the child for whom he has laboured, but in vain, 
and Ungers in death on his rigid features — ^the 
remembrance of this is their reward. 

The chief causes that led to the decline and 
fall of ancient Rome, were the enervated licentious- 
ness, low follies, and unbounded extravagance, of 
her emperors and patricians ; not the political and 
social vices of her citizens, though they also contri- 
buted their share of corruption. Open and unblush- 
ing depravity, Uke that of the late Duke of Queens- 
berry and the Marquis of H d, (who, inheriting 

his money, seems to have surpassed him in profli- 
gacy,) is, happily for our country, rarely seen ; but, 
towards the close of the last century, extravagance 
became one of her characteristic vices, and it has gone 
on gradually increasing up to the present time : the 
engrossing object of each class being, apparently, to 
discover how it may best ape and rival the one 
above it, independently of every one endeavouring 
to outdo his neighbour in his own. Men who once 
possessed a rent-roll equal to the annual revenues 



366 THE LIFE OF 

of half-a-dozen German principalities, are outlawed, 
or emigrate to the Continent, and live from hand 
to mouth on the wreck of their splendid fortunes, 
or the contributions of their relatives and friends. 
What was the result of a serious consultation 
with the family lawyer, previously to the recent 
breaking up of the establishment of a Noble Earl, 
at which his Countess was present — tears of repent- 
ance at their extravagance ? or a fit of hysterics, 
at the loss of her jewels and seasons in town? 
Neither — the lovely little simpleton is said to have 
run giggling from the library to the drawing- 
room, the family pictures and furniture in which 
were probably already pledged, and where some of 
her hangers-on were waiting to know the worst, 
and exclaimed, *' Well, good people, now do guess 
what there is left." No one answered, though, 
perhaps, her manner had suddenly raised their 
hopes — " Six hundred a-year.'* 

The two following anecdotes further illustrate 
the ridiculous notions of this set of fashionable 
noodles. According to the fiat of a noble outlaw, 
who long agq^ disappeared from the world, it is 
impossible to live in England, like a gentleman, 
under forty thousand pounds a-year. Having once 
had the means of acting up to such magnificent 



GEORGE BRUMMCLL. 367 

ideas, what extreme weakness to bring himself to 
a condition, so much below a just estimate of that 
character in his own eyes. 

This grandiloquent assertion is of the same stamp 
as a reply that Brummell had the credit of giving, 
and seriously, to a widow lady of fashion, who 
asked him what sum her son would require to 
enable him to dress like the rest of the world? 
" My dear Madam, with strict economy, it might 
be done for eight hundred a-year." The Quarterly 
Review observes, that these are humorously se- 
lected instances of the absurdity of extravagant 
expenditure ; " one man who spent all his wife's 
money, and lives in compulsory exile, another who 
wasted his talents in the frivolous ambition of 
being leader of the dandies, and is now deserted 
and forgotten by everybody, must, to be sure, have 
been very fine judges of what were the proper 
expenses of an English gentleman." The obser- 
vation of the reviewer, in reference to the first of 
these two celebrated characters, is perfectly just ; 
but is it not possible, nay, even probable, that 
Bnunmell, with his disposition for playing people 
off, was amusing himself at the lady's expense? 
as, previously to his leaving London, he must, for 
many years, have adorned his elegant self for much 
less. 



368 THE LIFE OF 

The extremes of affluence and destitution that 
exist at the present period are striking features 
in our social state, and they have hecome so great, 
that, if the latter remain unmitigated, the contrast 
will be too powerful not to have the eflfect of 
increasing the discontent which already prevails, 
and producing the most ruinous consequences ; not 
that the misery of the destitute is so much aggra- 
vated by the fact, that others are in the possession 
of immense riches, as it is by a thoughtless and 
vicious misuse of them, which plays upon and 
excites their feelings. Those who suflfer from the 
gnawing experience of penury do not reason ; yet 
their ill-will is not originally pointed against those 
of benevolent disposition, however exalted by rank 
or wealth ; but against those who disgrace the 
former, and use the latter without sense or charity : 
once exasperated by f Aem, they grow regardless of 
distinctions, and the just and kind of the same 
class are confounded with them, and included in 
their detestation. 

Nothing contributed so powerfully to encourage 
a wanton and silly extravagance as the influence 
and example of George the Fourth : of his reckless 
expenditure and deplorable want of taste, the Pavi- 
lion remains a melancholy and ludicrous monument, 
resembling as it does a group of teapots, candle- 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 369 

Sticks, and extinguishers ; and though the Court, in 
the succeeding and present reigns, has acted upon 
and exhibited principles and habits, in every way 
a perfect contrast to those which that Sovereign 
adopted, it can scarcely be hoped that the amiable 
and well-regulated example it now offers to the 
country, will eradicate, however it may discoun- 
tenance, the spirit of inconsiderate prodigality which 
he infiised into the upper classes of society. 

Lamentable indeed are the specimens of disgrace- 
ful folly displayed by that section of it which may 
be denominated the aristocracy of pleasure, now so 
frequently exposed in the public prints. By such 
evidence, unfortunately no idle slander, who do we 
find made the turf a by-word for infamy of the 
lowest description? Whose jockey threw himself 
off, to avoid winning a race that his master had 
backed him to lose? Who clean lads out, and 
then excuse themselves upon the plea that when 
young they were treated in a similar manner ? Who 
marks the cards ? Who becomes the stake-holder 
of the price of a woman's seduction ? Who is the 
prosecutor of his own strumpet, and by that means 
becomes the herald of his own gross tastes ? And 
who are the fashionable bill-brokers, the )&ck^% of 
eldest sons, and the willing instruments of tiissr 
vices ? Who ? Unworthy rnernlier- of tbe -ccvjeui

estate, fashionable commoners, their dependants 
and toadies, and men who, having been enabled by 
money or interest to enter the profession of arms, 
have subsequently thought fit to engraft upon it the 
dirty occupation of usurers ! 

This is perhaps the most favourable opportunity 
for contrasting Brummell and his school with the 
coarse and riotous set of his own day, and the 
vulgar and worthless portion of fashionable society 
in the present. " On my first introduction to 
Carlton House," says one of the Beau's apologists, 
the epigranmiatic Cecil, " during the favour of 
Brummell, Alvanley, and that set, there shone on 
the mill-pond a gleam of sunshine, such as Ruysdael 
or Hobbima would throw over their landscapes:" 
and he elsewhere observes, that "the Brummell 
school, if effeminate, conceited, and frivolous in their 
pursuit of pleasure, pursued it at least with less 
peril to his Majesty's lieges than the rufflers of more 
recent times. Melton, which owed its origin to 
their sportsmanship,* still attests that they were 
good riders and good fellows, though they smashed 
neither turnpike-gates nor policemen: they drank 
their claret without forcing buckets of gin down 
the throats of the swell mob; and, like certain 
insect tribes which prey upon each other, their 
victims were sought and found in their own order 

* Query. 



GEORGB BRUMMELL. 371 

of society. It is not always that the scum floating 
on the surface of every great capital is of so innoxious 
a nature : theirs was the foam of champagne, not 
the frothing of cocculus indicus.*' 

As the welfare of this nation depends as much on 
causes connected with its social state, as on those 
connected with its government or commercial pros- 
perity, it is not astonishing that the country should 
execrate the existence of such a class as Cecil de- 
scribes by the figurative phrase, " the frothing of 
cocculus indicus^^' and which has been identified by 
the notorious instances I have alluded to. The 
conduct of this set has done more to shake the 
fabric of society, and to lower and discredit the 
order to which some of them unluckily belong, than 
all the agitation and clamour of captious and con- 
ceited demagogues ; for, the fact that the possession 
of a coronet makes a man's follies or vices doubly 
mischievous, is as indisputably true as it is pre- 
eminently unjust to condemn the whole peerage 
because some individuals of it are profligate men. 
Hundreds of commoners are to be found as bad, 
but they pass unobserved in the crowd in which the 
coronet makes the peer a marked man. It should 
also be borne in mind, especially in these days when 
the love of change and innovation is so rife, and 
Magna Charta scarcely remembered, that while the 

2 b2 



372 THE LIFB OP 

nobility of other great nations have neglected to 
show and maintain a high moral feeling, and have 
impeded the progress of rational liberty, it is to the 
predecessors of ours, to the barons of old, that 
England owes the earliest recognition of her poli- 
tical and social freedom. It is to their sturdy oppo- 
sition to the encroachments of the Crown that the 
people are indebted for the liberal character of the 
constitution; and throughout the troubles or glories 
of English history, the effects of their noble conduct 
on that of their countrymen and descendants may 
be traced. We may indeed look over Europe in 
vain in search of a body of men who, taken gene- 
rally and collectively, are endowed with more 
generous sentiments, solid information, or patriotic 
feeling. Shall we find them amongst our neigh- 
bours, whose noblessey from having followed an op- 
posite course, has been reduced to a very mockery 
of rank and. aristocracy ? or shall we seek for them 
amongst the slave-owners of Russia ? In Hungary, 
or perhaps in Sweden, may be found a nobility that 
more nearly resembles that of Great Britain. 

On the character and conduct of the peerage, 
the preservation of a high tone of feeling in our 
social condition materially depends, and the main- 
tenance of the integrity of their order in the state is 
as necessary to that object as it is to the existence 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 3^3 

of the constitution : to endeavour, therefore, to 
lower their just prerogatives, or to libel them as 
a body, is not only discreditable, but insane. But 
they must uphold their own dignity, and purge 
their order of the scum, the '* frothing of cocculus 
indicus,^^ that has of late manifested itself amongst 
them : for as the notoriety consequent upon 
vicious excesses is far greater than ever attends a 
quiet and benevolent routine of Ufe, they will, if 
they neglect to do this, induce a growing contempt 
for their rank and privileges, and provide argu- 
ments by which those, who neither understand 
their usefulness, nor estimate their many virtues, 
will strenuously seek to injure them in the eyes of 
their countrymen. There are many members of this 
class who mix but little with the fashionable world, 
but the quiet utiUty and happy influence of whose 
lives and character, though unfelt and unappreci- 
ated at Almack's or Crockford's, extend far and wide 
round their own hall doors. Some there are also, 
who, while they enjoy the pleasures of that world, 
do not forget the responsibilities attached to their 
position, and who devote both time, talents, and 
energy to the public service and to the exercise of 
private benevolence ; and some there are who, like 
Brummell, miserably waste their capabilities in one 
everlasting routine of dissipation and trivialities. 



374 THE LIFE OF 

But even these should not be confounded with 
that worthless set of which I have spoken, whose 
conduct would not be tolerated by the respect- 
able of any class, and is only equalled by the 
dregs of the very lowest. In Brummell, however, 
though there was much to amuse, there was little 
to admire or to commend, and it is probable that 
many of those who chose him as an agreeable 
acquaintance, would have hesitated to accord him 
their esteem. He realized in his person all Lord 
Chesterfield's ideas of a gentleman, and his worldly 
principles and rules of life also coincided with his 
lordship's notions of that character: let us re- 
collect, however, that Brummell wore the bells of 
folly rather than the brand of vice ; that he was 
neither a drunkard, nor a sensuaUst ; and when 
comparing him with many of those who surrounded 
him, we may even find grounds for a modified 
panegyric, if such an expression be admissible. 
He had no striking virtues, and lived for the 
enjoyment of the passing hour ; yet in this respect 
he was no exception to those who constituted 
the world of fashion in his day, or do so in the 
present : there were, and are, thousands like him, 
neither better nor worse as to principles or feelings, 
but far his inferiors both in manners and tastes. 

An elderly epicure, one of his contemporaries. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 375 

in writing to a French friend, speaks of him thus : 
" Son caract^re n'avait pas d'attrait pour moi. II 
fiit toujours consid^re comme le prince des para- 
sites et des flaneurs de son temps ; il ne pouvait 
ni faire, ni conserver, de v^ritables amis parmi les 
gens de bien; et quant k moi, j'ai pen de sym- 
pathie avec les gens dont le si^ge du coeur est dans 
Vestomac^ et qui ne cultivent avec succ^s que Tart 
de diner en viUe/' This is caustic enough, and 
sufficiently droll, considering that the heart of the 
venerable critic had gravitated to the same region ; 
but it is incorrect. Though fond of associating with 
great people, Brummell was never a tuft-hunter in 
the mean sense of the word; from a very early 
period of his life he Uved with whom he pleased ; 
he could command this by his superior manners and 
agreeable qualities, and never feared losing his place 
in society by being seen to notice persons of a lower 
grade ; he knew his own powers too well for that. 
Never, until he was screwed up by the hydraulic 
press of poverty, did he lose his independence ; it was 
complete everywhere, not only amongst his titled 
friends, but also with the Prince of Wales. When a 
favourite, he was never a parasite ; and it is quite 
a mistake to suppose, that he owed his intimacy 
with the Heir-apparent to any thing approaching 
to serviUty, though certainly His Royal Highness 



376 THE LIFE OF 

was never destitute of flatterers ; nor, unfortunately 
for himself, was he very unwilling to listen to 
their adulation. "Every one, from the highest 
to the lowest," says a contemporary writer, " con- 
spired to spoil George Brummell ; and who that 
knew him well could deny that, with all his faults, 
he was the most gentlemanly and agreeable of 
companions ? Never was there a man who, during 
his career, had so much influence in society." 
No one can refuse to admit this ; and few will 
be disponed to doubt, that Brummell must have 
had some redeeming qualities, to secure the friend- 
ship of several members of the Royal family ; to 
have been admitted to the intimacy of many men 
of the highest character in the country ; and to 
have retained for so many years a hold upon their 
sympathies. 

" Amongst the present generation,'^ says the au- 
thor from whose work the preceding extract was 
taken, *' none have aspired to take his place ; not 
only from a want of talent, but because, in his day, 
it was considered necessary that a well-bred man 
should still have some little tincture of the old 
school of politeness, and that feeUng is now totally 
exploded." It is, indeed, highly improbable that a 
repetition of George Brummell will ever be seen, 
but not for the foregoing reasons only ; the frame- 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 377 

work of fashionable society is so altered since his 
day, and the difficulties of entering it are so much 
diminished, that no great meed of praise would be 
accorded to any man who should be successful in 
the same Une. But, even in the article of dress, 
it is doubtful whether he has left an equal, and the 
good taste displayed by him and his contemporaries 
is no longer seen; trowsers ruined our legs, and 
Macintosh has done pretty nearly the same thing 
for our bodies. On this point, however, one in- 
dividual has, by a foreign author, been considered 
worthy of being mentioned as his successor, and 
the reader will no doubt be as much surprised and 
amused as I was on reading the name of the person 
thus indicated: *'Le dirai-je," observes Monsieur 
Am^^ Pichot dans son Voyage Historique et 
Littdraire en Angleterre et Ecosse, when speaking of 
the world of fashion and its frivolities, " Le Due 
de Wellington lui-m6me est dans le monde le plus 
insignifiant des petits-m^itres ;" and, in alluding to 
Brummell, he afterwards remarks, *' Je ne sais aux 
mains de qui son sceptre h pass^ aujourd'hui (1823) ; 
j'ai ddja nonmid le G^n^ral de Waterloo comme un 
des pr^tendans.'* But no one appears to have been 
so anxious that justice should be done the Bean's 
memory as Cecil Danby. " Our CTand-nephews," he 
says, '' will behold m George Brummell a sreat re-

former ; a man who dared to be cleanly in the dirtiest 
of times ; a man who compelled gentlemen to quit 
the coach-box^ and assume a place in their own 
carriage ; a man who induced the ingenuous youth 
of Britain to prove their valour otherwise than by 
thrashing superannuated watchmen; a man, in 
short, who will survive for posterity as Charle- 
magne of the great empire of Clubs." Without 
waiting to discuss whether these were; or were not, 
" the dirtiest of times," it should be observed that 
combs, and hair and nail brushes, were not then 
in general and indiscriminate use amongst the 
members of the clubs in St. Jameses street ; now, 
they are not only to be found in the dressing- 
rooms of White's and Brookes's, but in those of 
every other club in London. I have not yet heard 
of tooth-brushes, but that is a matter of taste : 
Vappetit vient en mangeant. I will further remark, 
in addition to these abominations, that the con- 
sumption of ornamental wafers is enormous, and 
that thousands of her Majesty's loyal subjects 
daily spit upon their Queen's head. 

In conclusion, I leave Brummell's claim to a 
reputation for usefulness to his friend Cecil Danby ; 
but I cannot on my conscience sanction an asser- 
tion that would deprive Lord John R ^1 of the 

credit of being the " great reformer" of this century. 



GEORGE BRUMMELL. 379 

As to the Beau's immortality, I fear it will be far 
more evanescent than that of the tailor Stultz ; 
for the memory of the Baron is perpetuated in cast- 
iron, on the road from Kehl to Fribourg. The 

poodle, even, of Count d*0 y has the advantage 

of him, for he has been immortaUzed by the pencil 
of Landseer, and succeeding generations will ad- 
mire the dog, when his master is clean forgotten. 
But where, indeed, is this Antinous now ? the Park 
and Longchamps echo, " Where V where will he be 
some twenty years hence ? I sincerely hope, not like 
poor Brummell, in a Bon Sauveur ; and the vigo- 
rous and comprehensive mind, that had the courage 
morale to wear a sky-blue coat, and the tightest of 
pantaloons, going, going, gone! — ^without leaving 
one essay on the philosophy of dress, or one hro- 
chare on whiskers. Alas ! for the renown of such 
men. Lucius Verus was an emperor, or he would 
never have been remembered as a Beau ; and it is 
greatly to be dreaded, that in spite of his ardent 
admirer, Cecil, his friend and panegyrist, Mr. Tho- 
mas Eaikes, and his satirical censor, Pelham — ^in 
spite of Beppo, and the stanza in Don Juan — nay, 
in spite even of his tie — that posterity will hardly 
accord to George Bryan Brummell one line in the 
annals of history. 



APPENDIX. 



Patience is certainly one of the most valuable 
qualities of the human mind, and, when that of 
a reader has been tried by two volumes octavo, 
few persons, at any rate few authors, will feel dis- 
posed to question the validity of his claim to that 
virtue. But there is a point at which the most 
patient become impatient, and those who read these 
memoirs to the close without murmuring at their 
length, (if indeed there should be any such,) will 
in all probability, and with great justice, exclaim, 
Why am I to be tormented with an Appendix? 
How is it that my eyes are not suffered to repose 
on the two monosyllables that have supplanted the 
time honoured Finis — the end? 

My answer to these questions is — that necessity, 
which the reader will admit has no law, com- 
pelled me to adopt this course, for the materials 
of which the following chapter is composed were 
only sent to me while the last sheets of this volume 
were going through the press. Had they come into 
my possession at an earlier period, they would, it

is true, have been more acceptable ; but even now, 
though it is impossible to introduce them in those 
parts of the narrative to which they more pro- 
perly apply, I think they will not be deemed su- 
perfluous. Of the authenticity of these mysterious 
materials, (I say mysterious, because they were 
addressed to me and forwarded to the publisher 
by some person or persons imknown,) there seems 
little reason to entertain any doubt, for some of 
the anecdotes are from the pen of one of Brum- 
meirs contemporaries, who appears not a Uttle 
anxious that justice should be done to the inde- 
pendent spirit of his friend. To avoid confusion, 
I have, with some little attention to routine in the 
arrangement, formed the whole of this anonymous 
gossip into one letter ; and preserving, as nearly as 
possible, the words in which it was communicated 
to me, I now present it to the reader. My prin- 
cipal Junius commences thus : — 

Sir, I see by an advertisement in the news- 
papers, that you are about to publish some account 
of the once celebrated George Brummell. I hap- 
pened to know him well enough to be aware that 
a very false impression respecting him exists 
amongst young men of the present generation; 
and there are certain anecdotes told respecting 
him, of which very inaccurate versions are given, 



382 APPENDIX. 

I more particularly allude to those of the '' Snuff 
Box," and the " Fat Friend.'-' 

I knew Brummell at Eton ; he was in the fifth 
form, and I in the Lower school, but I well remem- 
ber his appearance — ^he had a fair, florid com- 
plexion, and a quantity of light curly hair, which 
it was the fashion in those days to wear long 
enough to hang upon the shoulders. He was a 
strong, muscular boy, with short limbs ; and I can, 
even now, distinctly recollect seeing him, with 
thick shoes and striped worsted stockings drawn 
over his knees, (quite clean and tight,) going to 
play at foot-ball — in summer he used to be on 
the river, not at cricket in the playing fields. 
The first time I saw him is thoroughly impressed 
upon my recollection. I was returning at night 
from my tutor's, who lived at a house which has 
since then been Dame Angelo's ; while coming 
along the lane I heard music, and, on clearing the 
end of the house, which was then Harrington's, 
since then Holt's, I saw three boys dressed in 
fantastic dresses, making a mock serenade imder 
the window of Miss Susan Heath, the eldest 
daughter of the Head Master. The instruments 
which thus interpreted their feeUngs for this lady 
were a hurdy-gurdy, a triangle, and a French horn, 
the last being played by Brummell mi ; who held

the other two, I do not remember, but the scene 
was so infinitely amusing, that I could never 
forget it. I did not at that time know his name, 
but I soon learnt it ; afterwards I was often fagged 
by him, and his gaiety and good-nature to lower 
boys were felt and acknowledged. 

He must have left Eton early in 1794 ; he had 
then a high nose, which was broken down by a 
kick from a horse soon after he went into the 
Tenth Dragoons, and the good looks he carried 
from Eton were greatly impaired by that unlucky 
accident. In the regiment he soon became the 
pet of the officers, and, after a time, was invited, 
as a matter of course, into whatever society the 
Prince of Wales frequented. He began life with 
about forty thousand pounds ; his father had been 
a kind of secretary to the first Earl of Liverpool, 
and the position that young Brummell won for 
himself in early life, ill accorded with that which 
he was born to, and in which many grave per- 
sons thought he should have continued. 

Lady Hester Stanhope took him to task for what 
she called his presumption, and for the airs he gave 
himself, ending with an exhortation to bear himself 
more humbly. Brummell's answer was this : " My 
dear Lady Hester, if I were to do as you advise me, 
do you think I could stand in the middle of the pit

at the opera, and beckon to Lome* on one side, and 
Villiersf on the other, and see them come to me ?" 
I also recollect bemg told by one of the leading 
fashionables of my day, that when Lady Charlotte 
Jenkinson} came out, in all the pride of youth 
and her debut, her father, Lord Liverpool, was 
told that she had danced with Mr. George Brum- 
mell ; on hearing which the old Lord, remembering 
only the situation which his father had held under 
him, and knowing nothing of his son's real position 
in society, objected to him as an unfit partner for 
his daughter, and desired that such an occurrence 
might not happen again. 

After Brummell left Eton, I saw nothing of him 
for many years : he lived with his regiment, and in 
the society of the Prince of Wales, until the rup- 
ture took place between them. I know not what 
version you have got of that important incident in 
Brummeirs life, — mine is as follows. Brummell 
had never taken pains to please Mrs. Fitzherbert, 
who persuaded the Prince that his young associate 
laughed at and spoke disrespectfully of him behind 
his back. There was at this time a celebrated 

* George William, sixth and late Duke of Argyle, already 
mentioned as one of Brummeirs companions at Belvoir, and a 
kind friend to him when living at Calais.

boxer called Big Ben ; there was also a vulgar cor- 
pulent man, who rode daily in the Park, (as the 
Prince did then, on a remarkable roan horse,) 
whose name was Benjamin something or other, and 
Bnunmell got into the habit of speaking of the 
Prince of Wales amongst his intimates as *' Our 
Ben:'* this, and other expressions of a similar 
nature, were repeated to the Prince, who was gra- 
dually set against him. 

It was, I believe, (at least such was generally re- 
ported to be the case at the clubs) shortly after this 
that Charles Ellis* invited the Prince to a party at 
Claremont : Brummell went as a matter of course, 
but the Prince met him almost at the door, and told 
him, with much tenderness of manner, that his 
presence was offensive to Mrs. Fitzherbert, and 
that the party would be destroyed if he did not 
return to London. The chaise was immediately 
turned round at the door, back to town went Brum- 
mell, and, from that moment, all intercourse with 
the Prince of Wales ceased; for when the mis- 
understanding once took place, Mrs. Fitzherbert 
and her friends rapidly effected their object, and the 
estrangement became complete on both sides. 

With this event, which, if I recollect right 
took place about the year 1804, wa« connected the

much talked-of incident of the snuff-hox. It was 
the fashion in those days to indulge in a luxury of 

snuff-boxes. I have seen at Sir George C d's 

a tray handed round the table covered with such 
boxes, to be examined and criticised. Brummell 
had also a collection chosen with his singular saga- 
city and good taste, and one of them had been seen 
and admired by the Prince, who said, *' Brummell, 
this box must be mine ; go to Gray's, and order any 
box you like in lieu of it." Brummell begged that 
it might be one with his Royal Highnesses minia- 
ture ; and the Prince, pleased and flattered at the 
suggestion, gave his assent to the request. Accord- 
ingly, the box was ordered, and Brummell took great 
pains with the pattern and form, as well as with the 
miniature and the diamonds round it. When some 
progress had been made, the portrait was shown to 
the Prince, who was charmed with it, suggested 
slight improvements and alterations, and took the 
liveliest interest in the work as it proceeded. All 
in fact was on the point of being concluded when 
the scene at Claremont took place. A day or two 
after this, Brummell thought he might as well go 
to Gray's and inquire about the box : he did so, 
and was told that special directions had been sent 
by the Prince of Wales that the box was not to be 
delivered : it never was, nor was the one returned 



APPENDIX. 387 

for which it was to have been an equivalent. It 
was this, I believe, more than any thing besides, 
which induced Brummell to bear himself with 
such unbending hostility towards the Prince of 
Wales. He felt that he had treated him unwor- 
thily, and, from this moment, he indulged himself 
by saying the bitterest things. When pressed by 
poverty, however, and, as I suppose, somewhat 
broken in spirit, he at a later period recalled the 
Prince's attention to the subject of the snuff-box. 
Colonel Cooke (who was at Eton called " Cricketer 
Cooke," afterwards known as " Kangaroo Cooke,") 
when passing through Calais saw Brummell, who 
told him the story, and requested that he would 
inform the Prince Regent that the promised box 
had never been given, and that he was now con- 
strained to recall the circumstance to his recollec- 
tion. The Regent's reply was — " Well, Master 
Kang, as for the box it is all nonsense, but I sup- 
pose the poor devil wants a hundred guineas, and 
he shall have them ;" and it was in this ungracious 
manner that the money was sent, received, and 
acknowledged.* 

I have lived long enough in the world to know 

* I have heard Brummell speak of this affair of the snuff- 
box, but never heard him say that he received the hundred 
guineas. 



388 APPENDIX. 

that it is useless to '* kick against the pricks/' to 
defend poor Brammell, and, in so doing, to assail 
the once glorious Prince of Wales ; the experi- 
ment, even in these days, is not worth hazarding ; 
but be assured, that there is nothing so true of 
George the Fourth, as what an officer of his daugh- 
ter's household once said to me ; " He hates with- 
out a cause, and never forgives." But Brummell, 
before he sunk under the pressure of poverty, 
always withstood the Prince of Wales, like a man 
whose feelings had been injured. Well do I re- 
member an instance of this, one night after the 
opera. I was standing near the stove of the lower 
waiting-room, talking to several persons, of whom 
one is now alive. The Prince of Wales, who always 
came out rather before the performance concluded, 
was also standing there, and waiting for his car- 
riage, which used to drive up what was then Market- 
lane, now the Opera Arcade. Presently, Brummell 
came out, talking eagerly to some friends, and not 
seeing the Prince or his party, he took up a position 
near the check-taker's bar. As the crowd flowed 
out, Brummell was gradually pressed backwards, 
until he was all but driven against the Regent, who 
dbtiuctly «aw hiWi but who of course would not

him on the back, when Bnimmell immediately 
turned sharply round, and saw that there was not 
much more than a foot between his nose and the 
Prince of Wales's. I watched him with intense 
curiosity, and observed that his countenance did 
not change in the slightest degree, nor did his head 
move ; they looked straight into each other's eyes ; 
the Prince evidently amazed and annoyed. Brum- 
mell, however, did not quail, or show the least 
embarrassment. He receded quite quietly, and 
backed slowly step by step, till the crowd closed 
between them, never once taking his eyes off those 
of the Prince. It is impossible to describe the 
impression made by this scene on the by-standers ; 
there was in his manner nothing insolent, nothing 
offensive ; by retiring with his face to the Regent 
he recognized his rank, but he offered no apology 
for his inadvertence, (as a mere stranger would have 
done,) no recognition as an acquaintance ; as man 
to man, his bearing was adverse and uncompro- 
mising. This was the footing on which they then 
stood, and on which they still continued to stand 
to each other, when that incident took place, which 
has been so often misrepresented, and of which I 
know i?iot what version you may have received — I 
mean when Brummell said, in the Prince's hearing, 
*' Who's your fat friend ?" 



390 APPENDIX. 

Lord Alvanley, Brummell, Henry Pierrepoint, 
and Sir Harry Mildmay, gave at the Hanover-square 
rooms a fSte, which was called the Dandies' ball. 
Alvanley was a friend of the Duke of York's ; Harry 
Mildmay young, and had never been introduced to 
the Prince ; Pierrepoint knew him slightly, and 
Brummell was at daggers-drawing with his Royal 
Highness. No invitation, therefore, was sent to the 
Prince, but the ball excited much interest and ex- 
pectation ; and to the surprise of the Amphitryons, 
a communication was received from his Royal High- 
ness, intimating his wish to be present. Nothing, 
therefore, was left, but to send him an invitation, 
which was done in due form, and in the names of 
the four spirited givers of the ball. The next 
question was, how they were to receive their guest, 
which, after some discussion, was arranged thus : — 
When the approach of the Prince was announced, 
each of the four gentlemen took, in due form, a 
candle in his hand. Pierrepoint, as knowing the 
Prince, stood nearest the door, with his wax light, 
and Mildmay, as being young and void of offence, 
opposite. Alvanley, with Brummell opposite, stood 
immediately within the other two. The Prince at 
length arrived, and, as was expected, spoke civilly 
and with recognition to Pierrepoint, and then 
turned, and spoke a few words to Mildmay; — 



APPENDIX. 391 

advancing, he addressed several sentences to Al- 
vanley, and then turned towards Brummell, looked 
at him, hut as if he did not know who he was, or 
why he was there, and without bestowing upon 
him the sUghtest symptom of recognition. It was 
then, at the very instant he passed on, that Brum- 
mell, seizing with infinite fun and readiness the 
notion that they were unknown to each other, 
said across to his friend, and aloud, for the purpose 
of being heard, '* Alvanley, who's your fat friend ?" 
Those who were in front, and saw the Prince's 
face, say that he was cut to the quick, by the 
aptness of the satire. 

That Brummell seized every opportunity that 
came in his way of teazing the Regent, may be judged 
from the following circumstance, which passed 
before my own eyes : — His Royal Highness was 
going to the Picture-Gallery in Pall-mall, and 
Brummell, who was walking with some other man 
about ten yards in front of me, was exactly oppo- 
site the door of the exhibition, as the low dark- 
red carriage stopped. Brummell evidently saw it, 
and saw who was in it, though he pretended not 
to do so, and when the two sentries presented 
arms, he, with an air of affected surprise and 
mock dignity, which was most amusing, gravely 
raised his hat, as if the salute had been to him : as 



392 APPENDIX. 

he did this he paused, turning his head very gra- 
ciously towards the sentries, and his back to the 
carriage window, which he was quite close to. I 
saw, as I passed, the Regent's angry look, but 
he said nothing. There was a time in my life 
when I used to meet Brummell very frequently 
at suppers, which then took place at White's after 
the opera : there are, however, many still living, who 
knew him more intimately than I did. He was 
not a /op, as many now think he was: he was 
better dressed than any man of his day, and we 
should all have dressed like him if we could have 
accomplished it. The tie of the neckcloth, and 
the polished surface of the boot-top, were then 
great objects of attention, and no one rivalled him 
in those attributes. 

His great power, however, was in his conver- 
sation : no one got the better of him in the banter- 
ing, humorous sort of talk which suits London 
clubs and drawing-rooms ; in this qualification he 
was certainly the strongest man of his day. I 
greatly enjoyed and delighted in his lively and odd 
turns of expression, and unexpected amusing views 
and thoughts : he was never profound, never 
learned, but always gay, and to the point : every- 
day incidents, people, and things, were the sub- 
jects best suited to his purpose. Thirty years ago. 



APPENDIX. 393 

I could have repeated numberless specimens of 
his droll turns in conversation; one only occurs 
to me at the moment : '* Come to Brighton, my 
dear fellow," he said to the present Lord Liver- 
pool, then Cecil Jenkinson, "let us be off to- 
morrow ; well eat curraiit-tart, and live in chintz 
and salt-water." This is a specimen of the ludi- 
crous manner in which he expressed the com- 
monest thoughts. The power of Brummell's con- 
versational talents, however, was amongst men ; I 
think that women distrusted and feared him ; he 
made more than one attempt to connect himself 
by marriage with some one of the great families at 
whose houses he visited; but he had no success 
in that endeavour ; and I cannot call to mind any 
particular liaison, of any kind, which marked his 
influence over women. 

Brummell's reputation, as it stands amongst 
those who did not know him, is far below that 
which his accomphshments justly entitle him to. 
In thus addressing you, I have no other motive 
but to aid in showing that he was no ordinary 
man, that he had great powers in society, and 
won his way by them. His education was defec- 
tive, and he had no steady principles ; he lived 
for himself and society, without higher or nobler

motives; Imt he was not a mere insolent puppy, 
as some imagine, &c., &c. 

To the anonymous individuals who communi- 
cated these n^moranda I beg kave to offer my best 
thanks. To my principal correspondent I teel par- 
ticularly indebted ; tor, as it is very possible that 
Brummell's character, under my delineation, may 
not be drawn with that accuracy which he, in his 
])raiseworthy zeal for his fiiend, could wish it to 
be, the insertion of his own opinions has given 
him an opportunity of correcting any unfavourable 
impressions that mine may have made. 

I will also add, (this time positively in conclu- 
sion,) that should any other of Brummell's contem- 
poraries or friends feel disposed to favour me with 
a little more gossip, they will, if of the fair sex, 
secure my everlasting admiration, and if of my 
own, a deep conviction of their good-nature. —
