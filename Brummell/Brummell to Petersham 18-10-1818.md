Calais Oct. 18. 1818

There are about half a dosen individuals existing,
who, if they didn't exchange a word of communication with
me from Year's end to Year's end, either by letter, or by
message, should still hold in the same confident estimation,
for I am well assured that, with them, silence, however
prolonged, is no serious indication of forgetfulness, or of
intentional neglect. You, my dear Petersham, are of this
number, therefore I beg You will not again impose so unnecessary
a penance upon your invention, or Your time, as to write the
excuses for having *mislaid* in your memory. A thousand
thanks for the jar of snuff which your letter promises, though
it has not as yet reached my nostril. This is of course the
fault of the Commodore, as you naturally ordered out the
Royal Yacht to convey it to me. Receive also, my
acknowledgements for your trouble in having ransacked
Colnaghi's - but it was, indeed, far from my design to impose
so heavy a charge upon your kindness as you seem lo interpret.
My request did not extend, at least, I did not mean that it
should, to any engravings after the Artists I named, of an
*expensive class*

and the purpose to which it was my wish to appropriate them will
at once explain the intended moderation of my demands. I am
*patching* a paravant, or in vulgar English, a folding screen,
and as the materials requisite for its accomplishment are
scarce (that is to say of good taste) in this Graveyard of a
place, I mustered up sufficient *courage* to enlist your good
officer in furthering the undertaking — The compositions, then,
You mention, in mezzotints for Concerts &c (provided they
are in *colours*, or *brown tint*) seem like precisely suitable
to my object, and I shall be greatly indebted to you to purvey
me as many as Colnaghi, or Molteno will *liberally* dispose
of, *ceil a' dire*, without asking You for payment - and any other
scraps of Allegories or *romping* Cupids, in Medallions,
vignettes, &c &c flowers too, and butterflies (forgive me!)
*as large as life in Colours*, would be most acceptable - "These
presents" — I would humbly beg you to transmit - to me forthwith,

manner of conveying prints, and as something of larger dimensions

way of covering [party] for the light troops. I should be more than
obliged to you for the following engraved portraits (always with
the proviso, that Clanaghi does not insult you with one word about
reimbursement) the largest sized whole lengths of Nelson and 
Wellington after Hoppner - half lengths of Lord Ellen in mezzo.
after I know not whom - the best likeness of the Q. Charlotte - 
*any but Hayter's* - and the small whole length of the Regent
after Cosway - the latter, I believe, is rather scarce from the time 
it has existed, having been executed in His R. Hs. youth, some
thirty and seven years ago (don't tell him) - you will know what
I mean, it is in a Vandyke costume - these requested resemblances
are destined to embellish the walls of my cell - I have
thought but little of poetry lately - My Album has, however,
been reopened at your desire, and I have scribbled you as much
as can conveniently be composed within the scanty limits of
a letter - I will from time to time indite You transcripts from
the same miscellany. During the last eighteen months, I have
been almost constantly occupied in writing a sort of history
of my own times, confining myself to private life, and to the
exclusion, as much as possible, of political matter - it will be
ready for publication early in the winter - You may presume,
I have not

inclined to the flattering side of representation in the many
portraits that form My Cabinet - the majesty of my former *dear*
*friends*, and all the Town once affected to be my dear friends,
that is, as long as the Sun Shown upon me, may wince and cry
Shame upon me at their unreserved depiction and exposure
they are welcome - I have not written to please their palates,
but to provide for my own. I have recorded nothing but the truth
in my depictions, and if the cap chafes their temples, let
them remember their own desertion and abuse of me the moment
misfortune had compelled me to seek refuge in another country.
Of *one personage* who professed to be my earliest friend and patron.
I have endeavoured to speak with as much becoming deference to
his *public situation* as candour and the nature of my [review]
would allow; still, perhaps, with what may be considered too
much severity, because too explicitly - my object has been to 
particularise *ad [ociaw]*, not to shade too darkly, nor to employ
false lights from imagination - I never intentionally offended *him*,
though I was sacrificed to the envious whispers of those about him,
I have depicted what has come immediately under my own cognizance
and forth it will go to the world with all its own faults as well as those
of others upon its shoulders for I cannot *[starve]* from a [punctilious]
principle of unrequited feeling even towards the *highest* among
the "Lord's Anointed". You need to make this a secret -

### Chapter 5 The Artistic Trade and Networks of the Italian Community in London Around 1800
Partnerships linked to printmaking constituted a solid background for the development of London’s art market and for the mobility of the Italian community. It was indeed during these years that Italian-born Paul Colnaghi (1751–1833) founded his business, initiating one of the most important art enterprises that England had ever known. In 1785 Colnaghi joined the print shop of Anthony Torre after a brief sojourn in the Paris branch of Torre’s shop.[27] Following the boom of the demand for prints, Torre’s shop grew considerably, and when he went back to Milan in 1788, Colnaghi became responsible for the art gallery. Colnaghi soon entered into a partnership with fellow Italian emigrants. First, he associated with Anthony Molteno (fl. 1784–1845), who had moved from Milan. The company, Molteno, Colnaghi & Co., was thus created in London, while the Paris branch prospered from Torre’s activities thanks to a collaboration with other Italian-born art dealers, such as Sebastiano Tessari and Joseph Zanna.[28] Tessari and Zanna’s businesses were established in Augsburg and Brussels, respectively. This international connection provided the company with an important European counterpart. In 1793 Molteno left the partnership to pursue his own career as an art dealer and Colnaghi solicited other Italian expatriate artists, such as Luigi Schiavonetti and Gaetano Testolini (1760–1818), to join the gallery.[29]
