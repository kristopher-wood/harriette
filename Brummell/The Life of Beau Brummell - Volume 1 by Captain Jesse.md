## PREFACE 

TO THE NEW EDITION. 

"THE Life of George Brummell, commonly called Beau Brummell," by the late Captain Jesse, has been a scarce book for a long time. It is now reprinted, and a large quantity of new matter has been introduced, which had been collected by the author, but which it was not deemed prudent or delicate to insert in former editions. Many notes have also been added.

as well as forty illustrations, after Dighton and others, of contemporaries of Brummell — a man who, without birth, rank, fortune, or great intelligence, established himself as the arbiter elegantiarum among a proud and exclusive aristocracy, and whose latter career was too pitiable even for comment. 

The Editor of this new edition has to thank the son of the late Captain Jesse for the use of his father's interleaved copy of the first edition, and also for his suggestions and supervision of the proof sheets. 

September, 1885.

PROTECTED by the example of the amiable author of "The Deserted Village," who did not consider the biography of Beau Nash too trifling a subject for his pen, and encouraged by some little success in a former attempt at authorship, I venture to take another shot at that target which still continues to be the object of my ambition — the approbation of those who read. The desire to 


### Page x

please is not, however, always attended with success, for the very simple reason, that it is impossible to please everybody; and those who expect to find in the Life of George Brummell a delightful dish of scandal, will, no doubt, exclaim, "His shot has gone very wide of the mark!" I could, it is true, have served up one so hot, that it would have shrivelled up the ears of the most inveterate lovers of it; but, to repeat the anecdotes I have heard the Beau relate, of the orgies of Carlton House, of tippling Dowagers, doating Ex-chancellors, shy Generals, and borrowed

Jewels,[1] &c., &c., forms no part of my intention; and, even if it were desirable that Brummell's gossip on such subjects should be repeated, it would be impossible 

---
[1] It was reported that a lady of high rank, whose name Brummell mentioned to me, requested a certain noble duke, with whom she was very intimately acquainted, to lend her the family diamonds, either to wear at Court or at some grand ball of the day. His Grace could, of course, refuse her nothing; he immediately acceded to her wishes, and gave her an order on his jeweller for them, imagining, no doubt, that his fair friend would return them to his tradesman when the occasion for which they were borrowed had passed over. The duke, however, reckoned too much upon her honesty, for after his death, which took place a few months later, his brother, who succeeded to the title, found on applying to the family jeweller that Lady had never returned the diamonds into his custody, nor were they, according to the on dit, ever recovered. 

About the year 1842, it was also hinted about in society that a certain noble countess had borrowed some jewels from a lady of high rank — her intimate friend — without the latter's permission or knowledge, but in this case the missing articles were restored.

to vouch for its authenticity; for no one so delighted in mystifying and hoaxing people as he did, or could so readily find imaginary, and very plausible, proofs, when the truth of his fictions was assailed. 

That he wrote some detached papers in the shape of reminiscences, there can be no doubt: many passages in his letters prove this. In the centre of his diminutive garden, under the ramparts at Calais, which he frequented a good deal during the summer months, there was a small pavilion; and here, when the heat obliged him 

### Page xiii 

to lay aside his hoe or rake, he amused himself with his pen. The commonplace book in which he inserted these memoranda was secured by a lock, and one of his great friends, who, in his way through Calais, occasionally spent a portion of the day with him in his retreat, informed me, that Brummell once drew his attention to the manuscript — calling it, "his book of life," and saying, as he turned carelessly over the leaves, "Here is a chapter on Carlton House; here one on Mrs. Fitzherbert and the Prince; this is devoted to Lady H ," &c. 


### Page xiv

This book was in his possession at Caen, and, as it lay on his table, he sometimes pointed it out to his visitors, remarking, that it contained recollections of his own life, and descriptions of the gay world he had formerly lived in. Indeed, it appeared almost as if he kept a diary, for, dining one day at Mr. Villiers's, he said to the lady of the house, "Mrs. Villiers, I was looking at my journal yesterday, and I see, that it was on this very day two years that I had the pleasure of making your acquaintance." These, and many other reasons, render it more than pro-

bable that Brummell not only recorded the events of his past life, but also of each day, or perhaps week. Nothing, however, has been heard of these papers since his death; perhaps they were destroyed by him when imbecility had set the seal of unconsciousness upon his actions, or he may have delivered them up, for a pecuniary consideration, to those who were most interested in obtaining possession of them. It is, however, a highly honourable trait in his character, that he did not, amidst all his troubles and difficulties, publish them for his 

### Page xvi

own benefit. When in jail at Caen for debt, he said to Monsieur Godefroi, one of his fellow prisoners, "I have letters of the Royal family, of Lord Byron, and others, the sale of which would produce me more than sufficient to pay my debts; but I will not part with them, for I should compromise several families." Mr. Leleux, his landlord at Calais, also informed me, that a London publisher had offered his lodger a thousand pounds if he would give up his memoirs. "When this proposition was made to Mr. Brummell," said Mr. Leleux, "he was 


### Page xvii 

in great distress, and I frequently asked him why he did not accept it? To this he usually made some frivolous excuse; but on one occasion, when pressed hard for his real reason, he said, * I promised the Duchess of York that I would not publish any notes of mine during the lifetime of George the Fourth or his brothers; and I am under so, many obligations to her, and have such a deep respect for her generous and amiable conduct to me in our early friendship, and since, that I would rather go to jail than forfeit my word. She is the only link that binds me in this

matter.' At Brummell's death several packets of letters, tied up with different coloured ribbons, 
and carefully numbered, a miniature, a silver shaving-dish, a gold ring, and a few silver spoons, were found in a trunk at the hotel. The miniature and letters were taken possession of by the viceconsul, and the remaining effects by the landlord, in liquidation of an account which had only been partially cancelled. This person said, that in the same parcel with the letters was another containing a great many locks of hair. They were each of them in a separate 

### Page xix 

envelope, and, on the outside of one, in Brummell's handwriting, was the following remark: — " Lady W---, la femme la plus coquette du monde." From the foregoing remarks, therefore, the reader will understand that, with the exception of his letters, and the poetry taken from his album, I was not assisted in the compilation of this memoir by any papers left by Brummell, nor by any obtained from his family (to whom I applied), for they had none to give me, but by information which I collected from various sources. Amongst the numerous attempts that have 

### Page xx

been made in the novels of the day to delineate Brummell's character, Trebeck, in Granby, was the only one that he considered successful. I once heard him say, 'Lister must have known those who were intimate with me.' from this clever and entertaining book I have made one or two extracts. The principal portion of the materials, however, from which the sketch of his early career has been drawn, was procured from friends who were intimate with him. The description of the last years of his life is the result of my own observations, and that of 

### Page xxi 

those who were constantly about him. To them, and to those noblemen and gentlemen who were kind enough to reply to my inquiries, I beg to return my acknowledgments; and in conclusion I have merely to add, that whatever imperfections the work may have, whether as to the choice of subject, the style, or execution, I have carefully refrained from any attempt to enliven it by the introduction of anecdotes, which, though witty and amusing, would have wounded the feelings of others. In this, at least, I trust I have not failed.

THOSE who yet remain of his generation, but who were not acquainted with the subject of these memoirs, will, no doubt, be astonished that any one should have taken the trouble to be his biographer, and much wonder what there can possibly be to say about Beau Brummell — unless, indeed, it were to give the impertinent witticisms currently reported of him. But of those contemporaries who knew him intimately and still survive, few will be surprised that I have found some amusement in collecting the scattered reminiscences of so singular a character. 

### Page 2
The term Beau is now very nearly obsolete, and Brummell, to whom the term in its popular sense was erroneously applied, will, in all probability, be one of the last persons distinguished by that sobriquet; but, before entering upon this memoir, perhaps a few words respecting the most notorious of the species so denominated may not be out of place. From the earliest ages there have always been individuals vain enough to be completely absorbed in the study of dress, yet this can hardly be matter of astonishment, for every one must allow that vanity in the abstract is coeval with humanity; and it was, possibly, under this conviction that even Milton suffered himself to accuse Eve of contemplating her beautiful form in the looking-glass of Nature.

That day I oft remember, when from sleep 
I first awaked, and found myself reposed 
Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where 
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. 
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound 
Of waters issued from a cave, and spread 
Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved 
Pure as th' expanse of Heaven; I thither went 
With inexperienced thought, and laid me down 
On the green bank, to look into the clear 
Smooth lake, that to me seem'd another sky. 
As I went down to look, just opposite, 
A shape within the wat'ry gleam appear'd 
Bending to look on me: I started back, 
It started back; but pleased I soon return'd, 
Pleased it return'd as soon with answering looks 


### Page 3 

Of sympathy and love: there I had fix'd 
Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire, 
Had not, &c. &c. 

~ Paradise Lost, book iv. 

Distinctions in dress, it may be inferred, were at a very remote period highly prized, or the venerable patriarch Jacob would not, in the indulgence of his parental vanity, have selected "a coat of many colours," as the most gratifying gift he could bestow upon his youngest and favourite son; a gift which was probably valued by Joseph, not only as a proof of his father's affection for him, but also on account of its being a garment of peculiar beauty, and superior to those worn by his brethren. The hope expressed by Sisera's mother, that her son would find amongst the spoil of Barak's camp "a prey of divers colours of needlework on both sides," has also been adduced as an evidence that the princes and great men of Israel were fond of arraying themselves in glorious apparel, and far from indifferent to the decoration of their persons. 

Of the toilette of the Hebrew beau or belle, however, few details have been preserved; but no such blank exists in the history of the last conquerors of their nation; of their dandyism many and amusing particulars have been handed down to us in those works which treat of their domestic manners, after riches and luxury had increased in Rome, and corruption had stamped the character of her citizens with effeminacy and voluptuousness. 


### Page 4

The tunic of the Roman exquisite was often of green silk; he painted, rouged, and curled his hair, wore a great number and variety of rings, light or heavy, according to the season; and the most superlatively finished fops had the hairs, even of their legs, plucked out by the roots with small tweezers, called volsellii. In this state of things, it was very natural that the dress of the women, which had been, till then, modest and simple, should become the chief object of their attention; and so completely was this the case, that a lady's toilette and ornaments were called her world, mundus muliebris. 

But a refined state of society, however it may excite personal vanity, is certainly not necessary to its development: it is exhibited by the savage, in the taste he displays in the choice of his beads, shells, and feathers, and the variety and elegance shown in the designs of his tattooing; and it is highly probable, that when Julius Caesar landed in Britain, he found some of our native princes much better painted than others, and their blue tints of a brighter hue. Perhaps the iron age of chivalry, when women's hearts were won in coats of mail, not in silk tunics, was more free from dandyism than any other. In the days of the Crusades men thought but little of themselves, and, excepting in the splendour of their armour, and a gay plume or scarf, still less of their outsides. The gallant Hotspur's indignant description of the finical fop, "who shone so bright and smelt so sweet, and talked so like a waiting gentle- 

### Page 5 

woman," is one of the earliest, best, and most entertaining given in our language. In the reign of Elizabeth, the distinguished men whom her vigorous mind induced her to select for her companions and advisers, were remarkable for the bravery of their attire, for they were obliged to fall in with the taste of their imperious mistress, who devoted much time to the adornment of her person: it was, however, reserved for the court of that luxurious monarch, Louis the Fourteenth, who never permitted even his own valet to see him without his full-bottomed wig, to give effect to that spirit of coxcombality, which was introduced into England at the Restoration, by the rakish and rollicking cavaliers who formed the unprincipled suite of Charles the Second. His reign produced a host of beaux, at which time the term appears to have been first used, and amongst others was applied more particularly to Hewitt, Wilson, and Fielding. 

The first of these worthies, Sir George Hewitt, afterwards an Irish Viscount, which peerage seems to have died with him, had the credit of being the individual from whom " gentle George Etheredge,"though himself the involuntary original, is said to have drawn the character of Sir Fopling Flutter, in the "Man of Mode" — the prototype of all the fops in comedy. The Viscount appears, also, to have been one of the first persons who reduced the robuster "damn me" of the preceding age to the modern "dammee;" since become the consumptive "demmee" of our own. In Sir Walter Scott's 


### Page 6

edition of Dryden, we have, in Rochester's farewell, an example of this mincing innovation of Beau Hewitt's :— 

Had it not better been than thus to roam, 
To stay, and tie the cravat-string at home; 
To strut, look big, shake pantaloon, and swear, 
With Hewitt, "Damme, there's no action here?" 

Wilson, too, another Beau of that day, is described by Grainger as a most mysterious person. He was the younger son of a respectable family, and entered the army, from which, after a short service in Flanders, he was dismissed for cowardice, when he returned to England with forty shillings, borrowed from a friend. Here, to the astonishment of every one, he in a short time appeared the brightest star in the hemisphere of fashion; his dress, table, equipages, and stud, being perfect, and his hospitality profuse. As he seldom played, and was not known to have any intrigues, it soon became matter of lively speculation, how he contrived to support all this state; many of his friends tried to worm out his secret, but without success; for, though his conduct and conversation were apparently perfectly open, he was in reality so guarded even in his convivial moments, that no expression ever escaped him that could give a clue to the source of his wealth. Some said that he possessed the grand secret of converting meaner metals into gold, and others that he had robbed a Dutch mail of a package of rough diamonds. But a more natural solution of 


### Page 7 

the mystery attached to Mr. Wilson's proceedings, is given in some intercepted letters appended to a work published in 1708, entitled "Memoirs of the Court of England, in the Reign of Charles the Second;" and which seems to have been much read at the time, for it went through several editions. In one of these epistles, it is stated that Beau Wilson's ability to pursue his extravagant career was owing to the liberality of the beautiful Duchess of Cleveland, with whom he intrigued; but the details of the story are so singular and minute, that the authenticity of some of them may fairly be doubted. Mr. Wilson was killed in a duel by that Prince of schemers, Mississippi Law, who it is said ran him through the body before he could draw his sword in his own defence. 

Beau Fielding, who stands on record as the best-looking of the beaux, and is mentioned by Swift, as one of those "who made mean figures upon some remarkable occasions," was of a good family in Warwickshire. Being intended for the bar, he was sent to London early in life, but, giving way to the temptations of fashionable vices, soon abandoned that profession. His person was exceedingly beautiful, and he took infinite pains to set it off. Charles the Second was so struck with his figure when he first saw him at court, that he called him the "handsome Fielding." From that moment, he became the most conceited of all fops, and was not only vain and expensive in his own dress, but fantastical in that of his lacqueys, who

usually wore yellow liveries, with black sashes, and black feathers in their hats. His courage was of the same quality as that of his contemporary, Mr. Wilson, his greatest piece of heroism having been to run a helpless linkboy through the body in St. Martin's Lane. One evening, however, in pushing fonvard, to show off his dress and figure, at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, he trod upon the foot of a lawyer named Fullwood, who thereupon instantly challenged, and wounded him, but who, singularly enough, was killed in a duel with a Captain Cusack the same night. Fielding also received a severe caning from, and was subsequently wounded by, a Welsh gentleman of the name of Price. His excesses and extravagance at length consumed his patrimony, after which, he subsisted upon his gallantries and the supplies that he obtained at the gaming table, where he was generally successful. To repair his shattered fortunes he eventually married a connexion of Dean Swift's, the only daughter and heiress of Lord Carlingford. By this lady, a zealous Roman Catholic, he was converted to her faith, and probably induced to attach himself to the cause of James the Second, for whose service he raised a regiment in his own county, and whom he afterwards accompanied to France, where he lived handsomely on his wife's remittances. 

When this lady died, being again in difficulties, Fielding once more had recourse to matrimony for a subsistence, but this time he was completely taken in by a certain Mary Wadsworth, who had assumed the 

### Page 9 

name and character of Madame Delaune,[1] a person of great wealth. Discovering the fraud he soon forsook her, and subsequently espoused, when in her sixtyfirst year, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, the reputed mistress of his predecessor, whom he treated with insolence and brutality. This occasioned a prosecution, and on the 4th of December, 1706, a year after this marriage, he was tried and found guilty of bigamy at the Old Bailey; but, when sentence was passed upon him that he should be burnt in the hand, he craved the benefit of clergy, produced the Queen's warrant for suspending execution, and was admitted to bail. After this he became reconciled to his false Mary, and styles her, in his will, his dear and loving wife. Beau Fielding was the Orlando of the Tatler, and died of a fever at his house in Scotland Yard, in 1712, at the age of sixty-one. 

The next on the list is a member of that family which, through the talents of both father and daughter, has become so distinguished in this century — Beau Edgeworth. It is to him that Steele, also fond of dress in his younger days, and called a coxcomb by his libellers, alludes, in the two-hundred and forty-sixth number of the Tatler, as, "a very handsome well-shaped youth, that frequents the coffee-houses about Charing-Cross, and ties a very pretty ribbon, with a cross of jewels, to his breast : " in a note to Goldney's edition he is called the " prince of puppies." Colonel 

[1] Sir John Suckling speaks of Van Dyck being paid £80 "for copying a Mrs. Delanae's picture." 

### Page 10

Ambrose Edgeworth died in the Bridewell of Dublin, having been out of his mind some time previously to his death. 

Beau Nash, who was usually styled the "King of Bath," follows next. "His prosperity," says Butler, in his Chronological Exercises, "was of long duration; and if a man who supported himself by gambling and intrigues can be said to deserve prosperity, it was justly due to this celebrated character; but at length age and infirmities approached; and though Horace says, we should preserve consistency to the last, it appeared ridiculous to see grey hairs and decrepitude aping the gaiety and hilarity of youth." 

His Life has been written by no less eminent a hand than that of Dr. Goldsmith, whilst his tailors' bills have been printed by Mr. Prior, and his dress and appearance have been described in Boswell's biography of Dr. Johnson. Nash could be very rude at times, even to ladies, and as master of the ceremonies took a great deal of trouble to bring his code of dancing discipline and ball-room order to perfection. His picture was to be seen at full length in the ball-room of the Bath Assembly Rooms, between the busts of Sir Isaac Newton and Pope. The witty Lord Chesterfield wrote the follow- ing epigram on it : — 

Immortal Newton never spoke 

More truth than here you'll find; 
Nor Pope himself ne'er penned a joke, 
More cruel on mankind. 
Beau Nash.

### Page 11

The picture placed the busts between, 
Gives Satire all her strength; 
Wisdom and Wit are little seen, 
But Folly atjull length. 

Beau Nash was buried in the Abbey Church at Bath, on the 3rd February, 1761, having lived to the great age of eighty-eight : his funeral obsequies were conducted with much parade and solemnity, and at the expense of the corporation. 

There were, no doubt, during this period, many other eminent fops besides these; but it is observable, that, a man was never distinguished by the title of Beau, if he had anything in him superior to it; that is, assuming that the epithet means a fop, which, in the words of Roscommon, is, " a man of small understanding and much ostentation." Still, and inconsistent as it may appear, very superior and clever men have bestowed far more than necessary attention upon their dress. Petrarch, in writing to his brother, says, " Recollect the time when we wore white habits, on which the least spot, or a plait ill-placed, would have been a subject of grief, and when our shoes were so tight, that we suffered martyrdom." Lord Byron avows that he had " a touch of dandyism in his minority," and " had retained enough of it to conciliate the great ones, at four-and-twenty." The Abbe Delille, who, besides being a priest, was also a poet, and, perhaps, the ugliest man of his day, lost so little of his personal vanity, that even in mature age, he invariably had his hair dressed with powder couleur 

### Page 12

de rose; and Prince Kaunitz, who wore satin stays, passed a portion of every morning in walking up and down a room in which four valets puffed a cloud of scented powder, but each of a different colour, in order that it might fall and amalgamate into the exact nuance that best suited their master's taste. " Us etaient," observes a French writer, " des de'vots a l'elegance, et en cela ils meritent nos respects; mais e'taient-ils eld-gants? Voila la question." Upon Rafaelle, the most spiritual of painters, has the epithet, " coxcomb," been irreverently bestowed. Nelson, who wrote the Companion to the Fasts and Festivals, and who is sup- posed to have been the author of The Whole Duty of Man, was a splendid dresser : it was from him that Richardson drew his character of Sir Charles Grandison. Charles Fox also, who, late in life, was one of the most unostentatious, not to say slovenly, men about town, was a macaroni in his youth, and, with his friends Lords Carlisle and Essex, wore red-heeled shoes ! At this period the coxcombality of dress was necessarily great, for muffs, velvets, ruffles, gold lace, and perfumed powder, were then the usual appendages of male attire. We might, and with reason, imagine it was a woman, and not the Earl of March, a great sporting character, who, writing to George Selwyn, at Paris, in 1766, says, "The muff you sent me, by the Duke of Richmond, I liked prodigiously, vastly better than if it had been tigre", or of any glaring colour — several are now making after it :" and again, in 1776, he remarks, " pray bring me two or three bottles of 


### Page 13 

perfume to put amongst powder, and some patterns for velvets that are new and pretty." But perhaps the most remarkable instance that can be cited in proof of the fact that a feeling of dandyism sometimes forms a component part of a great mind, is that of the late Marquis Wellesley; to whom, almost to the last moment of his life, and when still in the full possession of those vigorous and intellectual faculties, the evidence of which forms one of the most brilliant historical pictures in the public annals of this and the latter part of the last century, — a piece of rich waist-coating was as much an object of attraction and delight as to his handsome and youthful secretary. Indeed it is said that this nobleman frequently sat alone en grande toilette, decorated with his blue ribbon and the garter, as if intending to appear at a royal levee, or a chapter of the order. But to return to the period at which the macaronies flourished (who, according to the testimony of Horace Walpole, were travelled young men who wore long curls and spying-glasses), the adoption of broad cloth made sad havoc with the tastes of such men as the Duke of Queensberry; and the beaux who came in when muffs and velvets went out, were of a very different description. One of the most notorious was the late Lord Harewood, called, from the singular penchant he had for imitating the Prince of Wales in his dress, Prince Lascelles. Of this mania he was cured by Fox, Sheridan, and Wyndham, who persuaded His Royal Highness to allow his queue (which it was then the fashion to wear) to be concealed 

### Page 14

by the collar of his coat. He readily consented, and during dinner, for they were all dining with the Prince, one of the three called Lascelles's attention to the fact, who, completely tricked into the idea that the queue was cut off, appeared the next day, to the amusement of the conspirators, without his own. Colonel Montgomery, also a friend of the Prince of Wales's, and the unsuccessful principal in the duel with Captain Macnamara, was in the habit of dressing like the Duke of Hamilton, and thus received the sobriquet of the Duke of Hamilton's double. Another fop of this century was a Colonel Matthews, who being extremely distressed at the loss of one of his front teeth, determined upon having it replaced by one drawn from another person's jaw, trusting perhaps to that jargon of the doctors called " healing by second intention." He was fitted accordingly, but, horrible to relate, the saliva, or something adhering to the tooth, inoculating the system, brought on a cancer in the mouth, of which he died. 

Though many others might be enumerated besides those I have mentioned, I will close the list with the name of the venerable patriarch of the Beaux, Sir Lumley Skeffington, who was still alive when these volumes first appeared, and was some connection of the Massareene family. He is said to have been entitled to the enviable denomination of the most amiable of the genus beau; and a distinguished author, who allowed his pen to dwell briefly on these matters some years ago, says, " that under all his double-breasted 

### Page 15 

coats and waistcoats he never had any other than a single-hearted soul." 

Having brought this sketch of the principal Beaux upon record to a close, I will now enter upon the life of him who Lord Byron said was one of the three great men of the nineteenth century, placing himself third, Napoleon second, and Brummell first. To this postulate it is not my intention to offer any support; but I think there is sufficient evidence to show that he ought not to be classed with the Beaux, if, as I have before remarked, a beau is a fop, and a fop a man of small understanding. But if I prove my own assertion, what then? Does it at all signify whether his reputation remains as it is or not? No. Then "Le jeu, vaut-il la chandelle?" Yes, if the first portion of this biography amuses the reader, and the last pages excite reflection. Some indeed will smile at the moral Brummell's life conveys: others may perhaps agree with me in the views I have taken of it.

BRUMMELL'S origin, like that of many greater men than himself, was humble. A French journalist, who wrote a biographical notice of him a few months after his death, says that "his grandfather, the first of the Brummells and the founder of the family, was originally a Treasury porter, a situation which he obtained through the patronage of Lord North, and that prudence and industry enabled him to give his son a good education;" also, "that he succeeded, through the kindness of the same nobleman, in procuring him employment in that office." A writer in a late periodical has asserted that Beau Brummell was the son of a confectioner; and others have described his father as having been in Lord Bute's household. But these accounts are all, or nearly all, equally incorrect. George Brummell's grandfather 


### Page 17 

was in business in Bury Street, St. James's, and might have been a confectioner, though I have no evidence, of the fact; he was buried in St. James's Churchyard, in a corner of which his tombstone may still be seen, and on it the following inscription : "Here lies the body of Mr. William Brummell, who departed this life the 3ist of March, 1770, aged 61 years." His wife's death is likewise recorded thus: "Also the remains of Mrs. Jane Brummell, who departed this life on the 27th of July, 1788, aged 73 years." An uncle of the Beau's, Benjamin Brummell, of the Treasury, who died in February, 1816, is likewise buried in the same vault. Within a few feet of Mr. Brummell's grave is that of the celebrated Tom Durfey, a tablet to whose memory is inserted in the wall of the church itself, facing the west entrance. 

Not being in affluent circumstances, Mr. Brummell, like many persons in business in the present day, let a portion of his house, and, fortunately for him and his family, not only "the spirit of Jenky arose," but Jenky himself; or, in words less Ossianic than those of the song of Scrutina,[1] his lodgings were taken by Charles Jenkinson, afterwards the first Lord Liverpool; and it is said, I know not with what truth, that his distinguished lodger was attracted to

---
[1] The Song of Scrutina, a poetical squib on the Westminster scrutiny, when, in 1784, Fox, elected a member of Parliament, defeated the Government candidates, was written by the late Sir Robert Adair, under the pseudonym of Macpherson. It will be found among the "Probationary Odes for the Laureateship," published with the Rolliad. 

### Page 18

the house by the perfect penmanship of the affiche, “Apartments to let,” written in his son’s, the Beau’s father’s, best hand.

Mr. Jenkinson, as is well known, was not only clever, but remarkably laborious; and though one of that administration contemptuously spoken of as "all the hacks," in contradistinction to the one yclept "all the talents,"[2] it should be remembered that hacks are more useful than race-horses; and that his lordship, instead of closing his career like the high-mettled racer, in a kennel, died in ermine trappings, and left a very comfortable écurie to his successors, while the "talents" hardly left a shed to theirs. 

Brummell's father was but a boy when Mr. Jenkinson came to lodge in Bury Street, but his active disposition soon attracted that gentleman's attention, and, pleased with his quickness, he made him his amanuensis, and, when joint secretary of the Treasury, in 1763, he obtained for him a clerkship in that 

[2] About 1807 a satirical poem published by Stockdale, called "All the Talents," went through several editions and was a most violent tirade against the Whigs. The author of this squib took the very appropriate name of Polypus, and it was dedicated "to the Emperor of China." The "All the Talents" ministry, said to be formed without regard to party distinction, came into office in 1806, and was composed of the following members: Lord Erskine, Lord Chancellor; Earl Fitzwilliam, President of the Council; Viscount Sidmouth, Lord Privy Seal; Lord Grenville, First Lord of the Treasury; Lord Hawick, First Lord of the Admiralty; Earl Moira, Master General of the Ordnance; Earl Spencer, Secretary of State for Home Affairs; Mr. Fox, Foreign Affairs; Mr. Windham, Secretary at War; Lord Henry Petty, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lord Ellenborough, Chief Justice, with a seat in the Cabinet. 1st Earl of Liverpool. 


### Page 19 

office. In this subordinate situation young Brummell remained for some time; but fortune is generally the friend of industry, and his unremitting attention to business and strict integrity, together with Mr. Jenkinson's recommendation, who was a Lord of the Treasury in 1767, induced his successor, Lord North, to appoint him his private secretary. This nobleman honoured him with his friendship, and continued him in this confidential post during his administration; that is, from 1770 to 1782, when the Marquis of Rockingham took office. It is rather curious that clergymen at this period sometimes held the situation of secretary to the First Lord of the Treasury; the Rev. Mr. Walker had that appointment under the Marquis, and the Rev. Mr. King under the Duke of Portland. 

Advanced thus, in all probability beyond his most sanguine expectations, Mr. Brummell's shrewdness and intelligence were constantly exerted; and he not only succeeded in obtaining emoluments under his new patron, but drew a prize in the lottery-office of Mr. Richardson, by marrying his youngest daughter. She is said to have been one of the prettiest women of her day, and not erroneously, if the artist who executed the miniature of her, now existing, was not a Lawrence, or a rival of Mr. Brummell. But though this marriage must have been a very eligible one for the young lady, it does not appear that the connection exactly suited the ideas of the Richardson family, who were fond of 


### Page 20

pedigree, and claimed to be descended from no less a personage than Sir W. Richardson, Chief Justice in the reign of James I. The shield of the Chief Justice is still to be seen in the painted window of Lincoln's Inn; and his monument, which is in Westminster Abbey, is near to that of the celebrated Dr. Busby, who wielded the birch so vigorously and successfully, during the fifty-five years that he was master of Westminster School. Mr. Richardson's objections, however, were probably softened afterwards; for another daughter was not so fortunate, and married Mr. Vernon, an actor; a third sister espoused a Mr. Hughes, a very respectable person in the City; and the fourth married a gentleman of the name of Brawn, who had a farm near Lilbourn. 

George Brummell occasionally paid a visit to his aunt Brawn; and one of the earliest episodes remembered of his childhood is, that he was one day guilty of crying most bitterly, because he could not eat any more of her ample damson tart. The eldest son of Mr. Richardson, who succeeded to the lottery-office at his father's death, was a ' great friend of the late Mr. Coutts, the banker, and an expensive man about town; he died early. The second brother was in the navy, and sailed in the Alarm frigate, the first in the service that was coppered; he was also on board the Centurion, the ship in which Lord Anson circumnavigated the globe. At his brother's death he replaced him in the lottery-office. 

How very highly Lord North appreciated the 

### Page 21 

services of Mr. Brummell, is satisfactorily proved by the lucrative appointments which that minister conferred upon him; for, at his decease, he held those of Receiver of the Duties on Uninhabited Houses in London and Middlesex, Comptroller of the Hawkers' and Pedlars' Office, and Agent and Paymaster to the Out-pensioners of Chelsea Hospital, the net salaries of which amounted to two thousand five hundred pounds per annum. As Mr. Brummell enjoyed such a handsome share of the good things in the gift of Lord North, called by the pamphleteers of the day "the God of Emolument," it was not only natural but fair, that he should occupy a prominent position in the squibs so frequently launched forth against his master, and with justice too; for perhaps no country with free institutions ever suffered so much from the obstinate " honesty," perhaps his admirers will exclaim, as England did from the colonial policy of that minister. In one of the pamphlets I have alluded to, entitled "Instructions for a Prince, with State Maxims and interesting Papers, found in the Cabinet of the King of Lunaria," the author gives the following letter from a certain secretary to a newly elected member of the House of Commons; — that secretary was Brummell's father; and the note is supposed to have been written by order of Lord North. 

> "SIR, — Permit me to congratulate you on the 
> honourable seat which you have lately obtained in so 
> honourable a manner. I inclose you, by order of my 

### Page 22

> master, Lord N, a copy of instructions drawn up 
> by himself for the use of his members. — I have the 
> honour to be, Sir, — &c., &c., &c., 
>
> WILLIAM BRUMMELL." 


The instructions to the representatives of the people were as follows : — 

> "1st. You are to use your best endeavours in bringing over the opposition. 
>
> "2nd. You are never to play the orator, lest you should stumble on unseasonable truths (applicable to some cases in the present day); an Aye or No, judiciously employed, is infinitely preferable to the finest rhetorical flourish.

>
> "4th. Good posts will be provided for your relatives and friends; but, if they cannot be immediately given, you are not to murmur, or threaten, or even talk of conscience. 
>
> "Lastly. You are to pay implicit obedience to the will of the minister." 


The expenditure of secret-service money is thus humorously made out by the same author; the initials only of the names of some were given in the original — I have filled them up.

These were indeed glorious days for the writers of " puff and panegyric." Major Topham, the editor 
of the World, actually succeeded to David Hume's 
pension.2 

After Lord North's resignation, Mr. Brummell retired to the country, and in the year 1788 served the office of high sheriff for Berkshire. In the immediate vicinity of his seat, the Grove, near Donnington Castle, a place famous for having been the residence of Chaucer, and for its spirited resistance to the Parliamentarian army in the civil wars, he was eminently distinguished by his private virtues, particularly in his exertions on behalf of the infant poor, many of whom he benevolently rescued from ignorance and destitution; and by them his loss was truly deplored — for it was felt. Nor was he forgetful of the duties of hospitality to his affluent friends; the 

[1] As the powerful may by many be thought somewhat questionable, the following extract from Captain Cook's voyage is submitted to the reader : " The fleet of Otaheite, which I then saw, consisted of 210 vessels, besides smaller ones to serve as transports, &c.; and it appears from an accurate calculation, that the whole island can furnish for immediate service 68,000 able men." No despicable assistance to Lunaria in her present despicable situation. 

[2] Major Topham died at Doncaster on the 2Oth April, 1820 : he was known to the lovers of the drama by the many prologues and epilogues which proceeded from his pen; also by several minor theatrical pieces. He likewise wrote a Biography of the celebrated and eccentric John Elwes, Esq. 

Edward To 


### Page 25 

hall-door, though it hung upon an old-fashioned hinge, yielded easily to the touch of his numerous visitors, and the Grove was universally acknowledged to be one of the most agreeable houses in the neighbourhood. That such should have been the case was not extraordinary. Mr. Brummell had for twelve years been in habits of intimacy with perhaps the most delightful of companions, who, whatever might be his political obstinacy or manoeuvring to retain office, was possessed of more bonhomie and powers of pleasing all that came within reach of his conversation, than any other of the great public men of his time. 

The society which Mr. Brummell received at Donnington was of the best and most talented description; both Fox and Sheridan visited there, and tradition has still preserved the remembrance of one of the practical jokes, in which the latter was so fond of indulging. It was played off on a Miss White, a spinster, who had passed her grand climacteric, but whose vanity was so little tempered by age, that Sheridan, in one of his frolicsome and persuasive moments, succeeded in inducing her to believe that Mr. Henry Harris, the proprietor of Covent Garden Theatre, and a guest at Donnington, was in love with her. "My dear Miss White," said Sheridan, "my friend is endowed with great sensibility; — only touch him on that point, and he is yours : " and the lady, instigated by the mischievous wit, and hoping to attract the admiration of Mr. Harris, dressed herself in the 

### Page 26

costume of one of those pastoral beauties immortalised in Chelsea china; and attired in a stiff dress of primrose brocade and gipsy hat, with pale blue ribbons, sat by the side of a pond, in the grounds, with a fishing-rod in her hand, the best part of a broiling summer's day, nervously expecting her Colin — it is needless to add, in vain. 

Under the influence of these examples, Master George Brummell doubtless cultivated his natural penchant for fun; but in the early part of the year 1793, the sounds of festivity were hushed at the Grove; death left Mr. Brummell a widower; and exactly one year and a day after his wife's burial, he was himself carried to the family vault at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, and laid beside her. This event took place the i/th of March, 1794. Mr. Brummell died, leaving two sons, and a daughter; William, the eldest, married in May, 1800, Miss Daniel (whose sister was married to a brother of Lord Gwydyr), and the daughter became the wife of a Captain Blackshaw, who resided in a cottage near the Grove. 

Mr. Brummell's youngest son, George Bryan Brummell, the subject of the present memoir, had not quite completed his sixteenth year at the time of his father's death, having been born on the 7th of June, 1778, and baptized on the 2nd of July, at St. Margaret's, West- minster. I am ignorant who on this occasion promised to answer for his anticipated misdeeds, but his second Christian name would seem to imply, that the shade of the old Irish hero came back from the world of 

### Page 27 

spirits to do him honour. A very handsome provision was left, at Mr. Brummell's death, for his three children, proving that he not only knew how to acquire money, but how to keep it; a virtue which in this, as in the generality of cases with fortunes rapidly made, did not descend, — at least to his youngest son. The sum of £65,000, which Mr. Brummell died possessed of, was placed in the hands of trustees, to be equally divided amongst his children, on their attaining their majority. The amount is so large, more particularly when it is remembered that Mr. Brummell was given to acts of hospitality, that it leads to the supposition that he speculated successfully; probably like his patron, Lord North, in the funds. 

Such was the origin of the Beau's family, and such the details I have been able to collect respecting it. He seldom touched upon the subject of his genealogical tree — never in conversation; but, in one of his notes to a lady hereafter given,[1] he appears to allude to it when he says in the commencement, " I swear to you by those humble ancestors who sleep in their parish churchyards; " — humble they were, but respectable; and it is a pity that Brummell did not content himself with the position in society their industry and better judgment had secured for him, and this he was probably brought to think by the sufferings and reverses of his later life.

At Eton, to which his father sent him in 1790, at least he appears in the list of the lower school for that year, George Brummell was remarkable for his quiet gentlemanly manners and ready wit, as well as for the excessive neatness of his personal appearance. At that time the term "dandy" was not the vogue: "bucks," and " macaronies," were then the nicknames of such as affected peculiar elegance in their dress; and, according to one authority formerly living at Eton, he was distinguished from his fellows by the sobriquet of "Buck Brummell." The anxiety with which he eschewed the dirty streets on a rainy day, his white stock with a bright gold buckle behind, and the measured dignity of his step, were remembered by his contemporaries; his language, dress, and 

### Page 29 

deportment, were in this respect always in perfect keeping. 

It frequently happened that a contest took place between the boys and the Windsor bargemen, and on one of these occasions, an unhappy bargee fell into the hands of the exasperated lads, who having been in a former row very roughly handled by these Jacob Faithfuls, gave momentary way to passion, and were literally contemplating throwing him over the bridge into the Thames. In the midst of the uproar and hauling about, fifty pulling him one way and fifty the other, Buck Brummell came over the bridge, and probably from a goodnatured motive, he, in the quietest tones of remonstrance, addressed his incensed companions as follows: "My good fellows, don't send him into the river; the man is evidently in a high state of perspiration, and it almost amounts to a certainty that he will catch cold." A finer instance of bathos seldom occurs — from drowning to catching cold! but to be sure, either might have happened, even to a bargee. This appeal of George Brummell's was irresistible; the boys took it, and in an ebullition of laughter, projected the bargeman along the road, who took to his heels and was out of sight in an instant. 

Little, however, is now remembered of Brummell at Eton; old Sukey, the purveyor of tarts and apples, died an inmate of the almshouse, but her mind was too enfeebled by age for her to recollect whether he patronised her, and if he was ever so vulgarly happy 

### Page 30

as to enjoy cranberries, bull's-eyes, or the classical elecampane; neither have I been able to ascertain, whether like other boys he hacked his desk, or cut his name on the walls. In the upper school-room, where upwards of three thousand names are cut on the oak panelling, numbering among them those of Charles Fox, and scores of others of our young nobility and commoners scarcely less distinguished in the senate, or the field — that of George Brummell does not appear. 

I was dining one day with the high sheriff of a county contiguous to the metropolis, a Nestor of Nimrods, and accidentally hearing him remark that he was at Eton in the latter part of the last century, I asked him whether he recollected Brummell there. The rough, but good humoured, old fox-hunter immediately acknowledged the acquaintance. "I knew him well, Sir," said the veteran sportsman; "he was never flogged; and a man, Sir, is not worth a d—n who was never flogged through the school." Here the conversation, to my great regret, was cut short by the under sheriff hopping into the room and announcing to his chief, who was doing the honours most admirably, that "in the great tithe cause, Smith versus Jones, a verdict had just been recorded in favour of the plaintiff." This brought on a perfect typhoon from the high sheriff, mangel wurzel, fat beasts, and the sliding-scale. I made a waiting race of it, but it was of no use; the whole of the squires present went off at score, I could never get old Hubert to hark

back to the Beau, and the evening passed without my being able to take advantage of this rencontre with a brother Etonian of my hero. 

Indeed I had some time previously completely given up all hopes of obtaining anything more relating to Brummell's school-boy days, when, through the kindness of a friend, I received a communication on the subject from a gentleman, whose name it is not necessary to mention, but from whose courteous letter I now quote the following passage : " I was three years at Eton with my old friend Brummell. We were at Dame Young's, and I was the Captain of her house, in which there were forty boys. All these three most happy years George was my fag. He was a far livelier lad than his handsome brother William; indeed no one at the school was so full of animation, fun, and wit. He was a general favourite. Our dame, his tutor, and my tutor (the father of Dr. Hawtrey), and Dr. Goodall, all petted him. You ask me whether he was pugnacious; I do not remember that he ever fought or quarrelled with any one : indeed it was impossible for any one to be more good-natured than he was. With George, afterwards General Leigh, and Lord Lake, and Jack Musters, who were all in the same house with us, and Berkeley Craven, a great pickle in his boyish days, and living at Dr. Foster's, and with all his other intimate companions, I never heard of his having a single disagreement. Like them also he was not in the least studious, but a very clever and a very idle boy, and very frank; 


### Page 32

and then, whatever he became afterwards, not in the least conceited, though Nature seemed to have supplied him with a quadruple portion of amusing repartee. 

" I recollect nothing about his fondness for athletic exercises, boating, cricket, &c., but I really believe no young Etonian was ever more popular with all his companions than George Brummell, not even excepting his celebrated namesake, George Canning. As head of the house I had two suppers of cold meat and pastry, and a double portion of bread and cheese. No toaster of bread and cheese ever surpassed or even equalled George Brummell; and I can speak from experience, as he nightly toasted mine most delicately for three years. When the toasting was over he divided it into two as equal parts as he could, and I choose mine first. When I divided what he had toasted, he always had the first choice. 

" About two years after he had been at Eton, his father having been informed of some peccadillo he had committed, sent his butler from Donnington with a paternal letter to his eldest son, which began, ' My dear William,' and another to the Beau, commencing, ' George.' George's letter was in other respects a most disagreeable one, intimating as it did the order for his immediate return, with all his clothes; his father having determined not to allow him to return again to Eton. Hearing of his trouble I went to his room, and found him with the two letters before him : they were wet with tears, which, parvis componere 


### Page 33 

magna, fell, if not like the Falls of Niagara, like those of the Clyde; — such a stream of tears I never saw, and have never seen since. ' George,' said I, ' what's the matter? ' He could not speak; but, sobbing, pointed first to — ' My dear William,' and then to the monosyllable ' George.' I give you this anecdote as a trait of his being possessed, at least at this time, of a warm heart. His father's relented also, for after the next holidays George reappeared amongst his companions, the most manly boy of them all." 

The only person who appears to have been unfavourably disposed towards the young Etonian was Dr. Langford, one of the masters of the Lower School, who frequently forwarded a true and particular account of his delinquencies to the Grove; but it does not appear that he was himself immaculate. Abraham Moore wittily remarked of this reverend gentleman, when he was elected to a vacant fellowship, that his success proved the truth of the poet's observation, that " worth makes the man — the want of it a fellow ! " Brummell was in the fifth form in 1793, the year he left Eton, and though he took very good care that none of his companions should impute to him the intention of succeeding the head master, he left the college a gentlemanly scholar; and also with an ample share of that precocious worldliness, of which a public school generally imparts some to the dullest comprehension. It was this, together with the originality of his character, his good humour, vivacity, and ready address, that gave him an ascendancy over his school- 

### Page 34

fellows; a position which his classical attainments or superior physical power never would have procured him. 

From Eton he went to Oxford, and entered at Oriel College. Here, according to Mr. Lister, in Granby,[1]  he rapidly progressed in the exclusive habits to which he had shown himself predisposed, the little that remained of schoolboy frankness was quickly thrown aside in his violent desire to be perfectly correct; and, to gratify this taste, he cut one of his brother Etonians, because he entered at a junior college; and discontinued visiting another, because he had invited him to meet two men of Hall. The plan which he acted upon was to make intimacies with men of high rank and con- nections: he was a consummate tuft-hunter; and to 
the preservation of an embryo baronet or earl, he fancied it necessary to sacrifice a friend a term. 

He consumed a considerable quantity of midnight oil; but very little of it over his books : and it was not so much from a meritorious motive, as a wish 'to do something that nobody thought he could or would do, that he wrote for the Newdigate prize.[2] It is true he was not successful; but his copy was considered the second best, and he contrived to make people believe that he would have been, if he had 

[1] A novel, written by T. W. Lister, which produced a great sensation, was published in 1826, and was said to contain in Trebeck a portrait of Brummell, drawn to the life. 

[2] The Newdigate prize for English poetry, established in 1719 by Sir Robert Newdigate. 


### Page 35 

taken sufficient pains; for his friends asserted that his failure was mainly owing to his indolence, in having neglected to count his verses. He was more celebrated, however, for his systematic violation of college rules than for his stanzas; he always ordered his horse at hall-time, was the author of half the squibs that appeared on the screen, turned a tame jackdaw, with a pair of bands on, into the quadrangle, to parody the master, and treated all proctors' and other penalties with contempt." 

This account of Brummell's college career is probably correct as far as relates to his studies : he, no doubt, gave himself very little trouble about lectures, and, like the generality of under-graduates, was wise enough not to importune his tutor for instruction; but the accusation of cutting an old schoolfellow, and a friend a term, may fairly be doubted, for it does not at all accord with the character given of him by his captain at Eton, nor by those of his contemporaries at Oriel, with whom the author is acquainted. It seems, indeed, as if Mr. Lister had imagined this college sketch, to make it correspond with the habits and disposition of Trebeck in after-life. 

But although he did not devote himself to study, he gained from a fellow Oxonian some useful information in the line that he intended to take : this gentleman, a Mr. E , was famous for his comic songs and good stories, and many of these he imparted to Brummell, who afterwards gave them with such good effect at the wine-parties of his 


### Page 36

friends, that he left the university with a better reputation for wit and fun than his instructor. Having added these qualifications to the many he possessed when he arrived at this seat of learning, he took an early leave of Alma Mater, and three months after his father's death, viz., on the 17th of June, 1794, was gazetted to a cornetcy in the Tenth Hussars, at this time commanded by the Prince of Wales. 

According to Brummell's own statement, he had been presented to the heir-apparent on the Terrace at Windsor, when a boy at Eton; and he used to say that his subsequent intimacy with His Royal Highness grew out of the slight notice with which he was then favoured. A contemporary and friend of his told me that, on his arrival in London, some of the caterers for the Prince's amusement informed him that the young Etonian had grown up a second Selwyn, upon which His Royal Highness intimated a desire to see him again. A party was accordingly made for this purpose, and George, not being embarrassed by any real modesty, as many similarly situated would have been, acquitted himself so much to the Prince's satisfaction, that the fortunate result was the gift of the cornetcy already spoken of. 

Adorned with the rich uniform of the Tenth, which his slight but handsome figure was well calculated to show off, and brought forward under the auspices of his royal patron, Brummell found himself at once in the highest society in the country, — in a position that in all probability he had never dreamed of 


H.R.H. George, Prince of Wales 


### Page 37 

attaining, even in his most sanguine and ambitious moments. The intimacies also, which he formed with several of his brother officers, no doubt contributed to facilitate his reception in families of the highest rank and fashion; for amongst them were Lord Petersham, Lords R. E. Somerset, Charles Ker, Charles and Robert Manners, and the Honourables Bligh and Lumley. 

Though Brummell was only sixteen years of age, a mere boy, when he entered the Tenth, and the Prince was then two-and-thirty, his partiality for the young cornet did not surprise those who were about His Royal Highness, for he was well known to have a strong predilection for companions who had any marked peculiarities of character about them; hence his former intimacy with Lord Barrymore, George Hanger, and several others. George Brummell was an original too, and a genius in his way; for how could his wit, assurance, and agreeable manners have been acquired at that early age? Many were the marks of royal favour bestowed upon him; and with that precipitation of preference which characterised His Royal Highness's conduct towards his favourites, he was soon placed on a footing of intimacy wholly inconsistent with their relative positions in life. 

The Tenth were almost always either at Brighton or in London; and on the arrival of the Princess Caroline of Brunswick to celebrate her marriage with the heir-apparent, a party of the regiment, commanded by Lord Edward Somerset, escorted her 


### Page 38

from Greenwich to St. James's. At the august ceremony Brummell was in personal attendance upon the Prince as a kind of chevalier d'honnour; he also went down with the happy couple to Windsor, and his description of the honeymoon was in strong contrast to the one given by the Princess herself in the " Diary illustrative of the Times of George the Fourth." 

Brummell's account of these espousals must, however, have been tolerably authentic, as he went the next morning to take the Prince's orders while His Royal Highness was still at his toilet, when he certainly received no unfavourable impression from the conversation that took place. When I heard him relate the circumstances, it was years after he left England; and he certainly had no lingering admiration, at that time, for his former friend. He said that nothing could go off better; that " the young couple appeared perfectly satisfied with each other, particularly the Princess : she was then a very handsome and desirable-looking woman; " and it was only, according to Brummell's version of the story, when the intrigues of some old ladies about the court began to take effect, that any disagreement between them became apparent. 

Once included in the brilliant circle that surrounded the Prince of Wales, he rapidly established a reputation for wit and refinement, and soon became a great favourite with the fair sex. The following anecdote will illustrate this remark : — At a ball given by a great 


### Page 39 

law lord in the neighbourhood of Russell Square, at which, amongst a very numerous assemblage of the beau monde, a Miss J , afterwards Lady G H , was present, a circumstance occurred which proved that he understood the difficult art of making himself agreeable to a proud woman. 

Miss J was a magnificent creature, and of course the greatest attention was paid her; but though surrounded by ardent admirers, not one of them had sufficient influence to induce her to dance. Like a spoiled beauty as she was, she declined the offers of one and all of them. Quite late in the evening, however, Cornet Brummell was announced, and he had scarcely made his bow to her, when this difficile lady, who had probably been waiting for him, rose from her chair, and giving her hand to the new arrival, was soon seen figuring away amongst a crowd of the discarded who had sought that hand in vain. As the Beau approached one of them, my informant, he inquired, with an air of great curiosity, who the ugly man near the chimney-piece might be? " Why surely, my good fellow, you know him," said his acquaintance; " that is the master of the house ! " " No," replied the unconscious cornet, " how should I? I was never invited." 

When Brummell was with his regiment he was the life and soul of the mess, for his original wit and collection of good stories were inexhaustible; and at the dinner-table he always kept his brother officers in roars of laughter. As to duty, he did little or none; 

### Page 40

and when late for parade, which was very often the case, he would ride up to the commanding officer and disarm him with some queer apology, half-impudence half-excuse, which was generally accepted, for he was popular, and the colonel good-natured. But he was so much about the Prince that he was seldom present with the corps; and the gallant Tenth did not therefore benefit much by his services. When, unfortunately for the country, he was with them, it is said that he did not actually know his own troop; but happily for him, one of his front-rank men had a very large blue nose: this feature was Brummell's beacon; and when coming on parade, which, as I have said before, was frequently ten minutes too late, he galloped along'i'the line, or between the squadrons, until he arrived at the nose. Here he reined up and took his place in the front or rear, as the case might be. 

On one occasion, however, some recruits having joined the ranks from drill, a transfer of men was made, and several were drawn from the front rank of his troop and sent to another. At the next parade that he attended, and several days after this alteration, he found the regiment already in line, and ignorant of course of all the arrangements that had been made at the barracks in the meantime, he rode up and down as usual, and at length stopped opposite his nose — his blue nose. "How now, Mr. Brummell!" vociferated the colonel, "you are with the wrong troop." "No, no," muttered the Beau, turning round in his saddle, and looking confidently first at his invaluable nose, 


### Page 41 

and then at the colonel, adding, in a suppressed tone, "I know better than that; a pretty thing indeed if I did not know my own troop!" 

One of his brother officers humorously told me, that he attended to his duty infinitely better after he had left the regiment than he did when he belonged to it; for he seldom passed within twenty miles of their quarters, without turning out of his road, and paying them a visit. On one of these itinerant calls, he drove into the barrackyard at Canterbury in his carriage, with four posters. "Halloo, George!" said a friend from the mess-room window, "when did you take to four horses?" — "Only since my valet gave me warning for making him travel with a pair." This was Brummell's usual mode of reply, ever ready with some droll excuse for his follies or extravagance. 

Rapid as was his promotion, for he commanded a troop in less than three years after he entered the service, having been promoted to the rank of captain, on the 1st of June 1796; and little as he was inconvenienced by his military duties, he did not care to put up with any further interference with his independence; for as soon as the novelty of the thing wore off, he began to think of retiring. This he did, in the very early part of 1798; the disturbed state of Europe, the wailings of the anti-Jacobin, and the splendid declamations of Burke, in the cause of suffering humanity, having failed to induce him to seek "a reputation at the cannon's mouth!" 

With such brilliant prospects of advancement as 

### Page 42

Captain Brummell had before him, it is difficult to say what was his reason for taking so unwise a step; perhaps it was his anxiety to exchange his club for White's, or emancipate his head from hair-powder, which was still worn in the army. 

This absurd fashion of powdering the hair originated in the whim of a French mountebank at a fair, who, to get an extra laugh out of his audience, greased his head, dredged it with flour, and then grinned horribly.[1] But though powder was still worn in the army when Brummell left the service, it had been gradually falling into disuse in society in England, since the tax had been laid upon it by Mr. Pitt three years before; to evade this impost, many speculators brought forward powder made of other materials than flour; amongst them was Lord William Murray, a son of the Duke of Atholl, who took out a patent, in 1796, for making starch from horse-chestnuts. 

The fatal blow, however, was given to this custom by Francis Duke of Bedford and his friends, who, in order more effectually to disappoint Mr. Pitt of the revenue that he very reasonably hoped to realise, from 

---
[1] An acquaintance accuses me of having mistaken the origin of wearing hair-powder, and certainly gives a more probable reason for the adoption of it amongst the mountebanks. "Hair powder," he observes, "was worn by French ladies in the reign of Louis XIV. (see a portrait in one of the bedrooms at Cassiobury), and was first patronised by women whose beauty was on the wane to enable them to conceal their gray hairs. How could a grinning mountebank induce the fine ladies of Versailles to copy his head? These buffoons covered their heads with powder, or rather flour, to laugh at a practice which the ladies at Court had adopted, and to satirise, and make fun of them." (See also Notes and Queries, January — June 1884, pp. 90, 137, 178, 232.) 


### Page 43 

an article so intimately connected with the vanities and fashions of the day, entered into an engagement to forfeit a certain sum of money, if any of them wore their hair tied or powdered, within a certain period. Accordingly, in the September of 1795, a general cropping, washing, and combing-out of hair took place at Woburri Abbey — probably in the powdering room; an apartment dedicated to the powder-puff, in the houses of most gentlemen in those days. Amongst the Absaloms present on this startling occasion, this anti-pigtail plot, were the Marquis of Anglesea, Lord Jersey, and Sir Harry Featherstone; Lord William Russell, Mr. Lambton, the father of the late Lord Durham; and Messrs. Anthony and Robert Lee, Trevers, Button, Day, and Vernon.[1] 

---
[1] The following extracts from the Times newspaper, Sept. 25 and 29 for the year 1795, taken from Ashton's "Old Times," will illustrate this still better : — 

"The following noblemen and gentlemen were of the party with the Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey, when a general cropping and combing-out of hair-powder took place: Lord W. Russell, Lord Villiers, Lord Paget, &c. &c. They entered into an engagement to forfeit a sum of money if any of them wore their hair tied, or powdered, within a certain period. Many noblemen and gentlemen in the county of Bedford have since followed the example: it has become general with the gentry in Hampshire, and the ladies have left off wearing powder." 

"THE BEDFORD CROPS. — Something has at last fallen from this party to entertain the public. We hope they will find their heads cooler for this salutary operation. Dr. Willis (a physician for the insane) is of opinion, that more than one of them ought to have been shaved. If the Shavees think by publishing their names they will gain proselytes, till their absurdity is lost in the crowd, they are mistaken. Can it be supposed that a few drunken persons in a frolic will be followed by the sober part of the people of England." 

"The new Crop is called the Bedford Level" 

### Page 44

But, in spite of this opposition on the part of the leading Whigs, there stilled remained energetic supporters of powder and the minister; amongst these were to be numbered all the elderly ladies, who naturally enough patronised a habit that made the young and old appear equally gray. Their exertions, however, were fruitless; and the Treasury was amusingly charged with entertaining the idea of taxing the substitute which eventually replaced their powder, and, to make up for the unlooked-for deficiency in the tax, it was proposed that a return should be made of false hair, whether worn in scratches or fronts; but the perruquiers defied Nature, and the plan, if ever contemplated, was relinquished. 

But at the time Brummell left the Tenth, it was highly desirable that the use of powder should be countermanded in the army; for a scarcity of corn was seriously felt, and the following calculation, made when the powder-tax was first imposed, shows how much of this invaluable article of food was uselessly consumed in that service alone. The military force of the United Kingdom and our Colonies at this period, including foot, horse, militia, and fencibles, amounted to two hundred and fifty thousand men; each of whom was supposed to use a pound of flour per week : this made no less a sum than six thousand five hundred tons weight a year; a quantity sufficient to make three millions, fifty-nine thousand, three hundred and fifty-three quartern loaves, and to supply fifty thousand persons with bread for that period. The scarcity 

### Page 45 

two years after Brummell's retirement, viz., in July 1800, was so great, that the consumption of flour for pastry was prohibited in the Royal Household, rice 
being used instead; the distillers left off malting, 
hackney-coach fares were raised twenty-five per 
cent., and Wedgewood made dishes to represent 
pie-crust. 

But to return to Brummell, though probably he 
was sufficiently annoyed at being obliged to wear 
powder when it was going out of fashion, his prin- 
cipal reason for leaving the profession was, his objec- 
tion to being quartered in a manufacturing town; at 
all events, it was the one that he chose to assign. It 
appears his regiment was at Brighton when they sud- 
denly and unexpectedly received an order to march 
for Manchester. The news arrived late one evening, 
and early the next morning Brummell, according to 
the account he gave me, made his way to the Prince, 
who expressed some surprise that he should be 
favoured with a visit from him at such an unusual 
hour, when the Beau, after due apology, said — " Why 
the fact is, your Royal Highness, I have heard that 
we are ordered to Manchester. Now you must be 
aware, how disagreeable this would be to me; I really 
could not go — think, your Royal Highness, Man- 
chester 1 Besides," and here was an instance of his 
tact, "you would not be there. I have, therefore, 
with your Royal Highness's permission, determined to 
sell out." — " Oh ! by all means, Brummell," said the 
Prince, " do as you please, do as you please." And 


### Page 46

accordingly he resigned with the most perfect indif- 
ference, and before he was of age, his troop in the 
Tenth — at that time the most dashing regiment in the 
army I l 

1 " This conversation about Manchester," observes BrummelPs friend 
Jack Robinson, "is utterly unworthy of him and impossible; he was 
incapable of it" All I can say is that Brummell told the anecdote to 
my friend Wells and other persons at Caen. But it is possible his 
reason for leaving the Tenth was that the expense exceeded his 
means, and that he wanted the money with which he purchased his 
commissions.

BUT the profession of arms was decidedly not Brum- 
mell's proper vocation, and the service did not suffer 
severely by his resignation; the least restraint or 
compulsory exertion was perfectly repugnant to his 
nature, and the trifling inconveniences of a soldier's 
life, even in England, were in the last degree unlikely 
to suit a young man who seemed created on purpose 
to personify elegant idleness. A year after he left the 
army he came into possession of his fortune, which 
having accumulated during his minority, amounted to 
thirty thousand pounds. 

Being now master of his time as well as of his 
money, he determined to devote himself to a life of 
pleasure, and the first step he took towards the 
accomplishment of his design, was to establish him- 
self, with all the means and appliances of comfort, in 


### Page 48

No. 4 Chesterfield Street, May Fair; in which street, 
by the by, George Selwyn also resided. There, 
with the assistance of a man-cook, who formed one 
item in his small but recherche menage, he gave some 
excellent little dinners; his guests were congenial 
spirits, and on the authority of a noble duke, I can 
say, that even the Prince honoured them with his 
presence. 

But while he preserved all the appearances neces- 
sary to support the position he had acquired in society, 
there was nothing outrageously extravagant in his 
general routine of expenditure : at this time, he was 
wise enough not to play, and his stud consisted only 
of a couple of horses to enable him to air himself in 
the Park. 

It has already been observed, that Brummell's 
figure was well set off by his hussar uniform, but it 
should be clearly understood that it derived no other 
advantage from it; the reverse of which is the case 
with so many young men who hide a bad one under 
the attractive shelter of regimentals. Nature had 
indeed been most liberal to him in this respect; he 
was about the same height as the Apollo, and the just 
proportions of his form were remarkable; his hand 
was particularly well-shaped, and, had he been inclined 
to earn his livelihood after his flight from London, he 
would readily have found an engagement as a life- 
sitter to an artist, or got well paid to perambulate 
France from fair to fair, to personate the statuary of 
the ancients. 


### Page 49 

His face was rather long, and complexion fair; his 
whiskers inclined to sandy, and hair light brown.1 
His features were neither plain nor handsome, but his 
head was well-shaped, the forehead being unusually 
high; showing, according to phrenological develop- 
ment, more of the mental than the animal passions — 
the bump of self-esteem was very prominent. His 
countenance indicated that he possessed considerable 
intelligence, and his mouth betrayed a strong disposi- 
tion to indulge in sarcastic humour; this was pre- 
dominant in every feature, the nose excepted, the 
natural regularity of which, though it had been broken 
by a fall from his charger, preserved his countenance 
from degenerating into comicality. His eyebrows 
were equally expressive with his mouth, and while the 
latter was giving utterance to something very good- 
humoured or polite, the former, and the eyes them- 
selves, which were gray and full of oddity, could 
assume an expression that made the sincerity of his 
words very doubtful. 

This flexibility of feature enabled Brummell to give 
additional point to his humorous or satirical remarks; 
his whole physiognomy giving the idea that, had he 
devoted himself to dramatic composition, he would have 
written in a tone far more resembling that of the "School 
for Scandal " than the " Gamester," or any plot develop- 
ing reflection and deep feeling. His voice was very 
pleasing. 

[1] Hulse, the court page, told me that his hair was thin and light, and 
that Robinson, his valet, turned it with the irons, when it looked very nice. 
VOL. I, D 


50 THE LIFE OF 

Having described his person, it is high time to 
advert to the point in Brummell's character which pro- 
cured him the sobriquet of Beau — his taste in dress 
and great attention to it. On this subject, he has 
been much misrepresented; and it is strange how 
very few persons there are out of the class with whom 
he associated, who appear to be aware that he pos- 
sessed a single idea that did not originate in his glass 
or his wardrobe. By the majority, he is considered 
to have been an overdressed and finical puppy; and 
he is represented by a journalist of modern days, to 
have worn a dove-coloured coat and white satin 
inexpressibles, with an artificial scented clove carna- 
tion in his button-hole. 

" This the early period of his life, and not the least 
important part of it," says the Revue de Paris, " was 
signalised by the famous pair of gloves, to ensure the 
perfection of which two glovers were employed; one 
being charged exclusively with the making of the 
thumbs, the other, the fingers and the rest of the 
hand; " in accordance, I suppose, with the grand 
principle of the subdivision of labour. The author of 
" Pelham " has improved upon this, and assigns three as 
the number of glovers employed in this achievement. 

" At this time," says the same feuilletoniste, " three 
coiffeurs were engaged to dress his hair, one for the 
temples, one for the front, and the third for his 
occiput : his boots were drees au vin de Champagne, 
and the ties of his cravats designed by the first portrait 
painter in London, who only became the rage when 


### Page 51 

Brummell had entrusted him with this delicate and sacred task." In other words, the author of this pamphlet would have his readers believe that he was an *incroyable*. In this light he is always viewed by foreigners, and Alfred de Musset, in *Les Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie*, thus alludes to him in apostrophising the Muses:

> *"Muses ! depuis le jour où John Bull en silence Vit jadis par Brummell, en dépit de la France, (Exemple monstrueux) traîner les pantalons Jusqu'à,"* &c. &c".

Another witty Frenchman,[1] anxious for information on the subject of the English Beau, wrote me the following characteristic letter, in which he evidently asks for the most minute details of Brummell's life:

> *"Quelles ont été les relations de Brummell avec Sheridan, Fox, Erskine? Étaient-ce plus que des relations de monde? Brummell avait-il des passions? Qu’étaient-elles? Était-il joueur, ivrogne, libertin, etc.? Était-il marié? a-t-il pu vivre avec sa femme? Avait-il des maîtresses en pied? Lui a-t-on connu des maîtresses publiques? Je ne parle pas des bonnes fortunes... A-t-il eu une femme étiquetée à son nom, et quelle était cette femme? — détails sur ce point. Quel était son tempérament? sait-on l’emploi de sa journée? était-il capricieux dans la distribution et l’occupation de ses heures ou routinier? ... a-t-il"*

---

> *laissé des memoranda? Il a laissé des aphorismes. Ne pourrai-je en avoir quelques-uns? Je suis moins curieux de ses vers : des aphorismes me serviraient bien davantage; les vers d’un homme montrent plus ou moins de talent, mais un homme est tout entier dans ses idées générales. A-t-il servi dans le 10e de dragons? Quel était son grade? L’aventure du ‘nez cassé’ et celle du ‘pavillon de Brighton’ sont-elles authentiques? La mesure exacte de ses rapports avec le prince de Galles? Son portrait physique et quelques anecdotes? J’y tiens moins qu’aux aphorismes, mais les aphorismes j’y tiens beaucoup, parce que l’homme entier est là. ... Encore une question. Pitt portait d’ordinaire un habit bleu et un gilet chamois; Brummell affectait-il une certaine couleur aussi, ou les portait-il toutes avec une même souveraineté? En somme, autant de détails extérieurs que possible? Quand il s’agit de Brummell, la manière dont il coupait ses ongles est importante. L’âme se mêle à tout, dit Mme. de Staël."*

Our own great lyric poet seems also to have entertained a similar opinion of him, when he makes Mr. Bob Fudge remark to his friend —

> "There goes a French dandy: ah! Dick, unlike some ones  
> We’ve seen about White’s, the Mounseers are but rum ones.  
> Such hats! fit for monkeys: I’d back Mrs. Draper  
> To cut better weather-boards out of brown paper;  
> And coats, how I wish, if it would not distress ’em,  
> They’d club for old Brummell from Calais to dress ’em!"

Yet these lines will bear a more liberal construction;


### Page 53 

and perhaps the poet brings him forward more in reference to his good taste on this subject, and with a view to the correction of dandyism in others, than as a culprit in foppishness himself. It is surely in irony that, in his description of a great fete at Carlton House, he makes Brummell so interested in a pea-green coat ! and says — 

> Come to our fete, and show again 
> That pea-green coat, thou pink of men, 
> Which charm'd all eyes that last survey'd it, 
> When Brummell's self inquired 'Who made it?'

It would be unjust indeed to Brummell's memory if I neglected to show the impropriety of calling him a 
"dandy": the few associations connected with the 
term all teem with vulgarity; the tap-room measure 
of that name is not an example of refinement, and 
in Johnson the nearest approach to the word is the 
Dandelion, a vulgar flower ! But, if in the true 
etymological style we divide the word, with the hope 
of improving its credit, what does the first syllable 
bring to mind? Somebody quite as notorious as 
Brummell, but whose follies have been far more mis- 
chievous; whose eloquence is great, but certainly not 
always refined : and to whose health many a dandy 
of whisky has been tossed off.1 The thing, the

" dandy," however, still exists, and will do so to the 
end of time; but the term is nearly obsolete, and has 
been replaced by the " tiger " in England, and, oddly 
enough, by the " lion " in France. 

The only " dandies " I ever knew that do in any 
way relieve the just imputation of egregious folly at- 
tached to that outre character, are those the traveller 
meets with in Hindustan — beings half fish, half men — 
the boatmen of the Ganges; and good reason have I 
to remember them, for they ran away one day from our 
budgerow, because, when walking on the bank, my 
shadow had passed over their cooking-pot, and they 
vowed that I had thereby spoiled their dinner. Vishnu 
alone knows whether this was true or false; all I can 
say is, they made a terrible commotion, and left me 
and my brother subaltern on the shore to mourn their 
departure. 

" The bark was still there, but the ' Dandies ' were gone." 

I was then inexperienced in the enlightened doctrines 
of Bramah; but after I had been a short time in the 
country, I found it was really necessary to look after 
my shadow, not only out of respect to " civil and 
religious liberty all over the world," but out of regard 
to my own convenience, which was of much more con- 
sequence; and often when landing from my boat, after 

cendant merit as a statesman, orator, and philanthropist, is also a 
distinguished literary man, was, when his book appeared, the inmate of 
a prison. The feelings of a gentleman, therefore, and of a British 
officer, should have induced him to have repressed this silly and malig- 
nant attempt at pleasantry." 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 55 

the day's tracking was over, and the bank was crowded 
with cooking-pots, for these boatmen never cook on 
board, I would gladly have been like Peter Schlemihl.1 
There was certainly something very peculiar in the 
dress of these Dandies; it was simply a rag round 
their waists, and not generally very clean; but our 
countrywomen in India look upon Nature thus primi- 
tively draped with the utmost composure : never, to the 
best of my recollection, have I seen a blush mantle the 
cheek of a new arrival; far be it from me, however, 
to insinuate that a want of modesty was the cause of 
this — the Dandies are black ! 

If, as I apprehend, glaring extravaganzas in dress 
— such, for instance, as excessive padding, trousers 
containing cloth enough for a coat besides, shirt-collars 
sawing off the wearer's ears and the corners threatening 
to put out his eyes, wristbands intruding upon his 
plate, or an expansive shirt-front like a miniature 
bleachgreen, &c., &c. — constitute dandyism, Brummell 
most assuredly was no dandy. 

He was a beau, but not a beau of the Sir Fopling 
Flutter 2 or Fielding school; nor would he, like Charles 
James Fox, have been guilty of wearing red-heeled 
shoes ! He was a beau in the literal sense of the 
word, — " fine, handsome." As an auxiliary to his 
success in society, he determined to be the best-dressed

man in London, and, in the commencement of his 
career, he, perhaps, varied his dress too frequently; the 
whim, however, was of short duration, and, scorning 
to share his fame with his tailor, he soon shunned all 
external peculiarity, and trusted alone to that ease 
and grace of manner which he possessed in a remark- 
able degree. 

His chief aim was to avoid anything marked; one 
of his aphorisms being, that the severest mortification 
a gentleman could incur was, to attract observation 
in the street by his outward appearance. He exercised 
the most correct taste in the selection of each article 
of apparel, of a form and colour harmonious with all 
the rest, for the purpose of producing a perfectly ele- 
gant general effect; and no doubt he spent much time 
and pains in the attainment of his object. 

According to Wraxall, dress at this period had 
become exceedingly slovenly. " That costume," he 
observes, "which is now confined to the levee or 
drawing-room, was then worn by persons of condition, 
with few exceptions, everywhere and every day. Mr. 
Fox and his friends, who might be said to dictate to 
the town, affecting a style of neglect about their persons, 
and manifesting a contempt of all the usages hitherto 
established, first threw a sort of discredit on dress. 
From the House of Commons, and the clubs in St. 
James's Street, it spread through the private assem- 
blies of London. But, though gradually undermined, 
and insensibly perishing of an atrophy, dress never 
fell till the era of Jacobinism and of Equality, in 1793 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 57 

and 1794. It was then that pantaloons, cropped hair, 
and shoe-strings, as well as the total abolition of buckles 
and ruffles, together with the disuse of hair-powder, 
characterised the men; while ladies (having cut off those 
tresses, which had done so much execution, and one lock 
of which purloined, gave rise to the finest model of mock- 
heroic poetry which our own, or any other, language 
can boast), exhibited heads rounded ' a la victime, et a 
la guillotine,' as if ready for the stroke of the axe." 

About the beginning of this century the late Lord 
Jersey's servant was the first to introduce the common 
blacking now in use. It was, of course, much sought 
after, particularly by the members of the Melton hunt, 
many of whom paid this gentleman's gentleman five 
guineas for the receipt, so that he made a small fortune. 
Fashion, about the year 1800, was infinitely more 
tyrannical than it is now. At that time nothing could 
exceed the outre character of ladies' dresses or their 
extreme indelicacy. Public decency, as evinced by 
the drama, was certainly improved, but the beauties of 
Charles the Second's time looked like soeurs de charite 
when compared with the uncovered come-and-look-at- 
me ladies of this period. " While fashion," says a 
morning journalist, " strips the beauty of St. James's 
of the encumbrance of dress, the beauty of St. Giles's 
is hurried into nakedness in spite of the weather by 
insurance in the Lottery * and visits to the gin-shop. 
The muslin draperies of the former reminded the

spectator of one of those elegant dishes of Weltje's,1 
in which a fish or a bird is seen (the latter of course 
without its plumage), through a covering of jelly, neither 
exposed or concealed." An old lawyer at the opera 
observed that in a little time there would not be afemme 
couverte 2 in the nation, and another critic, fond of 
statistics, calculated, that owing to this fashion of 
wearing muslin, eighteen ladies caught fire, and 
eighteen thousand caught cold. Hair-powder had, it 
is true, thanks to the Duke of Bedford, been shaken 
off, and the Grecian style introduced from the court of 
the First Consul 3 into that of our own; toupets had 
also been abandoned, and hoops were almost matters 
of history; but, with all this reform, female dress 
continued extremely singular and devoid of taste. The 
short waist must have looked abominable, nor could 
the habit of picking up the train and pulling it through 
the pocket hole, before dancing, have had a very elegant 
appearance. In the article of female attire the "Aerial" 
appears to have been the most popular dress. It was 
made of white muslin, the body plain, and trimmed round 
the bosom with lace, whilst the sleeves were of lace and 
muslin; the drapery went over the left shoulder, and

Emperor on the iSth of May 1804.

was fastened in different parts with gold and silver 
sliders, or diamonds, and had silver trimmings round 
the bottom. White ostrich feathers fixed at the back 
of the head fell over the front, and an "indispensable" 
was the favourite jewel, whilst gold chains and neck- 
laces had [also to be worn by a lady in full dress. 
Another dress was the Russian robe of velvet trimmed 
all round with silver; the bottom of the train was also 
trimmed with the same material. The cap called the 
" Amanthis " was of white spangled crape, with a 
wreath of flowers on the left side. Velvet was 
generally worn both as a trimming and in the head- 
dress. The hair was in braid and curls, and, with a 
solitary exception, without powder and ornamented 
with plumes and birds of Paradise feathers. Silver 
and gold flowers, and ornaments of all kinds with 
crape and velvet netting, plain, spangled, beaded and 
bugled, were much introduced into caps and bonnets. 
To match the spangled nets, a beautiful flower, the 
lily of the valley, with corresponding wreaths, was 
made. The feathers, usually worn, were those of 
the Argus pheasant, the Indian macaw, the argilla, the 
flat and porcupine ostrich and the Seringapatam plume. 
Diamonds were the rage, as indeed they have always 
been with women, since they were first discovered; 
and, though pastry was forbidden at the Palace in 
consequence of the great scarcity of corn, paste was 
worn by those whose jewels were at their jeweller's 
or the fashionable pawnbroker's. Earrings were 
short instead of long; some were in single drops, 


### Page 60

others in clusters, and some were of a circular ring shape. Bandeaux of various kinds, with precious stones of different colours, were made in patterns of oak and laurel leaf.

At the birthday ball of the late Queen Charlotte, in 1800, the Duchess of York was dressed in a petticoat richly embroidered in purple and gold wheat ears, terminating at the bottom with a border of geranium leaves entwined with gold. Over the petticoat was a magnificent Indian sash, looped up at the left side by a rich cord and tassels, whilst the body and train were of white satin embroidered with gold and ornamented with purple to correspond. The full dress in the month of July of this year was a black 
muslin over pink sarsnet, satin ribbands, black elastic 
velvet and antique gems and chains. Surely there 
"vas in all this enough to throw Lord Ogleby l into a 
more profuse perspiration than " hot rolls and butter." 
The walking dress must have done so to the wearer, 
if not to his lordship. It consisted of a silk pelisse 
trimmed with broad black lace, hat of purple chip or 
willow, with a bow behind and white roses on the left 
side, also a " silver bear muff" — in the dog days ! ! 
Leghorn hats were then from thirty-five shillings to 
two guineas a piece, and it was these prices that 
brought in the simple English straws. The vehicles 
were as low as the dresses; a tall footman might very

easily have set astride on the top of a fashionable 
carriage, if it were not for fear of splashing his stock- 
ings. The most superb equipages were launched on 
the queen's birthday alluded to above; those of the 
Marquis and Marchioness of Donegal particularly 
attracted attention, for exclusiveness was then so much 
the vogue that man and wife were separated when 
going to court, the vis a vis of the Marquis on this 
occasion preceding her ladyship's carriage, whilst two 
tall footmen stood behind each of them, in magnificent 
liveries and miniature greenhouses on their breasts, 
so that although carrying only one person inside, 
these vehicles were constructed for and actually did 
carry three out. This custom might have arisen in 
the days of hoops, but there were no hoops at this 
time. Minuets also were rather on the decline, and 
were danced only at this birthday ball by two dukes, 
an English prince and two other nobles of high rank, 
whilst ten couples stood up for country dances, and 
the company separated at eleven ! 

In Paris the fashion changed as rapidly as politics, 
and the Parisians of 1800, emerging from the accu- 
mulated horrors of the Revolution, made, with the char- 
acteristic legerete of the nation, of that city one vast 
ballet. Dancing came into fashion with the celebrated 
Vestris, and every one was on tiptoe. The cutting 
off of heads ended in the cutting of capers, and 
politics which had hitherto absorbed every mind, were 
voted, by universal consent, disgusting. Ma foi, a 
lady is reputed to have said, c'est une chose asses

ennuyeuse que la politique f on se serf toujours des memes 
mots, des memes ide'es; il n'y a point de varie'te. II est 
assez cruel — this was the climax — d'avoir un mari 
toujours a nos cdte's au bal masque de F Opera. Still the 
French continued to originate and provide us with the 
externals of dress, and hardly ever adopted or copied 
one of our fashions, though they would willingly 
have received the materials for some of the dresses as 
well as certain articles of toilette. Talleyrand begged 
hard that one of his couriers might be permitted to bring 
over four razors from England, and the Empress Josd- 
phine condescended to petition our Government for six 
pair of cotton stockings which were forwarded to her 
Majesty agreeably to the pattern sent. 

Brummell was one of the first who revived and 
improved a taste for dress amongst gentlemen; and 
his great innovation was effected upon neckcloths : 
they were then worn without stiffening of any kind, and 
bagged out in front, rucking up to the chin in a roll; 
to remedy this obvious awkwardness and inconvenience, 
he used to have his slightly starched; and a reasoning 
mind must allow, that there is not much to object to 
in this reform. 

He did not, however, like the dandies, test their 
fitness for use, by trying if he could raise three parts 
of their length by one corner without their bending; 
yet it appears, that if the cravat was not properly tied 
at the first effort, or inspiring impulse, it was always 
rejected : his valet was coming down stairs one day 
with a quantity of tumbled neckcloths under his arm, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 63 

and being interrogated on the subject, solemnly replied, 
" Oh, they are our failures." Practice like this of 
course made him perfect; and his tie soon became a 
model that was imitated, but never equalled. 

The method by which this most important result 
was attained, was communicated to me by a friend of 
his, who had frequently been an eye-witness of the 
amusing operation. 

The collar, which was always fixed to his shirt, 
was so large that, before being folded down, it com- 
pletely hid his head and face, and the white neckcloth 
was at least a foot in height. The first coup cCarchet 
was made with the shirt collar, which he folded down 
to its proper size; and Brummell then standing before 
the glass, with his chin poked up to the ceiling, by the 
gentle and gradual declension of his lower jaw, creased 
the cravat to reasonable dimensions, the form of each 
succeeding crease being perfected with the shirt which 
he had just discarded. 

His morning dress was similar to that of every 
other gentleman — Hessians and pantaloons, or top- 
boots and buckskins, with a blue coat, and a light or 
buff-coloured waistcoat; of course fitting to admiration, 
on the best figure in England. His dress of an even- 
ing was a blue coat and white waistcoat, black panta- 
loons which buttoned tight to the ankle, striped silk <s 
stockings, and opera-hat; in fact, he was always 
carefully dressed, but never the slave of fashion. 
Still he criticised severely the dress of others, more 
particularly when there was a want of neatness in it. 


64 THE LIFE OF 

A nobleman now living told me, that when he was a 
young man, Brummell not only noticed him a good 
deal, but from the way in which he patronised him, 
evidently appeared to think that he was doing him a 
great kindness. They were walking together arm-in- 
arm one day up St. James's Street, when Brummell 

suddenly stopped, and asked Lord what he 

called those things on his feet? " Why, shoes," he 
replied. " Shoes, are they? " said Brummell doubt- 
fully, and stooping to look at them, " I thought they 
were slippers." 

On another occasion, the Duke of Bedford asked 
him for an opinion on his new coat. Brummell exa- 
mined him from head to foot with as much attention 
as an adjutant of the Life Guards would the sentries 
on a drawing-room day. " Turn round," said the 
Beau : his Grace did so, and the examination was 
continued in front. When it was concluded Brummell 
stepped forward, and feeling the lappel delicately with 
his thumb and finger, said, in a most earnest and 
amusing manner, " Bedford, do you call this thing a 
coat? " The following reply to a question addressed 
to him by one amongst a knot of loungers at White's, 
was given in the same spirit of badinage. " Brummell, 
your brother William is in town; is he not coming 
here? " — " Yes, in a day or two; but I have recom- 
mended him to walk the back streets till his new 
clothes come home." 

Brummell's tailors were Schweitzer and Davidson, 
in Cork Street, Weston, and a German of the name of 


Duke of Bedford 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 65 

Meyer, who lived in Conduit Street. The Stultzes, 
Nugees, &c., did, I believe, exist in those days, 
but they were not then held in the same estimation as 
their more fortunate brethren of the shears. Schwe- 
itzer and Meyer worked for the Prince; and the latter 
had a page's livery, and on great occasions super- 
intended the adornment of His Royal Highness's 
person. The trouser, which opened at the bottom of 
the leg, and was closed by buttons and loops, was 
invented either by Meyer or Brummell : the Beau at 
any rate was the first who wore them, and they im- 
mediately became quite the fashion, and continued so 
for some years. 

A good-humoured baronet, and brother Etonian of 
his, who followed him at a humble distance in his 
dress, told me that he went to Schweitzer's one morn- 
ing to get properly rigged out, and that while this 
talented purveyor of habiliments was measuring him, 
he asked him what cloth he recommended? " Why, 
sir," said the artiste, " the Prince wears superfine, and 
Mr. Brummell the Bath coating; but it is immaterial 
which you choose, Sir John, you must be right; 
suppose, sir, we say Bath coating, — I think Mr. 
Brummell has a trifle the preference." 

Brummell's good taste in dress was not his least 
recommendation in the eyes of the Prince of Wales, 
by whom his advice on this important subject was 
constantly sought, and, for a long time, studiously 
followed. Mr. Thomas Raikes says, in his " France," ] 

1 "France since 1830," London, 1841, vol. ii. p. 377. 
VOL. I. E 


66 THE LIFE OF 

that His Royal Highness would go of a morning to 
Chesterfield Street to watch the progress of his 
friend's toilet, and remain till so late an hour that he 
sometimes sent away his horses, and insisted on 
Brummell's giving him a quiet dinner, which generally 
ended in a deep potation. 

After their quarrel, however, the Prince spoke of 
his former friend as a mere block, which a tailor 
might use with advantage to show off the particular 
cut of a coat; and this speech went some way to 
confirm the notion of the nonentity of Brummell's 
character. But there is good reason for asserting 
that an extravagant devotion to dress might, with 
far more justice, be charged against his royal patron; 
especially when corpulence, that sad annihilator of 
elegance, made it difficult for him to get into leathers 
of the dimensions he was anxious to wear. It was 
this that gave rise to the caricature in which a pair 
is represented lashed up between the bed-posts, and 
their owner, having been lifted into them, is seen 
struggling desperately to get his royal legs satis- 
factorily encased; leaving the imagination to pic- 
ture the horizontal hauling that must have taken 
place, after the perpendicular object had been effected, 
to make the waistband meet. 

In fact the Prince, not Brummell, was the Mecaenas 
of tailors; and perhaps no king of England ever 
devoted so much time to the details of his own dress, 
or devising alterations in that of his troops. On this 
point, whatever attention he gave to it, he displayed 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 67 

little judgment, as the chin of many a Life Guardsman 
in a windy day attested. The extent to which he 
indulged his passion for dress is seen in the proceeds 
of the sale of his wardrobe, which amounted to the 
enormous sum of fifteen thousand pounds; and if we 
are to judge by the price of a cloak purchased by 
Lord Chesterfield for two hundred and twenty, the 
sable lining alone having originally cost eight hundred, 
it is scarcely straining the point to suppose that this 
collection of royal garments had cost little less than one 
hundred thousand. A list of the articles was given 
in the Athenceum of the day, which, after expressing 
its astonishment at the prodigious accumulation of 
apparel, says, that "Wealth had done wonders, taste 
not much." 

But the best evidence that I can offer in support 
of the opinion that the word Beau ought not to be 
applied to Brummell in an offensive sense, is the 
following extract from a very kind and courteous 
letter which I received from the Rev. G. Crabbe, to 
whom I had written, having observed Brummell's 
name mentioned in his Life of his talented and 
amiable father. 

" I am sorry that I can give you no other infor- 
mation respecting the communication between Mr. 
Brummell and my father at Belvoir, than the short 
and trifling remark in the Memoir, as I never heard 
my father mention him except when he made that 
remark; but short as it was, it entirely accords with 
the impression which I believe was general in that 


68 THE LIFE OF 

neighbourhood, viz., that Mr. Brummell was a sensible 
man and a finished gentleman; the term ' Beau/ 
which the world has offered to him, might be more 
applicable perhaps in his earlier years; but when my 
father met him at Belvoir, he was, I conceive, about 
forty, and certainly did not, either in manners or 
appearance, exhibit that compound of coxcombry in 
dress, and vulgar assiduity of address, which marks 
the ' Beau ' (that is the dandy); I remember being 
struck with the misapplication of this title when I 
saw him one day in the Belvoir hunt. He was 
dressed as plain as any man in the field, and the 
manly, and even dignified, expression of his counten- 
ance ill accorded with the implication the sobriquet 
conveyed." And yet Jack Robinson, an acquaintance 
of his early life, observes — "Brummell's carriage was 
never at any time graceful; perfect gentleman as he 
was, there was something of a slang air about him." 
I have heard it stated that Sir Henry Mildmay made 
the same remark. I cannot, however, agree with 
either of them; he might have been ungraceful and 
have had something unusual in his manner in early 
life; but, when I knew him at Caen in his old age, 
Brummell was eminently graceful and distinguished- 
looking, and was considered so by French ladies, no 
mean judges.

THERE was, in fact, nothing extreme about Brummell's 
personal appearance but his extreme cleanliness and 
neatness, and whatever time and attention he devoted 
to his dress, the result was perfect; no perfumes, he 
used to say, but very fine linen, plenty of it, and 
country washing. With regard to perfumery, his 
taste perfectly coincided with that of the Champion 
of England. " I remember," says Lord Byron, in 
his letter on Bowies' Strictures on Pope, " (and do 
you remember, reader, that it was in my earliest 
youth, 'Consule Planco') — on the morning of the 
great battle (the second) between Gully and Gregson, 
— Cribb, who was matched against Horton, for the 
second fight, on the same memorable day awaking 
me (a lodger at the inn in the next room), by a loud

remonstrance to the waiter against the abomination of 
his towels, which had been laid in lavender ! " Mr. 
Leigh Hunt in a note, in which he kindly referred me 
to some anecdotes of Brummell, says, " I remember 
that Lord Byron once described him to me, as having 
nothing remarkable in his style of dress, except a 
'certain exquisite propriety/" — and that gentleman, 
in a sketch which he gave of the Beau at an early 
period of his life, observes, when speaking of his 
superior judgment on this point, " that the poet's 
hyperbole about the lady might be applied to his 
coat, ' You might almost say the body thought.' " —It 
did think; and, had Montesquieu known Brummell, 
he would never have said, " Le gout est un je ne 
sgais quoi." 

Cleanliness, however, rather than taste, was the 
touchstone upon which his acquaintances were inva- 
riably tried; to detect in them any deviation from 
that virtue, which has by common consent been 
placed next to godliness, was a sufficient reason for 
his declining any further intercourse with them. 
One of his friends, curious to know something of a 
family that he had passed a day with in the country, 
inquired of him, what sort of people they were : 
" Don't ask me, my good fellow," replied Brummell; 
"you may imagine, when I tell you, that I actually 

found a cobweb in my ! " The anecdote is, 

perhaps, true; and it was probably this that induced 
him to keep a travelling one, for one of these 
indispensable articles of bed-room furniture is de-

scribed in the catalogue of the sale of his effects as 
such, " in a folding mahogany case, with an external 
carpet case for the same." It is said, that he 
objected to country gentlemen being admitted to 
Watier's, assigning as a sufficient reason for their 
exclusion, that their boots stunk of horse-dung and 
bad blacking. If this had been true, many would 
have been of the same opinion, but his jocose remark 
was very probably made against some individual 
candidate. His objection to one of the prevailing 
tastes of his day — excessive devotion to stables, 
dog-kennels, and coachmanship — appears to have 
been strong; and he gives a proof of this by having 
taken the trouble to insert some very severe lines 
against the Whip-club in his album. 

But though ridicule, false or true, is often more 
keenly felt than just censure, the Squire Westerns 
must have been far more indignant with Mr. Pitt, 
who, after all the support they had given him, did 
in his convivial hours forget his official circum- 
spection and suffer his real opinion of them to 
escape him. A diplomatist of my acquaintance, now 
living, was present when the flattering expressions 
I allude to were uttered at Lord Mulgrave's table, 
that nobleman being, at the time, First Lord of 
the Admiralty. 

My gossip was then a young man, and the day on 
which he was so fortunate as to meet the Prime 
Minister at dinner, was remarkable for being the 
one on which the First Lord was to examine a boat, 


72 THE LIFE OF 

constructed by Sir Sidney Smith, in 1805, for the 
purpose of acting against the Boulogne flotilla. This 
vessel, which was in fact nothing more than two 
boats fastened together like those of the Pacific 
islanders, was navigated by the proper officers to 
Putney, and there, under the Admiral's orders, put 
through all the manoeuvres which could in any way 
explain her use and capabilities : she was called 
the Gemini, and as it was a subject of some 
importance, Mr. Pitt and a large party had been 
invited to Lord Mulgrave's, whose house was on 
the banks of the Thames, to see the trial. Accord- 
ingly before dinner they went on the lawn to see 
the boat, and afterwards returned to the house, 
where Sir Sidney having joined the party, which 
consisted of about twelve persons, they sat down to 
table : there was every prospect of the dinner being 
an agreeable one, and so it turned out; Mr. Pitt 
was in great spirits, and amused those near him 
exceedingly, conversing with them on a variety of 
subjects, politics apparently never entering his head, 
and he was no flincher at his wine. 

But after the cloth was removed the conversation 
became less general, and was carried on by two or 
three persons, who had each their little knot of lis- 
teners; one of the speakers being Colonel, afterwards 
Lord Dillon, who was holding forth on the good old 
times of Sir Robert Walpole, and the great utility 
of that noble class, the country gentlemen. " What's 
that you say, Colonel," said Pitt, "of the good old 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 73 

times? " The Colonel repeated his eulogium, finishing 
of course with a still more splendid peroration. 
" Ah," replied Pitt, in his deep sepulchral voice, " ah, 
Colonel Dillon, those were indeed the good old times, 
— for they were days when country gentlemen were 
even more ignorant and more obstinate than they 
are at present ! " 

" Imagine my astonishment, however," said the 
diplomatist, "on hearing Mr. Pitt in the House of 
Commons, two months after, when he had some tax 
which he was anxious to saddle upon these ' ignorant 
and obstinate gentlemen/ make the most laboured 
panegyric in their praise; and particularly addressing 
Colonel Stanley, the late Earl of Derby's uncle (for 
the House was in Committee at the time), instance 
him as or.e of the finest examples of this class ! " 

Brummell's great external characteristic was the 
elegance of his manners; they were the gift of 
nature, not the conventional ones usually acquired, 
in greater or less perfection, in the class of society 
that he frequented. There was no affectation or 
pretension about him; but if any peculiarity could 
be observed, it was a tinge of the graceful formality 
generally described as " of the old school." His 
carriage was noble, all his movements were gentle 
and dignified, but never gave the impression that 
they were studied; and his deportment was so pecu- 
liarly striking, that in walking down St. James's 
Street, he attracted the attention of the passers-by 
as much as the Prince of Wales himself. To ad- 


74 THE LIFE OF 

mire whatever was elegant was natural to him, 
and his living in the midst of every description of 
refinement, in palaces, or in mansions hardly, if in 
fact at all, inferior, fully accounts for the taste and 
judgment which he possessed in buhl, china, and 
other objects of virtu; he was very curious in snuff- 
boxes, and had a collection of great beauty and 
value : as also of canes. 

Here, however, panegyric on his judgment must 
stop; for it is doubtful whether his mind was so 
keenly alive to the sublime beauties of the Italian 
school of painting, or the sculpture of the ancients. 
His small library was stored with standard works, 
and though by no means comprising the extent of 
his reading, as he could at any time avail himself of 
superior ones, and constantly did so, showed the 
same good taste. 

Being thus habitually, as well as naturally, ele- 
gant and refined, he of course had an antipathy to 
vulgarity of any sort, especially in manners; but 
his sarcastic allusions to it were directed, generally 
speaking, against those whom he considered ought 
to have known better. 

But it would be difficult indeed to fix the precise 
standard of manners that constitutes the finished 
gentleman, and many and amusing are the dicta of 
some, who have undertaken to supply rules for the 
guidance of such as are anxious to excel in that 
rare and difficult character. Amongst the prohibitory 
ones is Lord Chesterfield's declaration that a gentle- 


Lord Petersham 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 75 

man ought not to play on the violin. Would it 
not have been more sensible had he said, a gentle- 
man ought not to take snuff? that most nasty opera- 
tion, the only deviation from the practice of personal 
purity in which Brummell indulged. Happily for 
the fair sex, it has long fallen into general disuse 
as a fashionable habit, which it was in his day. 
The Prince of Wales took snuff, a sufficient reason 
for the almost universal adoption of the custom. 
But even this Brummell did in an elegant manner, 
scarcely inferior to that of His Royal Highness : 
like him, he opened his box with peculiar grace, 
and with one hand only, the left. One of the great 
amateurs of this nasal pastime, and a friend of 
Brummell's, was Lord Petersham, whose cellar of 
snuff — not wine — was said by the tobacconists to be 
worth three thousand pounds.1 

But to return to the consideration of gentlemanly 
demeanour. A good many years ago, a friend of mine, 
a young clergyman, whose manners were peculiarly 
pleasing and correct, was out shooting, in Norfolk, 
with an elderly gentleman of his acquaintance. It was 
a "bright burning day in September, and they had 
walked over miles of stubble and turnips with pretty 

1 Lord Petersham, who afterwards became Earl of Harrington, was 
as choice in his selection of teas as he was in snuff and snuff-boxes, of 
which boxes it was said he had one for every day of the year. He 
was tall, and in his countenance resembled somewhat Henri IV. of 
France; he patronised tailors, and gave his name to a great-coat as well 
as to a particular snuff-mixture; he also cut his own clothes and made 
his own blacking. His horses, carriages, and the coats of his servants, 
were always of a brown colour. 


76 THE LIFE OF 

good success, when, stopping in the middle of a 
field for a momentary rest, the young clergyman 
took his handkerchief from his hat, and, passing it 
across his brow, said to his companion, " Oh ! how 
thirsty I am 1" — "What!" exclaimed the old sports- 
man in a tone of unfeigned surprise, " thirsty? a 
gentleman, young man, is never thirsty; " and, 
taking a dried camomile flower out of his pocket and 
placing it in his mouth, he shouldered his gun, re- 
commending my friend, as they renewed their walk, 
to carry a similar antidote with him in future. 

Such was the feeling of the " old school " with 
regard to propriety of manners, though, perhaps, a 
little exaggerated in this instance, and certainly in 
that of Lord Chesterfield; for with that nobleman it 
was a mere affectation of refinement, but with the 
old gentleman it was a real feeling of propriety. 

A ci-devant garde-du-corps of Charles the Tenth's, 
who formed one of the society of Caen when Brum- 
mell was residing in that town, was also an example 
of stoicism similar to that required of a gentleman 
by this venerable critic. He had only his half-pay, 
seven hundred and fifty francs a-year, and his ward- 
robe, as might naturally be expected, was rather 
deficient on such an income. It was little enough 
for a man who might be sans home, sans shirt, sans 
everything, — whose salon is the wretched cabaret 
at the corner of the street; but for a legitimist, sup- 
porting the character of a well-dressed man, and a 
ruined cause, it was positive starvation. Fortunately 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 77 

his affluent friends of the same political opinions 
sometimes assisted him with a coat, and occasionally 
with a pair of inexpressibles, or a dinner; but never 
did their friendly donations extend to a cloak or a 
great-coat, and in the most bitter weather, no matter 
whether it was sleeting or snowing, he was never 
seen in the street habited in anything of the kind. 

One keen winter afternoon, an Englishman, who 
was making his way to his dinner at the hotel as 
rapidly as he could, to his infinite amazement met 

Monsieur de Z with his surtout open, and 

looking the very emblem of the season. Boldly 
erect, however, with his hat on one side, he appeared 
to defy the elements, and stalked towards him as 
magnanimously insouciant as if he had been clad in 
sables. The Englishman, with his cloak thrown up 
to his very eyes, like a true Hidalgo, struck with 
the transparent appearance of the garde-du-corps, 
asked him, in a really compassionate tone, if he did 
not feel the cold? " Froid, monsieur ! " said the 
haughty Carlist, " un homme comme il faut n'a jamais 
froid." 

Though there may be two opinions as to whether 
it is necessary that a gentleman should never be 
either thirsty, or cold, or play the violin, few will 
deny that " the gentleman of the old school " is now 
a rara avis, and that, in doing away with the for- 
malities by which society was regulated in days gone 
by, we have lost much of the polish that distinguished 
him. Had the old sportsman, of whom I have been 

### Page 78

speaking, written The Adventures of a Gentleman,[1] 
he would scarcely have allowed his hero to set dogs 
to fight in a house, — in one, too, in which he was a 
perfect stranger ! 

May we not question whether society has gained 
by the extent to which the relaxation of its forms 
has been carried, though some was desirable? The 
intercourse between a father and his son had in the 
last generation much of formality in it; but the 
restrictions which then existed were useful, and 
tended strongly to preserve that consideration and 
respect which are too often broken through in the 
present day. In writing to his father, the son then 
addressed him as " My dear sir; " in conversation, 
" Sir." A complete upsetting, instead of the modi- 
fication of such forms as these, has not created a 
warmer affection between the two; while it has 
certainly given rise to a familiarity that frequently 
terminates in impertinence, and, finally, in a total 
want of filial respect. Many an under-graduate, or 
incipient field-marshal, in penning a letter home for 
a fresh supply of funds, now commences his epistle 
with " My dear Governor," who at his wine-party 
designates his father by the still more elegant de- 
nomination of the " old boy," or the " old cock." 
The use of such coarse language, in speaking of a 
parent, cannot fail in time to breed contempt; and, 
in truth, it does so. 

[1] "Pelham; or, The Adventures of a Gentleman," by the late Lord 
Lytton, was first published in the year 1827. 


BEAU BRV MM ELL. 79 

But manners, as well as dress, will of course vary, 
as they ever have done, with each succeeding gene- 
ration; a hoop did not make a lady, nor gold lace a 
gentleman; neither of these appendages is a loss, 
but the minuet contributed far more to make them 
elegant, than the gallopade; and Sir Roger de 
Coverley was a better style of Christmas revel, than 
the dance termed a Polonaise, into which is intro- 
duced a promenade through the bedrooms and down 
the corridors of our country mansions; on the walls 
of which the venerable ancestors of the family are 
shaking — yes, shaking with indignation at such hoy- 
denish proceedings. What would be the feelings of 
the youthful and stately beauties of preceding gene- 
rations— an J beauties they were, in spite of pearl- 
powder and pomatum — if they could be resuscitated, 
and (placed against a truncated column of gas sent 
from London, to light the ball-room) see their great 
grand-daughters dancing the Coquette, or some of 
the other cotillons? I venture to assert, that they 
would have no necessity for rouge that night. 

The comparative merits of different forms of govern- 
ment is a prolific subject of discussion, and none is 
more worthy of attention, or more deeply interesting; 
but it is astonishing how much opinions upon abstract 
principles are modified, by the influence which the 
manners and customs of different countries exercise 
upon them.

BRUMMELL'S manner and address, which made him so 
acceptable, and enabled him to take such a leading 
position in society, were not his only recommenda- 
tions; he was a charming companion, and was pos- 
sessed of the best of all claims to popularity — good 
humour. He drew well, and was not ignorant of 
music, and his voice was very agreeable in singing as 
well as speaking; he also wrote vers de socie'te, one of 
the accomplishments in vogue in his day, with facility, 
and his dancing was perfect. 

Though these qualifications, and the quiet unassum- 
ing manner which distinguished him, were more likely 
to make him a favourite with the fair sex than his 
own, he was as much liked by the men, and became 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 81 

most intimate at a very early period of his life with 
some of the first families in the country; the intervals 
between his seasons in London being varied by visits 
to the Prince at Brighton, or to Belvoir, Chatsworth, 
Woburn, &c. &c. Nevertheless the following note 
will show that he positively was once in town during 
the month of November1; but his friend Beauvais was 
probably an emigre, and he was good-naturedly show- 
ing him the lions. 

" Woburn Abbey, November 10. 

" MY DEAR BRUMMELL, — By some accident, which I 
am unable to account for, your letter of Wednesday 
did not reach me till yesterday. I make it a rule 
never to knd my box, but you have the entree libre 
whenever you wish to go there, as I informed the 
box-keeper last year. 

" I hope Beauvais and you will do great execution 
at Up-Park.1 I shall probably be there shortly after 
you. — Ever yours sincerely, 

" BEDFORD." 

At Belvoir he was fami de la famille, and at Cheve- 
ley, another seat of the Duke of Rutland's, his rooms 
were as sacred as the Duke of York's, who was a 
frequent visitor there; and if any gentleman happened 
to be occupying them when he arrived unexpectedly, 
he was obliged to turn out. 

On the Duke of Rutland's coming of age, in January 

1 The seat of Sir Henry Featherstonhaugh, Bart. 
VOL. I. F 


8a THE LIFE OF 

1799, great rejoicings took place at Belvoir, and 
Brummell was one of the distinguished party that 
assembled there, amongst whom were the Prince of 
Wales, the late Duke of Argyle, his eldest son the 
Marquis of Lome, the sixth Lord Jersey, &c., and all 
the neighbouring gentry. 

The festivities on this occasion lasted for three 
weeks, and were conducted on a truly ducal scale. 
Fireworks of the most splendid description were let 
off in front of the Castle, one bullock was roasted 
whole on the bowling-green of the quadrangle, and 
another at the bottom of the hill on which the noble 
pile of building stands; but such was the severity of 
the weather, that while one side was roasting the 
other was freezing. This, however, did not deter the 
peasantry from making their way in hundreds to the 
Duke's kitchen and servants' hall, where the table 
groaned with substantial fare, and the " brown October" 
was not only " drunk on the premises," but carried 
away in pailsful. This unrivalled example of baronial 
magnificence and hospitality is still remembered in the 
vale of Belvoir; a circumstance not very extraordinary, 
for this proof of the warmth and generosity of the 
young and noble duke's disposition is said to have 
cost him sixty thousand pounds. 

The weather being severe, there was of course no 
hunting, so skating was the order of the day; and 
Brummell, in going down the hill to the ice, clad in 
a pelisse of fur, was one morning mistaken by the 
people, who had assembled in great numbers, for the 


Duke of 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 83 

Prince of Wales, and was loudly cheered. This little 
incident will give some idea of the elegance and 
dignity of his carriage. It was indeed nearly as 
remarkable as that of His Royal Highness, who, in 
spite of the opinion retailed by a modern novelist, that 
" in the zenith of his popularity and personal advan- 
tages, he seemed positively vulgar by the side of the 
Count d'Artois," was allowed by his greatest enemies 
to be the most distinguished-looking man of his 
day. 

Though I had the preceding anecdote from the 
very best authority, I did not hear whether Brummell, 
when he arrived at the ice, " made a star " upon it, or 
rivalled the former Marquis of Lome, a perfect skater, 
by engraving his cipher. Certain it is that he hated 
personal exertion in any way, and it was difficult to 
make him give up his book and shoulder his gun, to 
join in a scramble over hedgerows and ditches. He 
was not much of a shot, and looked upon a battue 
only as an excellent opportunity for letting off his 
fun. 

In those primeval days, there was no such thing as 
patent wadding; and punched cards, if known, were 
not general; at any rate he did not choose to adopt 
them, and used to excite a laugh among the sportsmen 
by appearing at the breakfast table with fifty or sixty 
pieces of paper like spills, attached with a large whistle 
to the button-hole of his jacket. 

One of his greatest feats with his gun, was perpe- 
trated at Cheveley, where he had just returned from a 


84 THE LIFE OF 

grand day, on which three hundred head of game had 
been slaughtered : the rest of the party were contem- 
plating the fruit of their success, as it lay upon the 
lawn; but Brummell, who took little interest in the 
deceased, having accidentally caught sight of two tame 
pigeons which had lovingly perched upon one of the 
chimnies, tempted by a standing shot, carefully raised 
his gun, and brought them both down. His satisfac- 
tion, however, was very transient, for a general excla- 
mation from the bystanders followed, and he soon learnt 
they were the pets of one of the upper servants; great 
was then his regret, and many the apologies he made 
to the owner. But this unfortunate chance was not quite 
so serious in its results as that of the Duke of York, 
who, while shooting at Cheveley, during a Newmarket 
October Meeting, mistook a favourite liver-coloured 
pointer of the Duke's for a hare, and shot her dead. 
Poor Venus was a beautiful bitch, one of the finest 
dogs in the kingdom, and His Royal Highness was 
even more hurt than his friend, who valued her very 
highly. 

Though Brummell was so much at Belvoir, and kept 
a stud of horses there, he was never a " Melton 
man; " and his friends, as well as every one else, were 
amazingly astonished when he joined in the pleasures 
of the chase; for, like many other gentlemen, he did 
not like it; it did not suit his habits, and his servant 
could never get him up in time to join the hounds, if it 
was a distant meet : but even if the meet was near, 
and they found quickly, he only rode a few fields, and 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 85 

then shaped his course in an opposite direction, or 
paid a visit to the nearest farm-house, to satisfy 
his enormous appetite for bread and cheese. I have 
heard him, but many years after, laugh amazingly over 
these incidents of his Melton days, and say in his 
usual droll way, that he " could not bear to have his 
tops and leathers splashed by the greasy galloping 
farmers." 

The truth was, he preferred returning at two o'clock 
to lunch with the Duchess and her female guests : he 
was to them a most sociable, cheerful, and amusing 
companion; and yet very much liked by the fox- 
hunters, farmers as well as gentlemen, for he had 
always a merry word to say to them, and the late Mr. 
Apperley assured me, that when he chose to ride, he 
rode respectably : but he did not say that he ever 
heard of his having been in at the death, after the 
famous run from Billesden Coplow, immortalised in 
verse by a clergyman, the son of a bishop : neither 
did he say, that he ever rode, like Tom Smith, at a 
Croxton Park paling, with a hurdle on the top of it. 
It was on this occasion that Mr. Smith, being taken 
up half-stunned, and asked what on earth could tempt 
him to go at a fence impossible to clear? replied, " I 
had a lead, and if I had not gone at it somebody else 
might have tried." 

But, many years after this period, when, at Caen, 
Brummell used sometimes to revert to the pleasurable 
recollections of times past, he once spoke of an 
occasion on which he was obliged to exercise his best 


86 THE LIFE OF 

powers across country; and the anecdote, as it was 
repeated to me, was so amusing, that though I cannot 
authenticate the fact on which it depends, I cannot 
refrain from inserting it. 

It appears that after he retired from the Tenth, 
he was tempted to accept a majority in the Belvoir 
Volunteers, raised by the Duke of Rutland after the 
short peace of 1803, and that while he was in this 
responsible and complimentary situation, a General 
Officer was sent down by the Horse Guards to inspect 
the corps : the official notifications had been given and 
received, the time and place named, and General Binks 
(for such shall be his incognito) arrived punctual to the 
minute. The men were there, the officers also; the 
drums and colours, — not a halberd was missing, — but 
Major Brummell, — where was he at this critical junc- 
ture? nobody knew. 

The indignant regular waited and waited, the 
charger snorted, the General snorted, and at length, 
both being equally exasperated at the unreasonable 
delay, the gallant officer commenced the performance 
of his now unpleasant duty; this was terminating, of 
course not much to his satisfaction, when the truant 
Major was descried in a scarlet coat in the distance, 
coming at speed across the country, occasionally craning 
on his way, and then with renewed energy making 
play over the flat. A few minutes, and the Beau was 
cap in hand to General Binks, who suddenly halted 
the line, which then much resembled that formed by 
a patriotic Volunteer corps, when reviewed in the 


BEAU BRUMMELL. «7 

Phoenix Park, and for the serpentine character of 
which, their learned commander so drolly apologised to 
the Lord Lieutenant, by saying, " Your Excellency, 
we are Lawyers, as this indenture witnesseth." But 
in this case, the commanding officer had to make an 
apology for himself, not for his corps, and he entered 
upon a series of explanatory speeches commencing 
with, Having left Belvoir quite early, — fully thought 
he should have been home in time, for the meet was 
close at hand, but the favourite horse failed and landed 
him in a ditch, — was dreadfully shook, and had been 
lying there an hour, — which the state of his pink 
amply testified. 

Excuses, however, were vain; General Binks was 
a martinet enrage : he remained inexorable, and raising 
himself in his stirrups, addressed the delinquent in the 
following pompous and inflated style : " Sir, this con- 
duct is wholly inexcusable; if I remember right, sir, 
you once had the honour of holding a Captain's com- 
mission under His Royal Highness the Prince of 
Wales, the heir-apparent, himself, sir ! Now, sir, I 
tell you, I tell you, sir, that I should be wanting 
in a proper zeal for the honour of the service; I 
should be wanting in my duty, sir, if I did not, 
this very evening, report this disgraceful neglect of 
orders to the Commander-in-Chief, as well as the 
state in which you present yourself in front of your 
regiment : and this shall be done, sir. You may 
retire, sir." 

The Beau bowed low and in silence, and did retire; 


88 THE LIFE OF 

but he had scarcely walked his horse five paces from 
the spot, when he returned and said in a subdued 
tone, " Excuse me, General Binks, but in my anxiety 
to explain this most unfortunate business, I forgot to 
deliver a message which the Duke of Rutland desired 
me to give you when I left Belvoir this morning : it 
was to request the honour of your company at dinner." 
It would be difficult to say which gave the oddest 
grin, the culprit or the disciplinarian; the latter 
coughed, and at length cleared his throat sufficiently 
to express his thanks in these words : " Ah : why, 
really I feel, and am, very much obliged to his Grace; 
pray, Major Brummell, tell the Duke, I shall be most 
happy; and," — melodiously raising his voice, for the 
Beau had already turned his horse once more towards 
Belvoir, " Major Brummell, as to this little affair, I am 
sure, no man can regret it more than you do. Assure 
his Grace, that I shall have great pleasure in accepting 
his very kind invitation." And they parted, amidst a 
shower of smiles. 

But Brummell was as yet only half out of his diffi- 
culties; the invitation he had so readily given to the 
General was coined on the spot, was his own inven- 
tion, to save himself from the consequences of his 
neglect of duty, and he had to ride for his life to the 
Castle to prepare his friend the Duke for an unexpected 
visitor, the distinguished Binks. This anecdote does 
not tell well on paper, but let the reader imagine 
Brummell giving his own account of the scene, taking 
off the graceful and submissive bow with which he 


### Page 89 

acknowledged the reproof, and the arch twist of his 
eyebrows as he described himself giving the invitation, 
that acted as such an efficient anodyne to the General's 
indignation. 

Another anecdote is also related of the Beau 
at Belvoir Castle. In a certain part of this noble 
seat is a large hall round which runs a gallery that 
communicates with the sleeping apartments. In 
this corridor is suspended the rope of the great bell 
used only in case of fire. It appears, however, that 
one night about half an hour after Brummell and a 
numerous company had retired to their rooms, the iron 
tongue of this giant communicator was heard speaking 
in no very gentle tones to the inmates of the castle, 
and those in the houses of the neighbourhood. The 
effect upon the household, as may be readily imagined, 
was electrical, and in a very few seconds after the first 
note had been struck, the hall was crowded with 
masters, mistresses, and servants in every variety of 
male and female nocturnal costume. No symptom of 
fire could, however, be detected, and they were wonder- 
ing what could have induced any one to toll the bell, 
when the Beau came forward to the edge of the 
gallery, and said with one of his most placid smiles : 
" Really, my good people, I regret having disturbed you, 
but the fact is my valet forgot to bring my hot water." 

Brummell always appeared at the coverside admir- 
ably dressed, in a white cravat and white tops, which 
latter, either he or Robinson, his valet, introduced, 
and which eventually superseded the brown ones; his

horses were always in as high condition as himself, 
their coats looking like silk. They stood at the 
Peacock at the bottom of the hill, near Belvoir, and 
were under the care of a person of the name of Fryatt, 
who perfectly understood his business; indeed he was 
more an agent than a groom, for he purchased, when 
and what he thought proper, without much, if ever, 
consulting his master, who had too much sense to 
interfere with him. 

The truth was, Fryatt was an excellent rider, a 
capital judge of horses, and sometimes put money into 
Brummell's pocket, besides mounting him well; he 
also took care of himself, and at his death left eight or 
ten thousand pounds behind him, made out of horse- 
flesh : the inn which he kept at Melton for one or two 
years, was not so profitable a concern. After a few 
seasons, Brummell's stud was removed to Knipton, on 
account of some misunderstanding with Shipton, the 
landlord of the Peacock; in 1807, his horses stood at 
Grantham. 

Knipton is a very beautiful village about a mile and 
a half from Belvoir Castle, and near it is a lake, of 
two hundred acres in extent; the spot is richly wooded, 
and the late Duchess took great pains to improve it, 
particularly in the drives, which are laid out with much 
judgment; the Castle, also, will long remain a magni- 
ficent memorial of her architectural taste, for the plan 
of it was her own selection. Her love of landscape- 
gardening probably originated in her talent for draw- 
ing, which was considerable, as the collection at 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 91 

Belvoir of her own doing affords ample and pleasing 
evidence. Brummell's capability of appreciating this 
accomplishment, and his own proficiency in it, com- 
bined with his other acquirements, and his indifference 
to field-sports, naturally made him a very welcome 
guest in the drawing-room at Belvoir, and led to 
greater intimacy with his noble hostess than he might 
otherwise have aspired to. 

He appears to have taken a pleasure in applying 
his talent for drawing, to the not unamiable object of 
preserving the memory of some of the distinguished 
women, that he was fortunate enough to be able to 
number among his friends. These sketches are from 
miniatures or pictures. One, of Georgiana, Duchess 
of Devonshire, was taken from a portrait by Sir 
Joshua Reynolds, and is now, or was, in the posses- 
sion of Lady Granville; two others, those of the late 
Duchesses of Beaufort and Rutland, are now in the 
author's hands. The former is in water-colours, the 
latter in pencil : though not highly finished, both are 
very creditably executed for an amateur. 

In a letter of Brummell's, subsequently given, 
written many years after the death of the Duchess 
of Rutland, he feelingly alludes to her in terms that 
would confirm the most delightful impression of her 
disposition. But, however the society in which she 
moved might have regretted her Grace's premature 
death, inasmuch as it removed one of the brightest 
and most fascinating ornaments from their gay circle, 
yet her loss was far more sincerely deplored by the 


92 THE LIFE OF 

poorer classes of her own neighbourhood, in whose 
welfare and happiness she had always manifested a 
most lively interest, and who assembled in vast crowds 
at her funeral, to pay the last tribute of a sincere 
respect to their benefactress. 

In concluding this chapter, the principal part of 
which relates to Brummell's intimacy with a family in 
which he for many years passed much of his time, it 
may not be altogether uninteresting to mention some 
of the guests with whom he was frequently associated, 
and with the majority of whom, now like himself in 
their graves, he was on the most friendly footing; as 
it will give the reader an idea how deeply he must 
have felt the alteration in his circumstances, and the 
change he had to encounter in society, during his long 
and compulsory residence abroad — from Belvoir to 
Calais ! Amongst these were the Dukes of York and 
Cambridge; the Dukes of Beaufort, Manchester, 
Dorset, and Argyle; the Earls of Westmoreland and 
Chatham (William Pitt's brother, and the great 
friend of the Duke of Rutland on the turf); the 
Lords Delamere, Apsley, Forester, F. Bentinck, and 
Robert Manners; the Honourables W. Howard, Irby, 
and Henry Pierrepoint (Lord Manvers's brother, and 
one of the leaders at Watier's); Chig Chester (a 
great whist-player, sportsman, and good fellow); Sir 
Watkin Wynne, Sir John Thoroton; Colonel F., 
and the Rev. P. Thoroton; Colonel G. Cornwall, 
Parson Grosvenor, Mr. Delme" Ratcliffe, and John 
Douglas. 


Lord Manners.

There were also present, Lords Jersey, Alvanley, 
Willoughby d'Eresby, and Charles Manners; who, as 
well as Lord Robert, was with Brummell in the Tenth. 
A few commoners were likewise there; namely, Richard 
Norman, the Duke of Rutland's brother-in-law, Culling 
Smith, Sloane Stanley, General Grosvenor, and General 
Upton.

BRUMMELL'S intimacy with the Prince of Wales, and also with so many families of distinction, in addition to his social qualifications and perfect manners, soon made him sought and courted in society, and he was at length the vogue — no party was complete without him; and the morning papers, in giving the details of a rout, always placed his name first on the list of untitled guests. But his ambition was, not only to shine in the fashionable world, but to be its dictator, 
and, to effect this object, he saw that he must be 
formidable; like Sylla, he must be feared. A quick 
perception of the folly and gullibility of many of its 
members, enabled him to shape his course accordingly; 
and, being fully aware of the power of ridicule, and 
not inconvenienced by any undue proportion of feeling 
for the crowd, he used it freely. His disposition to 
satirise was, no doubt, unamiable; but there was an 
essential difference between exercising his sarcastic 


### Page 95

vein upon people who were perfectly indifferent to him, and making an ill-natured use of it in private circles. In cutting up individuals with whom he had no feelings in common, which was pretty often the case, he did no more than hundreds of others; but, having a most perfect tact in all matters appertaining to mien and conduct in society, he made the witty, satirical, and cynical points of his character tell with much more effect than they did theirs.

How well he eventually succeeded in making his opinion valued or dreaded, the following anecdote will give an idea.

"Do you see that gentleman near the door?" said an experienced chaperon to her daughter, whom she had brought, for the first time, into the arena of Almack's, "he is now speaking to Lord ——."

"Yes, I see him," replied the light-hearted, and as yet unsophisticated girl;

"Who is he?"

"A person, my dear, who will probably come and speak to us; and if he enters into conversation, be careful to give him a favourable impression of you, for," and she sunk her voice to a whisper, "he is the celebrated Mr. Brummell."

This is no fiction; the young Lady Louisa was the daughter of a duke, and her rank, wealth, and personal attractions might well have been thought sufficient to secure her against the criticisms of any man. This doubtless was her mother's opinion; but such was Brummell's influence, and such his supposed ill-nature in the use of his powers of detraction, that she was obliged to warn her young débutante not unthinkingly to expose herself to them.

### Page 96

It has been asserted that even Madame de Staël was haunted by a dread of his disapprobation, and that she considered her having failed to please him, as the greatest *malheur* that she experienced during her residence in London; the next—that the Prince of Wales did not call upon her.

The following is an extract from the Aurora Borealis of periodicals, which proves that it also acknowledged the existence of his extraordinary influence:

> Every one has heard the story of the man who, when Pitt inquired what could be done to forward his interest, simply requested the Prime Minister to bow to him in public.
> There was some sense and knowledge of the world in this request;
> nor was it altogether an unmeaning affectation in Brummell when, in reply to a nobleman of the highest rank, who accused him of inveigling his son into a disreputable gambling transaction, he exclaimed, 'Really I did my best for the young man: I once gave him my arm all the way from White's to Watier's.'[1]

Brummell was so far right; for had the young man possessed any sense, and profited by his example, he would at least have gamed amongst gentlemen; and in losing his money would not have lost caste also, as it is to be presumed the transaction occurred at some low hell, and not at either of these clubs: unless indeed the opinion of the commentator on Lord Byron’s works is correct, namely, "that a 'hell' is a gaming-house so called, where you risk

little and are cheated a good deal, and a ' club ' a 
pleasant purgatory, where you lose more, and are not 
supposed to be cheated at all.' " 

Mr. Benson Hill, in his "A Pinch of Snuff/'1 likewise 
relates the following anecdote, as a proof that Brum- 
mell's opinion was above appeal in the world of 
fashion; it shows also that he turned his power to 
some account : " Fribourg and Treyer had received 
an anxiously expected supply of the veritable 
Martinique — the list of applicants for this highly 
prized article had long been filled up. The hogs- 
head was opened in the presence of the Arbiter, 
who, after taking a few pinches, gravely pronounced 
it ' a detestable compound, and not at all the style of 
thing that any man, with the slightest pretensions 
to correct taste, could possibly patronise.' This 
astounding announcement, which must soon spread 
among the candidates, petrified the purveyors : they 
had procured the snuff at a heavy outlay, and it was 
now likely to remain on their hands. The compan- 
ions of the Dictator left him to discuss the matter with 
the proprietors; no sooner were they gone than 
Brummell said, — ' By some oversight I did not put my 
name down on your Martinique list, and I must have 
allowed the thing to be dispensed to others, who 
know not its value as I do. Since the hogshead has 
been condemned, you will not object to my having 
three jars full of it : that fact once known, there is

little doubt that the remainder will find a speedy 
demand.' 

" The Messrs. Fribourg gladly yielded to the ruse of 
the exquisite, and in a few days it having become known 
that he had absolutely bought, and positively paid for, 
the quantity above-named, not a grain was left." 

But many were the steps by which Brummell 
arrived at this culminating point, and incalculable 
pains did he devote to his object before his opinion 
weighed with the elite of Almacks — before he could 
arrogate to himself the power of assigning the limits 
of gentility, and deciding who were " bon ou ntauvais 
ton/" before he dared to permit himself to exercise 
his wit at the cost of an insult to his future sove- 
reign, even though they had quarrelled — an insult 
that he would never, under any circumstances, have 
addressed to an equal. The recollection of the 
anecdote to which I allude leads me to the con- 
sideration of another feature in Brummell's char- 
acter, and one which mainly assisted him in attain- 
ing his singular eminence : I mean his indescribable 
assurance, which, without scandalising his memory, 
was not trifling. 

" No one," says the author of " Granby," " could 
talk down his superiors, whether in rank or talent, 
with more imposing confidence than Trebeck could; 
his denunciations were always couched in a witty 
form; and when it was needless or dangerous to 
define a fault, he could check applause with an 
incredulous smile, or depress pretension by the 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 99 

raising of an eyebrow. He observed, with derision, 
how those who were delighted and amused, vainly 
thought themselves confidentially treated, and exulted 
in the mistaken idea of being exempted from his 
cutting criticisms. No keeper of a menagerie could 
better show off a monkey than he did an original : 
on these occasions he always contrived to make the 
unconscious object of his experiments place his ab- 
surdities in the best point of view, concealing his 
own intentions under the blandest cajolery. 

" In the art of cutting he shone unrivalled; he 
knew the ' when/ and the ' where/ and the ' how : ' 
without affecting useless short-sightedness, he could 
assume that calm, but wandering gaze, which veers 
as if unconsciously around the proscribed individual, 
neither fixing nor being fixed; that indefinable look 
which excuses you, perhaps, to the person cut, and at 
any rate prevents him from accosting you." 

In searching for materials for this work, I hap- 
pened one day to stumble, and as I thought, very 
fortunately, upon a duodecimo volume, entitled " Anec- 
dotes of Impudence." Here, thought I, something 
is surely to be gleaned; but I was disappointed, 
and not only that, but surprised, for there was not 
a word about Brummell in the book; and the 
frontispiece, which on the impulse of the moment 
I hoped was a portrait of the Beau, proved to be 
one of the late Joseph Hume, Esq., M.P. Why Mr. 
Hume was selected by the author as the best type 
of the impudence of our times, it is not for me to 


loo THE LIFE OF 

say; but I think few will deny that it was very hard 
upon poor Brummell. 

Cool and impertinent, indeed, were the speeches 
that he often made, and the tricks that he played, 
especially if he had been affronted, or in self-defence : 
and then, whether his impudent remarks were levelled 
at a shoeblack or the Prince of Wales, was perfectly 
immaterial to him; for, however unjustifiable his 
jokes might sometimes be, at least he was never a 
court sycophant or a parasite. His sarcasms were 
generally launched at those moving in the same 
society as himself, at toadies, and rich and assuming 
parvenus who were endeavouring to force themselves 
into notice; not at people whose habits were unob- 
trusive, or who belonged to a more retired sphere of 
life. But the following well-known anecdote is the 
most inexcusable instance of his wanton impudence; 
for the person whom he made his butt had given 
him no just cause of offence; moreover, she was a 
woman. 

It appears that there were two dashing ladies fn 
London, whose patronymics were similar, and who 
gave great parties. One of them, a Mrs. Thompson, 
residing in the neighbourhood of Grosvenor Square; 
the other, a Mrs. Johnson, living near Finsbury 
Square. It appears, too, that sometime after Brum- 
mell's quarrel with the Prince of Wales, the former 
lady gave a splendid ball, at which His Royal Highness had signified his intention of being present; it is therefore scarcely necessary to add, that Brummell 


### Page 101 

was not included in the list of invitations. On the 
evening of the entertainment, however, while Mrs. 
Thompson was waiting in her ante-room, supported 
by a bevy of intimate friends, in momentary expecta- 
tion of the arrival of her royal guest, and exulting in 
the completeness of all her preparations — the Beau, 
to her ineffable surprise and disgust, made his 
appearance, and his best bow. Justly indignant 
at this outrage, she informed him, with as much 
coolness as she could command, that he was not 
Invited. " Not invited, Madam ! not invited ! " said 
Brummell, in his blandest tones, " surely there must 
be some mistake," and leisurely feeling in all his 
pockets to prolong the chance of the Prince's arrival, 
and therefore her misery, he at last drew forth an 
invitation card, and presented it to the incensed lady. 
She took it, and saw at a glance it was not her own 
card, but that of her rival in the East, and haughtily 
throwing it from her, in a climax of vexation and 
anxiety to get rid of him, said, " That card, sir, is a 
Mrs. Johnson's; my name is Thompson." " Is it, 
indeed? " replied Brummell, perfectly cool, and affect- 
ing the most innocent surprise, " Dear me, how very 
unfortunate ! — really, Mrs. Johns — Thompson, I mean, 
I am very sorry for this mistake; but you know, 
Johnson and Thompson — and Thompson and John- 
son, are really so much the same kind of thing. — 
Mrs. Thompson, I wish you a very good evening; " 
and making a profound bow, he slowly retired from 
the room amidst the suppressed anger of the bevy of 


102 THE LIFE OF 

intimates, the titter of his own friends, and the 
undisguised wrath of the lady. 

Though Brummell cultivated much the society of 
women, and his deference to those with whom he 
associated on intimate terms was great, he had not 
any very sincere respect for the sex, as the impertinent 
manner in which he so ill-naturedly harassed this 
poor lady evidently shows. On that point, as on all 
others of substantial merit, he was immeasurably 
below his justly admired contemporary, Wyndham. 
Brummell's refinement of manners could stand no 
comparison with his refinement of feeling, and sensi- 
tive delicacy towards women, of which the following 
is a most striking instance : — He was once dining in 
the country, at the house of a very wealthy but not 
very polished acquaintance, when the conversation 
happening to turn upon the subject of female beauty, 
the gentleman in the course of the discussion said, 
" But, Mr. Wyndham, what do you think of my wife's 
eyes? " " Sir," replied the disgusted Crichton, " I 

never took the liberty of looking at Mrs. F 's 

eyes." " Haven't you? well then, take her to the 
window," said the vulgar hound, quite misunderstand- 
ing the reproof, and much in the same tone as, had 
he been in his farmyard, he would have desired his 
visitor to examine a favourite Alderney. 

The anecdote of Mrs. Johnson-Thompson is no 
novelty, it has been worn threadbare, but it is, I 
believe, perfectly authentic, and like some others of 
the same nature, which may or may not be so, ought 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 103 

not to be omitted in a chapter upon his impudent 
facetiae. It is said, that on one occasion when Brum- 
mell was dining at a gentleman's house in Hampshire, 
where the champagne was very far from being good, 
he waited for a pause in the conversation, and then 
condemned it by raising his glass, and saying loud 
enough to be heard by every one at the table, "John, 
give me some more of that cider." 

But although guilty of impertinences of this kind, 
he was seldom premeditatedly ill-natured or ill- 
tempered, and, amongst his own set, his impudence 
was not only permitted, but expected; and no one 
thought of noticing it any more than they would have 
done that of a court jester. The following are cases 
in point : — " Brummell, you were not here yesterday," 
said one of his club friends; " where did you dine? " 

" Dine ! why with a person of the name of R s. 

I believe he wishes me to notice him, hence the 
dinner; but, to give him his due, he desired that I 
would make up the party myself, so I asked Alvanley, 
Mills, Pierrepoint, and a few others, and I assure you, 
the affair turned out quite unique; there was every 
delicacy in or out of season; the Sillery was perfect, 
and not a wish remained ungratified; but, my dear 
fellow, conceive my astonishment when I tell you, 

that Mr. R s had the assurance to sit down, and 

dine with us ! " 

On another occasion, a wealthy young gentleman 
then commencing life, and who afterwards became a 
member for an eastern borough, being very anxious 


104 THE L1FE OF 

to be well placed in Brummell's world, asked him and 
a large party to dine; the Beau went, and a few 
minutes before they separated, he, addressing the 
company, requested to know, who was to have the 
honour of taking him to Lady Jersey's that evening? 
" I will," said his host, delighted at the prospect of 
being seen to enter her ladyship's drawing-room in 
his company; " wait till my guests are gone, and my 
carriage is quite at your service." " Thank you ex- 
ceedingly," replied Brummell, pretending to take the 
offer in a literal sense, " very kind of you, indeed ! 

But D k," and he assumed an air of great gravity, 

" pray how are you to go? you surely would not like 
to get up behind? No, that would not be right, and 
yet it will scarcely do for me to be seen in the same 
carriage with you." There was an involuntary roar 

from all present, in which Mr. D k, with great 

good-nature, joined heartily. 

But Brummell could not always procure a cast in a 
friend's carriage, particularly if the friend had to call 
for him; and one night being disappointed of a chance 
that he had calculated upon, when it was too late to 
send for a glass coach, he was unwillingly obliged to 
despatch his servant to the nearest stand, with many 
injunctions as to the selection he should make. In a 
few minutes, No. 1803 was at his door, and soon after 
Brummell, who had alighted a little distance from the 
house, found himself ascending Lady Dungannon's 
staircase; he had in fact reached the summit, and 
was on the eve of entering her splendid drawing- 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 105 

room already filled with guests, when a servant touched 
him gently on the arm, and to his horror and amaze- 
ment, for he thought he had effected his purpose 
undiscovered, said, " Beg pardon, sir, perhaps you 
are not aware of it, but there is a straw in your shoe." 

While we have Brummell's name in connexion with 
hackney coaches, it may not be mal-a-propos to intro- 
duce a rather amusing puff, which was inserted some 
years ago in a weekly paper, by a man who wished 
to recommend a patent carriage step. To effect his 
object, he calls the Beau's influence to aid his man- 
oeuvre, and gives a very glowing description of his 
locomotive comforts, not a little in contrast with the 
preceding anecdote. The article commences with the 
following axiom : — 

" ' There is an art in everything, and whatever 
is worthy of being learnt, cannot be unworthy of 
a teacher.1 Such was the logical argument of the 
professor of the Art of Stepping in and out of a 
Carriage, who represented himself as much patronised 
by the sublime Beau Brummell, whose deprecation of 
those horrid coach steps he would repeat with great 
delight. ' Mr. Brummell,' he used to say, 'considered 
the sedan was the only vehicle for a gentleman, it 
having no steps; — and he invariably had his own 
chair, which was lined with white satin quilted, had 
down squabs, and a white sheepskin rug at the 
bottom, brought to the door of his dressing-room, 
on that account, always on the ground floor,' from 
whence it was transferred with its owner to the foot 


106 THE LIFE OP 

of the staircase of the house that he condescended to 
visit. Mr. Brummell has told me, continued the 
professor, that to enter a coach was torture to him. 
' Conceive,' said he, ' the horror of sitting in a car- 
riage with an iron apparatus, afflicted with the dread- 
ful thought, the cruel apprehension, of having one's 
leg crushed by the machinery ! Why are not the 
steps made to fold outside? The only detraction 
from the luxury of a vis-a-vis, is the double distress ! 
for both legs — excruciating idea ! ' '

IN the commencement of the last chapter I alluded 
to the tricks that Brummell played, meaning thereby 
practical jokes, — a species of frolic highly amusing to 
the bystanders, until it is their turn to suffer, — and 
in which he excelled. His predecessor, George 
Selwyn, and his contemporary, Sheridan, who loved 
one another as cordially as wits generally do, were 
also adepts in puerilities of this kind. Mr. Moore, 
in his Life of Sheridan, says that he once induced 
Tickell to run after him into a dark passage, which 
he had covered with plates, having, however, taken 
good care to leave a path for himself. Tickell was 
much cut; but, when Lord John Townshend came 
to condole with him, after a little show of indignation 
against his friend, he could not help exclaiming, 
" But how amazingly well it was done ! " Drum- 


io8 THE LIFE OP 

mell's jokes in this way were well done also; and, 
as is frequently the case, were practised upon those 
who could not retaliate. 

In one instance his victim was an old tmigrt, 
whom he met on a visit at Woburn or Chatsworth, 
into whose powder he managed, in concert with a 
certain noble friend, to introduce some finely-powdered 
sugar; and the next morning Monsieur le Marquis, 
in perfect ignorance of the trick, after having been 
" bien sucre," descended as usual to the breakfast- 
table. He had, however, scarcely made his bow, 
and inserted his knife into the Perigord-pie before 
him, when the flies (for the heat was extreme) 
already attracted to the table by the marmalade and 
honeycomb, began to transfer their attentions to his 
head; and before the segment of pie was finally 
detached, every fly at the table had settled on it. 
The carving-knife was relinquished, to drive them 
away with his pocket-handkerchief, but the attempt 
was futile; they rose for a second, but resettled 
instantly; a few, indeed, winged their way to the 
distant parts of the room, but only to return with a 
reinforcement of their friends, who were vainly seek- 
ing a livelihood on the windows. 

Murmurs of astonishment escaped from the com- 
pany, as this new batch assailed Monsieur le Mar- 
quis; he fanned his head, but it was of no use; he 
shook it vehemently, but with no better success; at 
length, the sugar becoming dissolved by the heat, 
trickled in saccharine rivulets over his forehead, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 109 

which was soon covered by his tormentors, buzzing 
and tickling so dreadfully, that even old regime 
impassibilite could stand it no longer. The unfor- 
tunate Frenchman started to his feet, and violently 
clasping his head with both his hands, rushed from 
the room, enveloped in a cloud of powder and flies; 
his tormentors, and the echoes of an uncontrollable 
burst of laughter, following him up the staircase. 
When he was gone, Brummell and his confederate, 
of course, expressed more surprise than any one else, 
that the flies should have taken such a violent fancy 
to the Frenchman's powder and pomatum. 

Another gentleman, who suffered by his pranks, 
was a Mr. Snodgrass, I believe an F.R.S., and very 
fond of scientific pursuits; probably the reason why 
he was singled out by Brummell as a fit and proper 
object for his fun. Accompanied by several friends, 
he once knocked up this savant, at three o'clock on a 
fine frosty morning; and when, under the impression 
of his house being on fire, he protruded his body en 
chemise, and his head in a nightcap, from the window, 
the Beau put the following very interesting question 
to him : — " Pray, sir, is your name Snodgrass? " 
" Yes, sir," said he, very anxiously, " my name is 
Snodgrass." " Snodgrass — Snodgrass," repeated 
Brummell, " a very odd name that, upon my soul; a 
very odd name indeed ! But, sir, is your name really 
Snodgrass? " Here the philosopher, with the thermo- 
meter below freezing point, naturally got into a tower- 
ing passion, and threatened to call the watch; where- 


no THE LIFE OF 

upon Brummell walked off, with — " Good morning to 
you, Mr. Snodgrass." 

Such were the absurd tricks in which Brummell 
indulged; and though he was not a wit in the literal 
sense of the word, like Lord Erskine, Sheridan, or 
Jekyll, he had a happy facility in placing the most 
ordinary circumstances in a ridiculous point of view, 
and never refrained, when opportunity offered, from 
indulging his taste for exciting the risible muscles even 
of those who, very probably, thought but little of his 
talent in this way. He had, also, a singular power of 
giving an agreeable effect to a word or action, that in 
any one else would have been perhaps unnoticed; or, 
if noticed — condemned : but his happy hardihood 
generally carried him through the difficulties into which 
his fearless love of originality sometimes plunged him. 
It was, I believe, from one of his odd speeches that a 
certain gentleman, well known in the world, received the 
sobriquet of Poodle Byng. It seems that Mr. Byng 
had in his youth very beautiful hair, which curled 
naturally, and it was his practice, not an unusual one 
in the days of curricles, to be accompanied in his by 
his French dog. One day Brummell, who was on 
horseback, met them quietly driving together in the 
park, and hailed his friend with, "Ah, Byng, how do 
you do? — a family vehicle, I see ! " 

His affectation, which was principally assumed for 
the purpose of amusing those about him, was another 
characteristic of his wit. He pretended to look upon 
the City as a terra incognita; and when some great 


M 


BEAU BRUMMELL. in 

merchant requested the honour of his company at 
dinner, he replied, " With pleasure, if you will promise 
faithfully not to tell." But a certain ex-secretary of 
the Admiralty, of graver parts and great political and 
literary talents, has, since his time, carried on the joke 
to Bloomsbury, or some other square in that direction; 
for, it is related of him, that, when invited to dine in 
that remote region, he piquantly inquired where he 
was to change horses? a mot which has, no doubt 
inadvertently, wandered into Pelham. The following 
are some of the Beau's j'eux d1 esprit that were at one 
time in general circulation, and a few of which have 
already been in print. 

An acquaintance having, in a morning call, bored 
him dreadfully about some tour he had made in the 
North of England, enquired with great pertinacity of 
his impatient listener which of the lakes he preferred? 
when Brummell, quite tired of the man's tedious rap- 
tures, turned his head imploringly towards his valet, 
who was arranging something in the room, and said, 
" Robinson." " Sir." " Which of the lakes do I 
admire? " " Windermere, sir," replied that distin- 
guished individual. " Ah, yes, — Windermere," re- 
peated Brummell, " so it is, — Windermere." A 
lady at dinner, observing that he did not take any 
vegetables, asked him whether such was his general 
habit, and if he never ate any? He replied, " Yes, 
madam, I once ate a pea." 

One day a friend, meeting him limping in Bond 
Street, asked him what was the matter? He replied, 


H2 THE LIFE OF 

he had hurt his leg, and the worst of it was, " It was 
his favourite leg." Having been asked by a sympa- 
thising friend how he happened to get such a severe 
cold? His reply was, " Why, do you know, I left 
my carriage yesterday evening, on my way to town 
from the Pavilion, and the infidel of a landlord put me 
into a room with a damp stranger." 

On being asked by one of his acquaintance, during 
a very unseasonable summer, if he had ever seen such 
a one? He replied, " Yes, last winter." Having 
fancied himself invited to some one's country seat, and 
being given to understand, after one night's lodging, 
that he was in error, he told an unconscious friend in 
town, who asked him what sort of a place it was? 
" that it was an exceedingly good house for stopping 
one night in." 

At an Ascot meeting, and early in the day, 

Brummell walked his horse up to Lady 's 

carriage, when she expressed her surprise at his 
throwing away his time on her, or thinking of run- 
ning the risk of being seen talking to such a very 
quiet and unfashionable person. " My dear Lady 

," he replied, " pray don't mention it; there is 

no one near us." 

The principal portion of this chapter has been 
devoted to the consideration of Brummell's most 
unamiable qualities, to his powers of detraction, his 
satirical remarks, and practical jokes; but let not the 
reader imagine they preponderated to the exclusion of 
better ones. No one possessed the art of pleasing to 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 113 

a greater degree, or exercised it with greater effect, 
when he was in the society of those he liked, whatever 
might be their age or station; had he been the 
superlatively insolent character he is generally repre- 
sented, he would have been universally cut, instead of 
sought after — the absurdity of the notion is its most 
complete refutation. Well do I remember the lecture 
on good manners that he gave a young gentleman at 
Caen, who had justly laid himself open to censure, by 
the thoughtless omission of an act of courtesy, that 
Brummell considered due to a lady near whom the 
youth was standing. 

"Civility, my good fellow," observed the Beau, 
" may truly be said to cost nothing; if it does not 
meet with a due return, it at least leaves you in the 
most creditable position. When I was young, I was 
acquainted with a striking example of what may 
sometimes be gained by it, though my friend on this 
occasion did not, I assure you, expect to benefit by 
his politeness. In leaving the Opera one evening, a 
short time previous to the fall of the curtain, he 
overtook in the lobby an elderly lady, making her 
way out to avoid the crowd; she was dressed in a 
most peculiar manner, with hoop and brocade, and a 
pyramid of hair; in fact, she was at least a century 
behind the rest of the world in her costume : so 
singular an apparition had attracted the attention of 
half a dozen ' Lord Dukes,' and ' Sir Harrys/ sitting 
in the lobby, and as she slowly moved towards the 
box entrance, they amused themselves by making 
VOL. i. H 


114 THE LIFE OF 

impertinent remarks on her extraordinary dress and 
infirm gait. 

" Directly my friend caught sight of them, and 
saw what they were after, he went to her assistance, 
threatened to give them in charge to a Bow Street 
officer, and with his best bow offered her his arm. 
She accepted it, and on the stairs he enquired 
whether she had a chair or a carriage? at the 
same time intimating his willingness to go for one. 
' Thank you, sir, I have my chair,' replied the old 
lady, ' if you will only be good enough to remain 
with me until it arrives : ' as she was speaking, her 
servants came up with it, and making the cavalier a 
very stately curtsy, she requested to know to whom 
she had the honour of being indebted for so much 
attention? ' My name, madam/ replied the stranger, 
as he handed her to her chair, ' is Boothby, but I am 
usually called Prince Boothby; ' upon which the 
antiquated lady thanked him once more, and left. 
Well, from that hour Boothby never saw her again, 
and did not even hear of her till her death, which 
took place a few years after; when he received a 
letter from her lawyer, announcing to him the agree- 
able intelligence of her having left him heir to several 
thousands a year ! Now, my good sir," said Brummel 
to the abashed but youthful delinquent, " for the future, 
pray remember Prince Boothby." 

John Skrimshire Boothby, was one of the most 
celebrated of the fine gentlemen of his day, the great 
peculiarity of whose dress was the shape of his hat, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 115 

which he never changed. He is supposed to be the 
person alluded to by Foote in one of his farces, as 
distinguished by his partiality for people of high rank, 
and ready at any time to leave a baronet to walk with 
a baron, — " to be genteelly damned beside a duke, 
rather than saved in vulgar company." Moore, in 
allusion to him, or his double, says, 

" Beside him place the god of wit, 
Before him beauty's rosiest girls, 
Apollo for a star he'd quit, 
And Love's own sister for an Earl's." 

Booth by was well bred, intelligent, .and amiable, but 
extremely eccentric, and he ended his career at his 
house in Clarges Street by his own hand, in July 
1800. His servants at the inquest bore the strongest 
testimony to his character as a good master, and a 
kind-hearted man. He had been possessed of three 
large estates; the first was his own inheritance, 
which he dissipated; the second came to him from 
a distant family connection; and the third was the 
gift of the ancient lady in the lobby, whose name was 
Clopton, which he afterwards added to his own. 
Boothby was a great friend of the fifth Duke of 
Rutland, Lords Carlisle and Derby, and Charles 
Fox; and was brother-in-law to that fox-hunting 
centaur, the late Hugo Meynell. He was also a 
member of the clubs in St. James Street, where he 
used to play very high; and he is mentioned in 
Moore's Life of Sheridan as having made a bet with 


Ii6 THE LIFE OF 

the orator of five hundred guineas, that there would 
not be a reform in the representation of the people of 
England, within three years from the date of the bet, 
the 2Qth of January 1793. Mr. Moore does not say 
that Sheridan paid.

CHAPTER IX. 

Brummelts Softer Moments— His Numerous Offers — His Honesty in 
Love Affairs — The Intended Mrs. Brummell—His Flirtations and 
Love Letters — His Great Popularity with the Fair Sex— His Good- 
Nature — Miss Seymour's Letter to him — BnunmelFs regard for her. 

THOUGH I have already alluded to Brummell's pre- 
dilection for female society, I have not yet spoken 
of those moments, perhaps the most interesting of 
a man's life, at least to himself — his moments of 
tendresse. Brummell had his; but the organ of 
love in his cranium was only faintly developed. 
His temperament was elephantine; still it was 
scarcely possible for him to be constantly in the 
society of the most beautiful and accomplished girls 
in Europe, — and who will deny that the daughters of 
our aristocracy are so? — without having a prefer- 
ence for one of them, or perhaps half a dozen; and 
this was the case; for he never attained any degree 
of intimacy with a pretty woman of rank that he did 
not make her an offer, not with any idea of being 
accepted, but because he thought it was paying the 
lady a great compliment, and procured her an un- 
usual degree of eclat in the fashionable world. His 
original view of the subject appears to have been 


### Page 118

generally understood and acted upon by his friends. 
One of his idols, however, seemed inclined to take 

him at his word, Lady W; and often have I 

heard him rave about her. 

But Brummell's vanity and honesty in love affairs 
were equally extraordinary. It is related of him 
that he came one morning into the library of a noble 
friend, at whose house he was a frequent visitor, 
and told him, with much warmth and sincerity of 
manner, that he was very sorry, very sorry indeed, 
but he must positively leave Park that morn- 
ing. " Why, you were not to go till next month ! " 
said the hospitable peer. " True, true," replied 
Brummell anxiously, " but I must be off." " But 
what for? " " Why the fact is — I am in love with 
your countess." " Well, my dear fellow, never 
mind that, so was I twenty years ago — is she in 
love with you? " The Beau hesitated, and after 
scrutinising for a few seconds the white sheep-skin 
rug, said faintly, " I — believe she is." " Oh ! that 
alters the case entirely," replied the earl; " I will 
send for your post-horses immediately." Once, 
however, though not with a lady of rank, he did 
very nearly " his quietus make with a gold ring; " 
for he interested the demoiselle sufficiently to induce 
her to consent to elope with him. The most favour- 
able opportunity that presented itself for so doing, 
was at a ball in the neighbourhood of Grosvenor 
Square; but his measures on the occasion were so 
badly taken, that he and the intended Mrs. Brummell 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 119 

were caught at the corner of the next street, a 
servant having turned mother's evidence. It is said 
that when a friend rallied him on his evident want 
of success in another matrimonial speculation, and 
pressed him for the reason of his failure, Brummell 
replied with a smile, " Why, what could I do, my 
good fellow, but cut the connection? I discovered 
that Lady Mary actually ate cabbage ! " 

But all this tells very little either for his judg- 
ment or his feeling; and it was rather extraordinary 
that, with all the advantages and opportunities he 
enjoyed, he did not select one lovely flower from the 
parterre of rank, fashion, and wealth, and wear it 
for life. However, independently of his deficiency 
in warmth and perseverance, he had too much self- 
love ever to be really in love; had Cupid's arrow 
been a cloth-yard long, and had he drawn it to the 
head like the stout archer in Chevy Chase, it would 
scarcely have reached the Beau's heart, or if it had 
would merely have tickled, not wounded it. He 
was a thorough flirt, his love was as light and as 
elegant as everything else about him, and, in none of 
his disappointments was he likely to have recourse 
to a pan of charcoal, or the Serpentine; it was the 
transitory sentiment which, in a subsequent letter, 
he says, is " so often and so easily expressed with 
a crow-quill, and its feigned regret by tears, made 
with a sponge and rose-water, upon perfumed paper." 
In this trifling with the god of love he through life 
delighted to indulge; and the following laughable 


120 . THE LIFE OF 

and amusing letters are specimens of his style in 
conducting a correspondence of the kind : — 

" MY DEAR LADY JANE, — With the miniature it seems 
I am not to be trusted, even for two pitiful hours; 
my own memory must be, then, my only disconsolate 
expedient to obtain a resemblance. 

" As I am unwilling to merit the imputation of com- 
mitting myself, by too flagrant a liberty, in retaining 
your glove, which you charitably sent at my head 
yesterday, as you would have extended an eleemosy- 
nary sixpence to the supplicating hat of a mendicant, 
I restore it to you; and allow me to assure you, that 
I have too much regard and respect for you, and too 
little practical vanity myself (whatever appearances 
may be against me), to have entertained, for one 
treacherous instant, the impertinent intention to 
defraud you of it. You are angry, perhaps irreparably 
incensed against me, for this petty larceny. I have 
no defence to offer in mitigation, but that of frenzy. 
But we know that you are an angel visiting these 
sublunary spheres, and therefore your first quality 
should be that of mercy; }'et you are sometimes way- 
ward and volatile in your seraphic disposition — though 
you have no wings, still you have weapons; and these 
are, resentment and estrangement from me. With 
sentiments of the deepest compunction, I am always, 
your miserable slave, GEORGE BRUMMELL. 

"The Lady Jane , Harley Street." 


BEAU BR VMM ELL. 1 2 1 

* 

" DEAR Miss , — When I wrote to you a cen- 
tury ago, in plaintive strains, and with ' all Hackman's 
sorrows1 and all Werther's woes,' you told me, with 
pen dipped in oblivion's ink from Lethe's stream, that 
I must desist from my vagaries, because I was tres- 
passing on consecrated ground; but you offered me 
instead, your friendship, as a relic — by way of a bone 
to pick, among all my refined and elegant sensibilities ! 
Well, I struggled hard to bring myself to this meagre 
abnegation, and my efforts promised to be propitious. 
I kissed the rod, cherished the relic, and enveloped 
myself in austerity and sackcloth. I then, by way of 
initiating myself to penance, inscribed you a missive, 
in appropriate terms of mortification, presuming, too, 
that it was the privilege, if not the duty, of my voca- 
tion, to mortify you, also, as a votary, with a little 
congenial castigation. I dare say I wrote to you in a 
most absurd and recriminating manner, for I was 
excited by the pious enthusiasm of my recent apostasy; 
and I was anxious to impress upon your more favour- 
able opinion, the exemplary and salutary progress I 
had made in my new school. You are, it seems, dis- 
pleased at it, though my heresy from my first delight- 
ful faith was your own work. I know not now where 
to turn for another belief. 

" I will tell you the truth in plain unmystical lan- 
guage, for 1 have not yet learnt to renounce that; I was 
irritated because I thought you had cut me dead in

the morning; and when I was tete-a-tete with my 
solitary lamp in the evening, a thousand threatening 
phantoms assailed me. I imagined that you had 
abandoned me; in short, a cohort of blue devils got 
the better of me, and I am now all compunction and 
anguish. Pray be once more an amiable and com- 
passionate being, and do not contract your lovely eye- 
brows any more (I wish to Heaven I could see them 
at this instance !) in sullenness at all my numberless 
incongruities and sins. Be the same Samaritan saint 
you have already been to me : you shall never more 
repent it. Whatever I may have said in a frenical 
moment of exasperation was unsaid and unthought an 
hour afterwards, when I sought my couch, and prof- 
fered my honest prayers for forgiveness from above, 
and profanely from you who are upon earth. I am 
more than conscious of all my derelictions — of all 
my faults, but indeed they shall be in future corrected, 
if you are still a friend to me. I had vaunted, in the 
vanity of my chivalrous spirit, that I had at length 
proved one in myself; but it was empty ostentation, 
for I find that I cannot exist but in amity with you. 
— Your unfortunate supplicant, 

" GEORGE BRUMMELL." 

Love, indeed, but of this harmless character, formed 
one of the Beau's distractions in exile; and the fol- 
lowing letter, which, like all the others, I beg to 
assure the reader is perfectly authentic, is an amusing 
proof, not only how sensitive he was on the subject, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 123 

even in mature age, but also how he succeeded in 
awakening an interest for him in the minds of those 
who were both young and beautiful. The reader will 
remember, the mind — not the heart. 

" RUE ROYALE, , Wednesday. 

"Yesterday morning I was subdued almost to in- 
sanity, but your note in the evening restored me to 
peace and equanimity, and, as if I had been redeemed 
from earthly purgatory, placed me in heaven. Thank 
you, thank you, dearest of beings; how can I retri- 
bute all this benevolent open-heartedness, this delight- 
ful proof and avowal of my not being indifferent to 
you? I cannot, by inanimate words, represent the 
excess of my feelings towards you : take, then, with 
indulgent admission and forbearance, the simple boon 
and sacred pledge of my heart's deepest affections for 
you; they are rooted in my very soul and existence; 
they will never deviate; they will never die away. 
By the glimmering light that was remaining I per- 
ceived something in white at your porte-cochere. It 
was evident that I was recognised, and the figure 
advanced with your billet. In an instant I seized 
the hand of your faithful and intelligent messenger, 
compressed it forcibly, and had she been as for- 
bidding as the old dowager Duchess of , I 

should have saluted her, if I had not fancied at the 
instant that I heard some one coming up the street. 
We parted, and I returned to my solitary chamber. 
There I lacerated the letter with impatience, and

then the light of love and of joy, and the refreshing 
breath of evening stole through the open window 
over my entranced senses. After that I sought 
another stroll on the ramparts, and again returned 
home contented with you, with myself, and with 
the world. 

' I slept the slumbers of a saint forgiven, 
And mild as opening dreams of promised heaven.' 

" I have known few that could equal, none that 
could excel you; yet they possessed not your charm 
of countenance, your form, your heart, in my estima- 
tion. Certainly they did not possess that unaffected 
and fervent homage, which in my constant memory, — 
in my heart's life-blood, — and in my devoted soul I 
bear to you. — Ever most affectionately yours, 

" GEORGE BRUMMELL." 

Such were the pathetic appeals that he addressed 
to single women — in warm weather; for his heart 
seldom thawed to this extent before the middle of 
June, and probably the first frost that nipped the 
dahlias crisped it up again till the following summer; 
at least sufficiently so to prevent him from shivering 
and shaking near his lady love's porte-cochere, in 
expectation of a note : he could write hundreds by 
his fireside at all seasons. As regards his London 
life, however, he generally preferred the society of 
married women, whose greater acquaintance with the 
world made them far more amusing companions than 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 125 

single ones; and without any pretensions to bonnes 
fortunes, he was the idol of all those who took any 
lead in high life : happy was she in whose opera-box 
he would pass an hour, whose assembly he would 
attend, or at whose table he would dine. He had 
also a strong partiality for two or three widows, whose 
names, however, I should be very sorry to disclose to 
the present generation; and I leave Brummell's con- 
temporaries to fix upon any peeress they may think 
proper, as the one to whom the following letter was 
addressed : — 

" Chesterfield Street. 

" DEAR LADY , — I am almost inclined to believe 

that you have forgotten me in the protracted space 
of five days, and that you have amused your leisure 
hours with something or somebody more interesting 
to you. You are too overtly severe with Lord 
L; he has effrontery enough to persuade him- 
self that you are piqued with him, and he will inter- 
pret that into a latent interest for him : what can 
it possibly be to you, whether he goes to Bright- 
helmstone or not? Affront him, but with dexterity, 
and his own consummate and mistaken vanity will be 
his speediest drawback; but never make an enemy 
of a man whose physiognomy has been ravaged by 
the small-pox, — for whom Jenner has lived in vain !

has not perceptibly touched a bristle of his raven 
crown since you saw, or rather turned away your 
eyes from him. In submission to your desire, I 
have minutely scrutinised his head. He had the 
effrontery, the other day, to be irritated because I 
asked him to lend me his brush of a sconce to assist 
at the morning toilette of my boots ! The monster ! 
Do not forget your parasol in this inflammatory 
weather. — Yours devoutly, 

"GEORGE BRUMMELL. 

"The Lady , Brighthelmstone." 

But though his own affections seem never to have 
been very deeply engaged, the following letter shows 
that he possessed considerable sense and good feeling, 
when those of others, in whose welfare he took a real 
interest, were concerned. It was written by Miss 
Seymour, and is introduced here as a striking and 
authentic proof of Brummell's good-nature. It is 
unnecessary to refer to the actual circumstances alluded 
to by the amiable and lovely writer : I will merely 
observe, that the information he gave her was of the 
utmost value, and that it is highly probable it would 
never have come to her knowledge but for his dis- 
interested kindness.

" Wednesday morning. 

" I am more obliged to you than I can express for 
your note : be assured that your approbation of my 
conduct has given me very sincere pleasure : this is 
the only means I have of telling you so; for I am in 
such disgrace, that I do not know if I shall be taken 
to the play; — in any case, I shall be watched; there- 
fore accept my most cordial thanks, and believe that 
I shall remember your good-nature to me on this 
occasion, with gratitude, to the end of my life. 

" does not know how unkindly I have been 

treated, but is more affectionate than ever, because he 
sees I am unhappy. We did not arrive in town till 
seven last night, therefore no play; to-morrow they 
go to Covent Garden : — perhaps I may be allowed to 
be of the party. 

" Pray don't neglect my drawing; you would make 
me very happy by lending me the yellow book again; 
the other I don't ask for, much as I wish for it. 
Adieu ! I shall be steady in my opinion of you, and 
always remain, yours, very sincerely, 

" GEORGIANA A. F. SEYMOUR." 

" This beautiful creature is dead ! " was the remark 
Brummell had written at the bottom of the letter, 
which he kept as a memento of her friendship for him 
till within four years of his death; he then parted 
with it, but only to a very intimate friend, who wished 
for the autograph.

a groom, who had been in his service : it bears the 
Cheltenham postmark.

" If you are as conceited as formerly, I shall stand 
accused of taking your groom, to give me an oppor- 
tunity of writing to you for his character. All the

informed whether you were as well satisfied with

James Ell when you parted with him, as when he

may imagine I am not a little happy, in having it in

I was extremely pleased with my tour, and charmed 
with Italy. 

" I saw a good deal of your friend Capel at Naples; 
if he fights the battles of his country by sea as well 
as he fights yours by land, he certainly is one of our 
first commanders. But of him you must have heard 
so full an account from Lord Althorp,2 for they were 
inseparable, that I will only add he was as yet unsuc- 
cessful in the important research after a perfect snuff- 
box, when I left Italy.3 What news the last despatch 
may have brought upon this subject I am ignorant 
of, but take it for granted you are not; as in all 
probability the Phoebe was by your interest appointed 
to the Mediterranean station for three years, to accom- 
plish this grand and useful discovery. Should it 
prove a successful one, Capel, on his return, will of 
course be made Admiral of the White, for the signal

" HESTER L. STANHOPE." 

That Lady Hester knew the Beau well is evident 
from the first paragraph in her letter. In it she 
disarms him at the onset •, and in her fearless 
disposition, makes no difficulty of lashing him and 
his friends, with a keenness and dexterity quite 
equal to his own, and, apparently, with as much 
pleasure : of course she had an advantage in the 
lady's privilege, of saying what she pleased; but 
there is every reason to suppose, that, when Brum- 
mell returned her a compendium of James Ell's 

signal-lieutenant of Nelson's ship, the Vanguard, at the battle of the 
Nile, and was promoted for his conduct on that day. He also 
rendered important services to the fleet when in command of the 
Phoebe, after Trafalgar. Sir Bladen likewise commanded the Endy- 
mion, at the passage of the Dardanelles, in 1807, and was actively 
employed in the Hogue on the coast of America, from 1812 to the conclu- 
sion of the war. It was while serving on this station that his ship was 
nearly blown up by a petard. The admiral entered the navy at the 
early age of six years, and died in 1853, when he was seventy-seven 
years old.

qualifications in stable affairs, he did not conclude 
his billet, without responding to the gossip and 
raillery that pervaded hers. 

After perusing this amusing letter, one is tempted 
to think what a pity it was, for her friends and 
society, that Lady Hester emigrated to the mountains 
of Lebanon, on which the cedars would have grown 
just as well without her; but the letter affords some 
indication of the independent disposition that she 
afterwards displayed to such an unusual degree,, and 
in a manner so perfectly original; for it must be 
admitted, that it was, at least, a slight deviation from 
ordinary custom, for a young lady to write to a 
gentleman on such a subject. 

Independence like her ladyship's could hardly 
be accounted for by her education, singular as it 
must have been under the direction of " Citizen 
Stanhope; " much less by an early introduction to 
men's society at her uncle's table; though there may, 
perchance, have been occasionally an adventurous 
spirit amongst the philo-politicals at Mr. Pitt's 
parliamentary dinners, of which she so gracefully 
did the honours. — But, in whatever cause this 
feeling originated, it is difficult to reconcile Lady 
Hester's long residence in the mountains of Lebanon, 
associating only with the wild Arab, or living in the 
most complete seclusion, with the love of her father- 
land shown in that part of her letter, in which she 
expresses her delight " to scamper on British ground; " 


1 32 THE LIFE OF 

and the pleasure which it may be supposed she 
enjoyed in the society with which she was familiar, 
the most recherche of her own class. Why did 
Lady Hester thus expatriate herself? — was it for 
love? If so, for whom, or what — her uncle's 
memory, or Beau Brummell? Certain it is, that in 
her solitude the latter was still remembered by her, 
even as late as the year 1830. 

A friend of the author's, then serving in the 
Mediterranean, having obtained leave of absence 
for a few months, spent a portion of that year in 
wandering through Palestine and the adjacent coun- 
tries, and in his travels he paid a visit to the " old 
Lady of the Mountain," who received him most 
graciously, for he was the bearer of a letter from an 
old friend of hers; and Lady Hester signified her 
willingness to grant him an interview, the day after 
he had made her aware of his arrival by sending her 
his credentials — these were highly necessary, for she 
was not in the habit of so favouring travellers in 
general. 

At the hour named, therefore, my friend, full of 
anxiety to see and converse with such a singular 
character, made his way to her house : he was 
admitted by a little black female slave, possibly a 
mute, for it was in perfect silence that she ushered 
him into an apartment, so dark, that he could with 
difficulty discover the ottoman, on which a voice at 
the other end of it desired him to be seated; he had 


BEAU BR UMMELL. 1 33 

scarcely obeyed, when a very small latticed window 
near him was suddenly opened by some invisible 
means, and the light thrown full upon his countenance, 
without, however, having any, or but little effect in 
relieving the obscurity, which reigned complete at 
the opposite end of the long room. 

When his eyes had become somewhat accustomed 
to the glare, he saw a female figure sitting a Vorientale 
on a carpet, dressed in the Eastern style, and by her 
side the black slave who had been his guide. Lady 
Hester, for it was his hostess who now addressed 
him, enquired first after the Duke of Wellington, and 
then after George Brummell; these two being appar- 
ently the only individuals of her own, or any other 
European nation, for whom she seemed to entertain 
the smallest interest, as, during the remainder of his 
audience, she adverted only to events that were 
passing in the country of her adoption. It would 
have been extraordinary, indeed, had Lady Hester 
not been anxious for intelligence respecting the hero 
of her younger days, the victor of Assaye; with 
whom she had probably been acquainted before she 
left England, and the details of whose subsequent 
career had been the theme of admiration, even of the 
rude mountaineers that surrounded her, — but that she 
should have been interested in obtaining tidings of 
the Beau was rather remarkable. 

Let not the reader imagine, however, I was 
serious, in insinuating that her ladyship entertained 
any tender sentiments for Brummell. Lady Hester 


134. THE LIFE OF 

is said to have mourned one of a very different 
mould — he who was by his gallant soldiers, buried 


•" darkly at dead of night, 


The sod with their bayonets turning; 

By the struggling moonbeams' misty light, 

And the lantern dimly burning." 

This rumour was, I believe, entirely without 
foundation, though dates and circumstances gave 
some appearance of truth to it. Sir John Moore fell 
on the l6th of January 1809, and Lady Hester left 
England in deep mourning and for ever early in the 
spring of the following year : her Ladyship's half- 
brother, Major Stanhope, was also slain at the battle 
of Corunna. It was of this officer, and the hero 
of Meanee, while leading on the Fiftieth Regiment, 
that Sir John Moore said, " Well done, my Majors ! " 
Such was the imperfect recollection I retained of 
the fireside narrative my friend gave me, some years 
ago, of his interesting visit to Lady Hester; and I 
was regretting his absence, as he could have made 
my sketch so much more worthy of the reader's 
perusal, when he opportunely arrived in England. 
Of course I immediately availed myself of this for- 
tunate circumstance, and the following letter contains 
his own striking and animated description of herself 
and her wild retreat; which he forwarded to me 
with a kindness and promptitude, that proved, how 
little his friendship or his memory was impaired 
by the time that had elapsed since we met. 


BEAU B RUM M ELL. 135 

" Many years have passed since I was in Syria; 
but, as you desire it, I will endeavour to describe 
my visit to Lady Hester Stanhope, as well as my 
memory permits. I was furnished with a letter of 

introduction from Lord , which I sent from 

Sidon; a knowledge of her disinclination to receive 
Englishmen generally, having prevented my deliver- 
ing it personally when passing near hjer abode on my 
way from Damascus. Her ladyship, however, ac- 
knowledged the letter most politely, invited me and 
my companion to visit her for as long a time as we 
found it convenient, and sent two fine Arabian horses 
to convey us to her residence, which was formerly 
a convent, and crowns the summit of a hill about 
eight miles from Sidon. 

" The ascent to Mar Elias (for so the convent is 
called) was steep, and the approach to it more like 
that of a crusading baron's castle than of the resi- 
dence of a solitary lady, whose education had been 
finished, and early habits formed, amongst the most 
refined and intellectual of the English nobility. A 
strong guard of Albanians protected the gate, and 
numbers of armed men, of the same nation, were 
idling about, as if time was a heavy burthen on their 
hands. We were conducted to a kiosk or summer- 
house, outside the main building, and there an Italian, 
dressed like an Arab, received us and provided 
dinner in the European fashion; this last appeared to 
be a matter of some difficulty, as her Ladyship con- 
formed to the Eastern habits, in eating, dress, and 


1 36 THE LIFE OF 

other matters, and some time had elapsed since plates 
and forks had been called into requisition. During 
dinner, an Arab, who spoke French most volubly, 
made his appearance and told us he was her Lady- 
ship's astrologer, and enlarged upon her good fortune 
in possessing so talented a wizard as himself. 

" Soon after, Lady Hester sent to say, she would 
be happy to receive us; and we were accordingly 
ushered through several apartments, by various 
attendants, until we reached a small and rather dark 
room, in which sat her Ladyship, dressed as an Arab 
sheick, and looking more like a young man than 
an elderly lady. She sat with her back to the light, 
which streamed in through a small window full on 
our faces; this she afterwards told me was arranged 
on purpose to give her a fair scrutiny of the faces 
of her visitors : chibouques (the long cherry-stick 
pipe) were introduced, and in a short time she be- 
came most agreeably communicative. 

" Her conversation was more than ordinarily elo- 
quent, though tinctured with somewhat of the strange- 
ness that pervaded her whole life and character : 
her thorough knowledge of the language, habits, 
and customs of the East, combined with the ease 
with which she expressed her ideas, enabled her to 
draw the most vivid pictures of those countries, and 
convey her information in a very agreeable manner. 
Nor was her conversation by any means confined 
to these subjects; for when trifling circumstances 
recalled her thoughts to the days of her youth, when 


BE A U BR VMM ELL. 137 

she presided at Mr. Pitt's table, she described those 
scenes, and the persons of such as were admitted to 
the circle of her uncle's society, as faithfully and 
minutely as if the memory of them had not been 
overlaid, by the eight-and-twenty years she had 
passed amidst the exciting events of her later life. 

" Beau Brummell, who was in her youthful days 
the friend of the Prince of Wales, and envied and 
admired by both beaux and belles of all ranks of 
society, appeared to have been an especial favourite 
of hers; and though I am unable to repeat the 
description as she gave it, I can even now fancy 
that I see him riding up to her in the Park in a 
suit of plum-coloured clothes, to give her a stick of 
perfume of his own manufacture; a peculiar mark 
of favour, granted only on condition that she pro- 
mised faithfully not to give a morsel to the Prince, 
who was dying to get some. 

" I hinted at Brummell's eccentricities; but she 
replied, that he was an exceedingly clever man, 
always suiting his conversation to his hearers, and 
that he almost always paid her the compliment of 
talking very sensibly. She added, that she had once 
rebuked him for some folly or other, and inquired 
why so clever a person as he was did not devote 
his talents to a higher purpose than he did? To 
which Brummell replied, that he knew human nature 
well, and that he had adopted the only course which 
could place him in a prominent light, and enable him 
to separate himself from the society of the ordinary 


138 THE LIFE OF 

herd of men, whom he held in considerable contempt. 
These conversations, with the attendant chibouque, 
which her Ladyship smoked as determinedly as the 
longest-bearded Mussulman in the land, were gene- 
rally prolonged until near daylight, when we retired 
to rest. 

" During the day we were left to amuse ourselves, 
and did not see our kind hostess until after a late 
dinner. On one occasion, however, she showed 
us her garden, which, though very small, was laid 
out with great taste, and in the Eastern style, and 
contained many very beautiful and rare flowers. 
Trellises and lattice-work, covered with creepers, 
were so arranged, that, when lit with lamps, and 
viewed from the convent windows, the garden would 
look exactly like a scene in the opera. 

"Lady Hester had acquired considerable influence 
amongst the Arab tribes, with whom she passed 
much time during the earlier period of her resi- 
dence in Syria : this she obtained, partly because, 
though she professed a partial belief in the Koran, 
and conformed to most of their customs and pre- 
judices, her life and habits were beyond their com- 
prehension; and her morality being unquestioned, 
they looked upon her somewhat in the light of a 
supernatural being — a belief that she was inclined 
to encourage, rather than undeceive. Having tried 
her courage, which was indomitable, and experienced 
her hospitality, and the readiness with which her 
purse was opened to every call of distress, some of 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 139 

the tribes near Palmyra endeavoured to persuade her 
to permit herself to be called " Sovereign of the 
Desert; " and, as she assured me, prepared a sort 
of ceremony for her installation at Palmyra; — an 
honour, however, which she prudently declined. She 
believed in all kinds of astrology, and some of the 
wildest of the Eastern legends; especially in that 
which alludes to the Thirteenth Imaum, whom she 
called the Saviour, and for whom she kept a horse 
that had the natural mark of a Saddle on its back, 
which she said had never been mounted by man or 
woman.1 

" She also told me, that her astrologer had been 
closely observing us, during our first dinner, and 
had been able to assure her, that we were not 
born under a hostile planet, nor had either of us red 
hair, or foreheads ' villanously low; ' for, had such 

1 Mussulman reckon, I think, twelve Imaums, commencing with 
Moussa (Moses), Ibrahim (Abraham), and Husrut Esau (Jesus Christ), 
the Healer of the Lame and Blind, and their own prophet Mahomet, 
&c. The word is also applied to the principal sects, as Ali, the 
Imaum of the Persians, or the sect of the Shiaites; Abu-Beker the 
Imaum of the Sunnites, the sect of the Turks; and San, of another 
sect, &c. 

The Mahometans look for the advent or reappearance of another 
Imaum, who will convert the whole world to the faith of Islam, and 
reign on earth for a time in great glory and happiness : the end of this 
period and of the world will be simultaneous. The Mussulmen of 
India and Affghanistan expected the advent alluded to in A.D. 1842, 
and thought their successes at Cabul a prelude to it. A Belooch chief, 
when consulting a friend of the writer of this note, as to the advantage 
of his surrendering on certain terms, observed that if he could but hold 
out a little longer, his surrender would be rendered unnecessary by the 
appearance of the Thirteenth Imaum, whose arrival in that year was 
predicted by all the learned Faquirs in India. 


HO THE LIFE OF 

been the case, she would have been unable to have 
admitted us to her presence; and this precaution 
she always took, with those who were favoured by 
a reception at her house. Being aware of a prophecy 
believed by the Mussulmen of Damascus, which de- 
clares that the Turkish Empire will crumble to pieces 
in a certain number of years, after the day on which 
a Christian or Jew shall first ride on horseback 
through the holy gate which leads to Mecca — she 
rode up to the guard stationed there with her suite 
(always numerous and formidably armed), spurred her 
horse, dashed through it, and went straight to the 
durbar of the Pacha, to acquaint him with her exploit. 

" In the course of conversation, during the last 
night we remained at Mar Elias, she inquired whether 
we had seen the Emir Beschir, and on our replying 
in the negative, she clapped her hands, and the little 
black slave, who appeared, with hands crossed over 
her bosom, to answer the summons, was directed to 
call the scribe, to whom she dictated an epistle, which 
was despatched on the instant to the emir; saying, 
that two friends of hers would visit him next day, 
and desiring a suitable reception. Soon after daylight 
the messenger returned, though the emir's residence 
was some miles distant, bringing a cordial invitation, 
which we accepted. 

" It was not without a feeling of great sadness 
that I took leave of Lady Hester; but when I ventured 
to hint at the possibility of her return to Europe, she 
cut the conversation short, by asking me if I thought 


BEAU BR U MM ELL. 1 4 1 

she could make up her mind to knit or sew like an 
Englishwoman, after having spent her life amid the 
stirring scenes she had been constantly engaged in? 
I then alluded to her forlorn situation, among men 
upon whose consciences the blood of a lone woman 
would have scarce weighed heavily; but her eyes 
flashed fire, as she replied, drawing a dagger from 
her breast, ' Who would be the first to venture on 
the wild cat in her den? ' Her reply to the consul 
at Cairo, who addressed her by desire of Ibrahim 
Pacha, then Governor of Syria, was highly charac- 
teristic of herself; without deigning to enter upon 
the subject of his letter, she directed her secretary 
to write — ' Consuls are for trade, not for the nobility.' 
The above meagre account will convey but a faint 
idea of this extraordinary woman, whose whole life 
was one continued romance; but it is all my memory 
enables me to give; and therefore, my dear Jesse, I 
must beg you to accept the will for the deed." 

In a subsequent letter, a reply to one in which 
I had requested a more exact description of Lady 
Hester's personal appearance, my kind correspondent 
says, " Her ladyship must have been a tall woman, 
but her male attire took off from her height; she was 
slight, well formed, and carried herself exceedingly 
well. The folds of her turban concealed her grey 
hairs; and the fairness of her complexion, the absence 
of beard, the brightness of her eye, and the vivacity 
of her expression, gave her the appearance of a young 
man, until a strong light betrayed the wrinkles which 


142 THE LIFE OF 

time never fails to engrave on the fairest face. Her 
enunciation was rapid and fluent; and when excited, 
her whole countenance seemed to light up, and she 
used her chibouque much in the same way that a 
Spanish lady would her fan — except that her gestures 
were more often those of command than entreaty. 
She rode as a man, and was always well armed." 

Such was my friend's clever outline of this singular 
woman, whose martial spirit and independent bearing 
remind us of those heroic ladies who, in ancient days, 
inhabited the banks of the Thermodon.1 

1 Those "heroic ladies" were the Amazons, a tribe of warlike 
women, who dwelt in Pontus, on the banks of the river Thermodon, 
and are said to have cut or burnt off their right breasts, and to have 
killed all their male children.

HAVING been able to collect only a few letters, 
written or received by Brummell before he left 
England, the most interesting substitute that I can 
offer in place of such materials is, extracts from his 
Album of the unpublished poetry of several of the 
most eminent characters of his time; indeed all the 
poetry subsequently given, is from that collection. 
This volume is a ponderous quarto, of plain vellum 
paper, and, though totally devoid of interior decoration, 
is, nevertheless, an example of his taste and extra- 
vagance; for the corners and clasps are of massive 
embossed silver gilt, like those on old missals, and 
the binding is dark-blue velvet. 

The velvet has long been faded, and the gilding is 
much worn, as if he had often meditated after his 
reverses over its well-stored pages; and though 
several blank leaves remain, it contains no fewer than 
two hundred and twenty-six pieces of poetry : the 


I44 THE LIFE OF 

choice of the subjects, and the manner in which they 
are treated, are not at all consistent with a worldly 
and selfish disposition; many of them are descriptive 
of the characteristics of childhood, in which certainly 
no one would suspect Beau Brummell of ever having 
interested himself; nor is the fact of the volume 
being such as he could with perfect propriety pre- 
sent to a lady, any trivial proof of his good taste. 

The whole seem to have been kept as they were 
sent to him, either in notes, or on loose scraps of 
paper, and carefully copied in at different periods; for 
they are arranged so exactly as to avoid turning over 
a page in any one of them, that did not require it on 
account of its length. This album is a little monu- 
ment of industry, the poetry is all inserted with his 
own hand, and the writing is remarkably neat; it 
might, indeed, challenge comparison with any lady's 
for elegance and regularity, with the advantage over 
modern penmanship, that it is as legible as printing. 

About six years before his death he presented this 
collection to her, whom he deemed most worthy of 
possessing his treasured memorial of times past, — a 
young lady from whose family he had received the 
greatest attention at Caen, and who had, by her wit and 
amiability, won the then old gentleman's heart.1 The 
following note accompanied it.

thing more dull to read, you may, perhaps, find some- 
thing in my old Album to yawn over, if it does not 
actually close your eyes; what it contains was written 
in other and happier days, and most of them were 
given to me by the authors themselves, long before 
their minor productions had assumed any other form 
than that of manuscript : such as the Duchess of 
Devonshire, poor Byron, Sheridanr and Lords Erskine 
and John Townshend — all now peacefully sleeping in 
their graves ! The principal part of those verses that 
are not recommended by the name being attached to 
them, are the namby-pamby compositions of an unfor- 
tunate person who shall be nameless, but whom you 
cut dead during the last several evenings, and who, 
in desperate consequence, has been measured for a 
winding-sheet this morning. — Always devoutly yours, 

" GEORGE BRUMMELL." 

By the Duchess of Devonshire, the first person to 
whom Brummell makes allusion in this letter, he seems 
to have been far more than tolerated, — he must have 
been liked; for it is scarcely probable that her Grace 
would have presented her own poetry to a person 
whom she did not think worthy of the compliment, 
and capable of appreciating it. But previously to 
laying the extracts I have selected before the reader, 
the following imperfect sketch of her character may 
not be altogether superfluous. Her Grace, the 
daughter of John, first Earl Spencer, was born on the 
9th of June 1757. Of her father's virtues we have 

VOL. I. K 


1 46 THE LIFE OF 

had sterling evidence in the tenor of his life, and the 
general esteem in which he was held; and these 
virtues the duke, his son-in-law, has feelingly comme- 
morated in his epitaph, which 

" Records the debt by love and duty paid." 

From her cradle Lady Georgiana Spencer gave 
promise of being unusually intellectual and beautiful; 
and her sensible and excellent mother, who was a 
daughter of Stephen Poyntz, Esq., bestowed the 
greatest care, and exercised the greatest judgment, on 
the cultivation of every principle and attainment that 
could improve either mind or body. Her success was 
complete as regarded the elegance of both; but her 
daughter's mind was by nature deficient in the strength 
and dignity on which such a woman would have 
wished to see her character based. She was enthu- 
siastic, but excessively volatile, and the combined 
temptations of rank, wealth, and beauty were too great 
not to have a ruinous effect; for when released from 
her mother's guidance, by her marriage with William, 
Duke of Devonshire, on the 6th of June 1774, at 
which time, observes Horace Walpole, " she was a 
lovely girl, natural, and full of grace," she was rapidly 
drawn headlong into the vortex of fashionable life. 

In palliation of this want of firmness, however, it 
should not be forgotten that she was but seventeen 
years of age, and, by an indulgent husband, placed in 
possession of the means of gratifying not only her 
wishes, but her whims. She thus became speedily 


Duchess of Devonshire 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 14? 

the authority for every idle fashion; her name was 
attached to every novelty in dress that she chose to 
adopt; and even the colour of her carriage was known, 
for some years after her death, as the " Devon- 
shire brown." Her beauty and the brilliancy of her 
career soon attracted crowds of flatterers, besides the 
admiration of the very superior men that her husband's 
political influence and opinions, good taste and hos- 
pitality, induced him to receive almost as constant 
visitors at Devonshire House. Distinguished among 
them, and distinguished indeed they were, compared 
with the wits and politicians of our days, were Fox, 
Wyndham, Burke, Tickell, Lord J. Townshend, Fitz- 
patrick, Sheridan, and others. The kind, the courted, 
and the witty Hare, — " the Hare of many friends," ] 
from whom a bow at the opera was considered a 
greater compliment than from the Prince of Wales, 
was also at the feet of the young and lovely duchess; 
and it was in concert with the duke that she thus 
lamented the death of this, their mutual friend in 1804. 

" Hark ! 'twas the knell of death — what spirit fled, 

And burst the shackles man is doom'd to bear? 
Can it be true, and 'midst the senseless dead, 

Must sorrowing thousands count the loss of Hare? 

Shall not his genius life's short date prolong, 

(Pure as the ether of its kindred sky), 
Shall wit enchant no longer from his tongue, 

And beam in vivid flashes from his eye? 

1 Mr. Hare, who died in 1804, was the son of a chemist at Winchester, 
and at Eton and Oxford the companion of Mr. Fox and his intimates, 
with whom he maintained till the close of his life an indissoluble friend- 
ship. He was considered one of the most accomplished and wittiest 
men of the day, and sate in parliament for Knaresborough until the 
time of his death. 


I4» THE LIFE OF 

Oh no ! — that mind, for every purpose fit, 
Has met, alas ! the universal doom; 

Unrivall'd fancy, judgment, sense, and wit, 
Were his, and only left him at the tomb. 

Rest, spirit, rest ! for gentle was thy course : 
Thy rays, like temper'd suns, no venom knew; 

For still benevolence allay'd the force 
Of the keen darts thy matchless satire threw. 

Yet not alone thy genius I deplore, 

Nor o'er thy various talents drop the tear; 

But weep to think I shall behold no more 
A loved companion and a friend sincere." 

Amongst such men as those I have mentioned, 
there must have been some who would never have 
been fascinated by a mere woman of fashion; no, it 
was the extent and variety of the Duchess of Devon- 
shire's intellectual acquirements, so far exceeding those 
of the generality of women in her time, that won their 
attentions. She was well read in the belles-lettres, 
and in the history and polity of most countries; she 
was also perfect mistress of the French and Italian 
languages, had both skill and taste in poetry, and 
could play upon the lyre. Indeed her mind, if we are 
to believe Wraxall,1 was far more gracefully modelled 

1 Sir Nathaniel William Wraxall, " Historical Memoirs of my own 
Time, 1815." We have already spoken of this gentleman in Chapter 
IV., and, when we quote him, have to add, "if we are to believe him," 
for his character for veracity was far from established. Thus the 
"Edinburgh Review," vol. xxx., in an article on these Memoirs, denies 
them all credit, and gives even the following epitaph of their author, 
written by a " young gentleman of Oxford : " 

" Men, Measures, scenes and facts, all 
Misquoting, mistating, 
Misplacing, misdating, 
Here lies Sir Nathaniel Wraxall." 

Lord Macaulay, in his essay "On Barrere," also states: "Among the 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 149 

than her person. He says, " The personal charms of 
the Duchess of Devonshire constituted her smallest 
pretension to universal admiration; nor did her beauty 
consist, like that of the Gunnings, in regularity of 
features, and faultless formation of limbs and shape; 
it lay in the amenity and graces of her deportment, 
in her irresistible manners, and the seduction of her 
society. Her hair was not without a tinge of red, and 
her face, though pleasing, yet had it not been illu- 
minated by her mind, might have been considered as 
an ordinary countenance. Descended in the fourth 
degree, lineally, from Sarah Jennings, the wife of John 
Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, she resembled the 
portraits of that beautiful woman." 

As, however, the Duchess was generally called 
then, and is so in our generation, " the beautiful 
duchess," it is scarcely possible to believe that her 
face, under any circumstances, could have been " con- 
sidered an ordinary countenance; " nor does the 
splendid portrait of her by Sir Joshua Reynolds give 
that impression : but, beautiful or not, she bewitched 
every one into believing that she was so, and speedily 
captivated a society so perfectly capable of appreciat- 
ing her, as that by which she was surrounded. 

numerous classes which make up the great genus Mendacium, the 
Mendacium Vasconicum, or Gascon lie, has during some centuries been 
highly esteemed as peculiarly circumstantial and peculiarly impudent; 
and among the Mendacia Vasconica, the Mendacium Barerianum is, 
without doubt, the finest species. It is indeed a superb variety, and 
quite throws into the shade some Mendacia, which we were used to 
regard with admiration. The Mendacium Wraxallanium, though by no 
means to be despised, will not sustain the comparison for a moment." 


ISO THE LIFE OF 

In doing the honours of her noble mansion, which 
was characterised by a splendour far greater than 
that of the court, her unusual accomplishments told 
with double effect; and their value to her guests was 
so enhanced by the natural fascination of her manners, 
that they soon looked with leniency upon her foibles. 
Tickell, in the " Wreath of Fashion," which had reached 
its sixth edition in 1780, wrote stanzas in honour of 
her petticoat; and Lord Carlisle, " a Rhapsody on 
seeing her Grace in full dress : " he also undertook to 
justify her caprices in the following lines : — 

" Wit is a feather, this we all admit, 
But sure each feather in your cap is wit; 
'Tis the best flight of genius — to improve 
The smiles of beauty and the bliss of love. 
Like beams around the sun your feathers shine, 
And raise the splendour of your charms divine; 
Such plumes the worth of mighty conquerors show, 
For who can conquer hearts so well as you? 
When on your head I see those fluttering things, 
I think, that love is there, and claps his wings. 
Feathers help'd Jove to fan his amorous flame, 
Cupid has feathers, angels wear the same. 
Since then from Heaven their origin we trace, 
Preserve the fashion — it becomes your Grace." 

Indeed there was scarcely a man of eminence in her 
day, who could write a stanza, that did not address 
some complimentary verses to her. Dr. Darwin, " that 
mighty master of unmeaning rhyme," sings her praises 
in his " Botanic Garden," and her friend, Charles Fox, 
did not think it beneath him to write some verses on the 
death of her favourite spaniel : they were in the album.

" ON THE DEATH OF FADDLE, A FAVOURITE SPANIEL OF 
GEORGIANA, DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE, WHO DIED AN 
EARLY VICTIM TO LOVE; HIS FATHER, FADDLE, SENIOR, 
HAVING PERISHED BY A SIMILAR FATE.— C. J. FOX. 

" Not Edward, when he saw with courage fell, 
The beaten foe beneath the stripling run, 
And, his career in Cressy's field begun, 
Did the black warrior's future fame foretell — 
Not great Pelides, when in that dark dell 
Of grisly Pluto, from Laertes' son 
He learnt the trophies by his Pyrrhus won, 
And stalk'd away, the proudest ghost in hell, 
More joy'd — than ancient Faddle's shade, when late 
The tidings through the grove of myrtle flew, 
That mighty Love had caused young Faddle's fate : 
Thus mortals, to their follies ever true, 
Of favourite passions would extend the date, 
And, in their offspring, love or fight anew ! " 

But all this homage is not surprising. In her 
youth the Duchess must have been, in spite of 
Wraxall's allusion to red hair, a lovely woman; for, 
when she was about six-and-thirty, two years after 
the Doctor botanised her, she held no mean position 
in the following amusing estimate of the personal 
attractions of our then reigning beauties. This 
arbitrary mode of estimating the comparative merits 
of individuals, was the invention of Akenside, who 
first applied it to poets; and the plan, whether well 
or ill executed, in the present instance, is a far more 
complete one than Lord Byron's pyramid, or rather 
Isosceles' triangle, of which the Pleasures of Memory 
form the apex. The point of perfection is twenty : —

156 THE LIFE OF 

The history of the Hon. Mrs. Bouverie's domestic 
life, the mother of the beautiful Lady Erskine St. Clair 
here mentioned, is perhaps one of the most remark- 
able to be found in Debrett. She was a daughter of 
Sir E. Fawkener, Ambassador to the Porte, and the 
friend of Voltaire, and in June 1764, when only 
fifteen, married the Hon. E. Bouverie. Having lived 
with him twenty-two years, or more (for their eighth 
child was born in 1786), she then placed herself under 
the protection of Lord Robert Spencer, son of Charles, 
second Duke of Marlborough, to whom she was not 
married till 1811, a year after the death of her first 
husband. It is said that Mrs. Bouverie was a very 
attractive and engaging woman, and that her conduct 
when living with Lord Robert, who was very constant 
to her, was in other respects so amiable and exem- 
plary, that it elicited from Charles Fox the paradoxical 
remark, that " they made adultery respectable." He 
also wrote the following most extraordinary quatrain 
upon her, which I found in Brummell's collection : — 

" She loves truth, though she lies till she's black in the face; 
She loves virtue, though none in her conduct you trace; 
Her delicate feelings all wickedness shocks, 
Though her lover's Lord Robert, and her friend is Charles 
Fox!" 

Lady R. Spencer died in November 1825, and his 
lordship in June 1831. Mr. Bouverie was an uncle 
of the well-known Dr. Pusey, whose father first 
assumed that name : it is curious, but the Doctor is 
of a family descended from Protestant refugees !

table — The Duchess's Kindness of Heart — Her Enthusiasm — The 
Contest for Westminster in 1784 — Anecdotes of and Sqitibs let off at

Gothard" — Her Knoivledge of French and Italian — Her Translation 
of one of Petrarch's Sonnets. 

IN the short space of three years after her marriage, 
the Duchess of Devonshire's extravagance became the 
subject of public criticism, and several pamphlets were 
addressed to her, reflecting severely upon her con- 
duct; the motto of one was, " Pleased with a feather, 
tickled with a straw," — alluding to Lord Carlisle's 
verses: that of another was also from Pope, " She sighs, 
and is no Duchess at her heart," and both of these 
were very severe. But long after this period, having 
been fifteen years devoted to pleasure, she was still 
foremost in every fashionable folly; and, in 1793, was 
at the head of the Lady Patronesses of the celebrated 
pic-nic parties. There is, however, every reason to 
fear, that her Grace's excessive extravagance was not 
her worst fault; not only from traditional report, but 
from the evidence that may be met with in every auto- 


158 THE LIFE OF 

graph collection, we learn that the Duchess was devoted 
to faro,1 the fashionable game of the day, and other 
games of chance, which brought her into positions 
greatly detrimental to her character, and the dignity 
of her high station. In this she certainly was not 
discouraged, either by her male or female friends, and 
gaming in private circles was then far more common 
than in the present day; though, unfortunately, the 
vice is not extinct, and fashionable women of rank 
might now be named, who play as deep as did then 
her Grace of Devonshire. 

It was, indeed, one of the characteristic follies of 
" All the Talents; " the absorbing passion of several 
members of the party who were most intimate at 
Devonshire House. The devotion of Fox to play is 
notorious, and he seems to have been scarcely able to 
pass forty-eight hours without it. A gentleman, now 
living, informed me, that one evening, when he and 
two or three other friends of Mrs. Fox were drinking 
tea with her in South Street, the door opened, and 
Charles James came skipping into the room, in most 
unusual spirits; they were on the point of inquiring 

1 Frao was a game of cards, in which one person held the 
bank, and an indefinite number of players staked their money 
on one of the fifty-two cards of the pack. The dealer dealt two cards 
for himself from another pack; one on the right for himself, and one on 
the left for the punters; and, of course, the highest was the winning 
card. Besides this, the dealer had certain advantages. The name 
Faro is said to have been derived from the name of the ancient Kings 
of Egypt, a representation of a Pharaoh having been depicted on one 
of the cards. It was first introduced into France by the Venetian 
Ambassador in the year 1674.

the cause, but he saved them the trouble, by exclaim- 
ing, as he continued his capers, which he cut all 
round the room, " Great run ! great run ! vingt-et-un; 
lucky dog; to-morrow morning pay the Jews — pay 
them all ! " Unfortunately for him, and for them too, 
it was Friday night, which, in the excess of his 
honesty and happiness, he did not think of. Of 
course, the next day no Israelite would come for his 
cash; — and that night the monies were carried to the 
Club, and there lost — the love of powerful excitement, 
and the insatiable cravings of the gamester's heart, 
overcoming that great man's better feelings, and good 
but transient resolutions. 

But, though a slave to this dreadful passion, and 
therefore to its degrading consequences, he wrote the 
following curious description of the gaming-table, in 
which the political feelings of this constitutional states- 
man are singularly interwoven with the subject, and 
in terms that would scarcely be agreeable to, or in 
accordance with, the opinions of the Whigs, in these 
days of the march of opinion. The critical powers of 
Fox, however, on points relating either to history or 
historians, generally led him to just conclusions; and 
his denunciation of Cromwell, though on so trifling an 
occasion, is made in a spirit as liberal as that of his 
remark on the partiality of Hume and Gibbon, for 
their respective and favourite opinions : namely, " that 
one so loved a king, and the other so hated a priest, 
that neither of them could be depended upon, when 
either a priest or a king was concerned." 


160 THE LIFE OF 

These lines by Fox were copied from the Beau's 
album, and I believe have never been published : — 

THE GAMING-TABLE. 

" A spot there is, say, Traveller, where it lies, 
And mark the clime, the limits and the size, 
Where grow no trees, nor waves the golden grain, 
Nor hills, nor vales, diversify the plain; 
Eternal years without the farmer's toil, 
Through all the seasons clothe the favour'd soil; 
Fair pools, in which the finny race abound, 
By human hands prepared, enrich the ground — 
Not Indian coasts produce an ampler store, 
Pearls, ivory, diamonds, gold and silver ore : 
Yet, Britons ! envy not these wealthy climes, 
Perpetual war distracts and endless crimes 
Pollute the soil; pale Avarice triumphs there, 
Hate, Envy, Rage, and heart-destroying Care; 
With Fraud and Fear, and comfortless Despair. 
Their government not long remains the same, 
Though they, like us, revere a monarch's name; 
Now Cromwell-like, a low and base-born knave, 
Nobles, and Kings and Queens presumes to brave : 
The nobles fall — the king's a captive slave. 
Britons, beware — let Avarice tempt no more — 
Spite of its wealth, avoid the fatal shore." 

But to return to the Duchess. Though she played 
high and all her amusements were of an expensive 
character, and her love of dissipation became so strong 
that she never deliberately improved her habits of life, 
yet she constantly gave remarkable instances of gene- 
rosity and kind feeling; being in that respect, as she 
was in everything else, a creature of impulse, she 
yielded without discrimination to the supplications of 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 161 

distress, as easily as she did to the temptations of 
luxury, and those pleasures, which her success and 
influence in society induced. She liberally assisted 
literary characters, and especially protected Charlotte 
Smith, the novelist,1 who, at one period of her life, 
lived at Devonshire House : but the most pleasing 
trait of her domestic character was the example she 
set her fashionable friends by nursing her own 
children; thereby discouraging the unnatural practice 
prevalent in her time, of sending them into the country 
and leaving them to the management and discretion of 
ignorant, and sometimes unfeeling nurses. A poet of 
the day thus refers to this incident : — 

" So when the mother bending o'er his charms, 
Clasps her fair nursling in delighted arms, 
Throws the thin kerchief from her neck of snow, 
And half unveils the pearly orbs below, — 
With sparkling eye the blameless plunderer owns 
Her soft embraces, and endearing tones; 
Sucks the salubrious fount with open lips, 
Spreads his inquiring hands, and smiles and sips." 

The interest which the Duchess of Devonshire took 
in public affairs was far beyond what had ever been 
displayed by any of her female contemporaries. When 
the American War broke out, she was seen at Tiptree 
and Warley Camps, dressed in the regimentals of the 
Derby Militia. The consequence was a military fever 
amongst the women, which was followed by a naval 

1 Charlotte Smith published several poems and novels from the year 
1791 until the year 1802, of which a few enjoyed some reputation, but 
are now buried in oblivion.

one, when the victories of Howe, Jervis, Duncan, and 
Nelson revived the national spirits; and the Egyptian, 
Aboukir, and Nelson bonnets, caps, and head-dresses 
were all the fashion. On the declaration of war being 
made against France, she set to work with all her 
friends to make flannel waistcoats for the troops; and 
she showed the same enthusiasm in the cause of her 
friend Charles Fox, in his great contest for West- 
minster in 1784, which appropriately enough com- 
menced on " All Fools' Day; " and, being in the 
" good old times," lasted for one month and seventeen 
days. 

The excitement which this election caused amongst 
all grades of society, was never exceeded in the most 
turbulent republics. The most refined ladies quite 
forgot all propriety of demeanour, and some of the 
highest rank actually pulled the favours from each 
other's bosoms in the opera refreshment-rooms, ac- 
companying the action with screams of " No Fox ! no 
Fox ! " Even at Carlton House, election jokes were 
permitted, and at the breakfast given by the Prince of 
Wales on this occasion, some one pinned a Fox cockade 
on the head of Lady Talbot, who was a violent Tory; 
for some time her Ladyship did not perceive it, but a 
tell-tale mirror at length revealed the affront, when 
the favour was removed with no gentle hand, and not 
only indignantly thrown at her feet, but stamped upon 
— to the great amusement of the bystanders. 

But no one was so devoted to the interest of the 
popular candidate or the success of his cause as the 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 163 

Duchess of Devonshire, who was then figuratively 
called, and is still distinguished by the appellation of, 
" Fox's Duchess." Accompanied by her sister, Lady 
Duncannon, and her friend the Duchess of Rutland, 
she attended continually at the hustings in an elegant 
equipage with a favour in her hat, and one on her 
breast, inscribed with the word " Fox," — and sup- 
ported by the presence of her scarcely less fascinating 
sister, she visited the houses and shops of the electors 
and dazzled and enslaved them by her enchanting 
manners, her beauty, and the influence of her high 
rank; nor did she object to convey the humblest of 
the electors in her own carriage to the hustings to 
vote for her friend. 

But the most convincing proof of her ardour in 
his cause, is the well-authenticated story, that rather 
than lose a plumper for her candidate, she permitted a 
butcher, — a man probably surrounded at the time with 
slaughtered beeves and fat southdowns, to kiss her in 
Newport Market ! Of course, this enthusiasm called 
forth philippics from the Tories, and the greatest 
admiration from the Whigs; but what it called forth 
from the Duke, her husband, has not transpired. To 
excuse this kiss one of her party quoted Dean Swift, 
who says, " that an over-nice man is a man of nasty 
ideas; " and another compared her to Cornelia, the 
wife of Pompey, and daughter of Metellus Scipio. In 
an account of this memorable election, which filled a 
thickly printed quarto volume of eight hundred pages, 
published by Debrett, a few months after, there are 


164 THE LIFE OP 

one hundred and thirty squibs and pieces of poetry 
from the wits and versifiers of both sides. The follow- 
ing are specimens of their powers, and the compliments 
paid to her Grace : — 

" Fair Devon all good English hearts must approve, 

And the Waldegraves,1 God bless their sweet faces ! 
The Duchess she looks the sweet Queen of Love, 
And they like the three sister Graces. 
Then let each of us say, 
May the D — 1 take Wray, 
And Charley and Liberty carry the day. 

" E'en cobblers she canvass'd, they would not refuse, 
But huzza'd for Fox and ' No wooden shoes.' 
She canvass'd the tailors, and ask'd for their votes, 
They all gave her plumpers, and cried, ' No turncoats.' J 
Then let each of us say, £c." 

But would a canvasser like her Grace be so suc- 
cessful in these degenerate days of " pounds, shillings, 
and pence," in which the very ghost of chivalry has 
been hunted from the land? Could she still find in 
Newport Market a butcher who would prefer a kiss 
to a ten-pound note? I fear not. It was during the 
excitement and turmoil of this election that the flatter- 
ing and well-known exclamation burst spontaneously

Waldegrave; 

Charlotte Maria, afterwards Duchess of Grafton; 
Hannah Horatia, afterwards Lady Hugh Seymour. All three 

daughters of the 2nd Earl of Waldegrave. 

" The Ladies Waldegrave," writes Dr. Warner to George Selwyn, in 
June 1779, "have been about marrying the whole town, but are not 
married. Lord Egremont was very near, but he said he should hang 
himself before the summer was over if he did."

from the lips of the impassioned coalheaver, who, 
roused by her expressive countenance, said, while 
gazing with admiration upon it, " I could light my 
pipe at your eyes." This compliment was highly 
appreciated by the Duchess, and she always admitted 
it as the most gratifying one that had ever been paid 
her. 

Though this celebrated woman devoted herself 
heart and soul to politics, and the gaieties and dissi- 
pation of the sphere of life in which she moved, she 
was capable of enjoying pleasures of a very different 
character; for on her return from Italy, in the autumn 
°f T793> to which country she had gone with her. 
mother and Lady Bessborough, on account of the 
delicate health of the latter, the passage of the St. 
Gothard suggested to her the pleasing little poem of 
that name, the opening of which is an apostrophe to 
the lovely land she was leaving. A natural benevo- 
lence and warmth of feeling pervade this poem; the 
stirring points in Swiss history are evidently dwelt 
upon with energy and admiration; nor is the descrip- 
tive part wanting in beauty, simplicity, and strength. 
Her Grace, with maternal feeling, dedicated it to her 
children; and perhaps the prettiest quotation to make 
from it is the concluding stanza, in which she thus 
addresses them : 

" Hope of my life ! dear children of my heart ! 

That anxious heart, to each fond feeling true, 
To you still pants each pleasure to impart, 
And more — oh ! transport, reach its home and you." 


1 66 THE LIFE OF 

Soon after this poem was published it was trans- 
lated into French by the Abbe" Delille, a member of 
the French Academy, and author of " Les Jardins," 
who was probably an emigrant friend of hers. When 
the Duchess presented him with this specimen of her 
poetical powers, she sent with it the following com- 
plimentary lines : — 

A MONSIEUR 1' ABBE DELILLE. , 

Vous dont la lyre enchanteresse 

Unit la force a la douceur, 

De la nature amant flatteur; 
Vous qui 1'embellissez sans cesse, 
J'ose vous offrir en tremblant 

De 1'humble pre" la fleur nouvelle; 

Je la voudrais une immortelle, 
Si vous acceptez le present. 

GEORGINE DEVONSHIRE.1 

Though these couplets are in themselves trifling, yet 
they show that her Grace was, as I have before 
remarked, a perfect mistress of French; but the 
following translation of Petrarch's thirty-fourth sonnet 

1 These lines are evidently imitated from the well-known quatrain 
which Desmarets de St Sorlin wrote for the violet, one of the sixteen 
flowers constituting the poetical portion of the celebrated Guirlande de 
Julie, painted by the artist Robert, each of which addressed itself in 
verse by the mouth of various poets to the fair Julie d'Angennes, to 
whom this garland was offered in 1641 as a homage by her future 
husband the Duke de Montausier. The quatrain of St. Sorlin is as 
follows : — 

" Modeste en ma couleur, modeste en mon sejour, 
Franche d'ambition je me cache sous 1'herbe; 
Mais si sur votre front je puis me voir un jour, 
La plus humble des fleur s sera la plus superb e." 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 167 

is a far more remarkable instance of her proficiency in 
the Italian language, an accomplishment which her 
friend Charles Fox also possessed. This the reader 
may see in his " II piacere e il Desire," an imitation 
of Monk Lewis's poem, " In yonder bower lies Plea- 
sure sleeping," which is printed in the edition of 
"Dark Musgrave's " poems, published in 1812. The 
friend who was kind enough to send me a copy of 
this translation by her Grace, is perhaps better able 
to appreciate the merits of Italian literature than any 
Englishman now living. He gave me also some 
details of the circumstances under which it came into 
his possession, and I now insert them in his own 
words'. 

" My first visit to the Eternal City was in 1822, 
and it was there that I had the pleasure of making 
the acquaintance of Elizabeth, Duchess of Devonshire. 
Knowing that one of my objects was, to investigate 
certain controverted points in the life of Petrarch, she 
very kindly assisted me in my researches; and one 
morning, whilst we were engaged in discussing the 
nature of his attachment to Laura, she presented me 
with the translation of ' Levommi il mio pensier/ as a 
specimen of the poetical talents of her predecessor 
Georgiana, and a striking proof of the facility with 
which the English language, when properly handled, 
Venders the sublimity and tenderness of the great 
lyrical poet of Italy." As the reader may like to com- 
pare it with the Italian, I have given the original 
with it.

Deh perche tacque ed allargb la mano?

TRANSLATED BY GEORGIANA, DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE 

In spirit I had mounted to the sphere 

Where she amidst its gentle inmates beam'd, 
Whom still I fondly seek, but found not here : 

More beautiful and less severe she seem'd. 
She press'd my hand, and said, "In this bright star 

With me, if hope deceive not, thou shall dwell : 
That maid I am who caused thy live-long war, 

And closed her day of life ere evening fell. 

1 // terzo cerchio. Si finge rapito al terzo cielo, luogo assegnato dai. 
Peeti agli amanti virtuosi e casti. 

* Mio ben non cape, ac. 1' intelletto umano non e capace di com- 
prendere la pienezza della mia felicita. 

' Te solo aspetto e il mio bel velo (il corpo), cioe, quello che tu Unto 
amasti e ch'e rimaso laggiuso sulla terra. — Commentator's Note, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 169 

My bliss transcends the reach of human mind : 
Thee only I desire, and what thou prized'st so much, 

Those beauteous spoils, I left on earth behind." 

Why ceased she, why withdrew the pledge thus given? 
That chaste, that thrilling voice, that holy touch, 

Had sure sufficed to keep my soul in heaven !

No doubt many other examples of Georgiana, Duchess 
of Devonshire's, taste and acquirements exist in the 
domestic archives of Chatsworth; but though they 
were not accessible to me, I trust I have in some 
degree succeeded in my attempt to awaken the reader's 
interest in the lovely authoress of the fugitive poetry 
that I now transcribe from Brummell's album, and 
which, after diligent search, I have not discovered in 
print. The first piece gives ample evidence of her 
classical taste, and the richness and elegance of her 
imagination. 

" Here, in the bower of beauty, newly shorn, 
Let Fancy sit, and sing how Love was born; 
Wrapt up in roses, Zephyr found the child 
In Flora's cheek, when first the goddess smiled; 
Nursed on the bosom of the beauteous Spring, 
O'er her white breast he spread his purple wing. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. ijt 

On kisses fed, and silver drops of dew, 
The little wanton into Cupid grew; 
Then arm'd his head with glittering sparks of fire, 
And tipp'd his shining arrows with desire. 
Hence joys arose upon the wings of wind, 
And Hope presents the lover always kind; 
Despair creates a rival for our fears, 
And tender Pity softens into tears." 

The stanzas that follow are not so imaginative, but 
more natural, and on that account, more pleasing. 

" My cherish'd hope, my fondest dream, 

Still, dearest ! rests on thee; 
A blank without thee all would seem, 
And life would lifeless be. 

The place thy presence glads to seek 

Is where I'm ever best; 
And when I hear thee kindly speak, 

And speak to me^ I'm blest. 

But should hard fate command it so, 

Still, dearest ! I'm resign'd; 
And if from me thou'rt bent to go, 

Or alter'd, or unkind, — 

Unfelt by thee, my silent care 

Shall never claim relief; 
And still I'll wish thou may'st not share 

My solitary grief." 

In the next, the Duchess seems to have adopted 
the metre of Alonzo the Brave and the Fair Imogene, 
of M. G. Lewis. 

The hero of this ballad was Lord Morley, then 
Lord Boringdon, who was a strong supporter of Mr. 
Pitt, and when a young man, spoke frequently in the 


172 THE LIFE OF 

House of Lords. It is probably to these speeches 
that her Grace alludes, which no doubt found but 
little favour in the eyes of such an ardent Foxite as 
she was. Of the ladies that the youthful Lord Bor- 
ingdon jilted, the author has no gossiping details to 
give; but of the one who jilted him the Peerage 
gives due information, and shows that these verses 
were written previously to the 24th of June, 1804, 
on which day he married the Lady Augusta Fane, 
second daughter of John, tenth Earl of Westmore- 
land; which marriage was dissolved in 1809, when 
her ladyship re-married the late Right Honourable 
Sir Arthur Paget. Lord Morley died on the 1 4th 
March 1840.' 

BORING THE BRAVE. 

" A baron so bold, and of parentage fair, 

Was riding beside the green sea; 
His vizor was up, and his forehead was bare, 
His face it was comely, and long was his hair, 

And tall, and full portly was he. 

He slowly rode on, 'twas for exercise' sake, 

Nor trotted, nor canter'd did he; 

He mused on the speeches he'd made, and would make, 
Of the vows to fair damsels he'd keep or would break, 

And on many a quaint repartee. 

Oh ! from him let the barons of England beware 

How their loves and their palfreys they guide; 
Many women may love them, for whom they don't care, 
Many horses may stumble, unless they're aware, 
Or if loose in their stirrups they ride. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 173 

A Bedlamite Duchess1 was bathing hard by, 

When she saw the young Paladin pass; 
He bewildered her brain, and he dazzled her eye, 
Her guides could not stop her, she strove to rush by, 
And swore that she would, ' by the mass ! ' 

The baron was frighten'd, with reason and truth, 

For her love and her frenzy were strong; 
She turn'd as he turn'd, and with gesture uncouth, 
Her arms she elongated straight at the youth, 
And they seem'd to be half a mile long. 

He spoke not, he flew not, he only could scream, 

When plump in the water he fell ! 
And lo ! all this bustle, though strange it may seem, 
He found by awaking was only a dream, 

Was a very good story to tell. 

And now still at midnight, the supper just o'er, 

Her spirit he seems to behold; 
The story he told, though he told it before, 
For each night, as the clock strikes, he tells it once more, 

And forgets it has ever been told ! " 

The following ballad is another quiz upon the 
same nobleman, for which reason I have placed it 
with the preceding one : it was written by George 
Ellis, another of Brummell's friends, and is in some 
measure a parody on Monk Lewis's ballad of Duran- 
darte and Belerma : — 

" Sad and fearful is the story 
Of the Roncesvalles fight." 

It was written when Mr. Ellis was on a visit to his 
cousin, Baron Seaford. Brooksby Hall is on the 
road from Melton to Leicester. 

1 Quere, her Grace of Gordon? 


174 THE LIFE OF 

" Sad and fearful is the story 

Of the hunt in Leicestershire, 
On that fatal field of glory 

Met full many a dashing squire. 

There fell bold Borino, never 
Horse did such a baron bear, 

Thinking he could ride for ever, 
Mounted on so dun a mare. 

Scarlet spencer deck'd his shoulders, 
Of his coat the skirts were blue; 

Pantaloons charm'd all beholders, 
Leather, and of yellow hue. 

Huge his hat, to put his head in, 
Longer queue was never seen; 

Round his neck his 'kerchief spreading, 
Check'd with faded blue and green. 

Leaps he thought were quite delightful, 
Hedge and ditch, what'er might hap, 

Even gates were not too frightful, 
Leap he would, — and chose a gap. 

O'er the gap the dun mare vaulted, 
Glow'd with joy his noble blood; 

Pass'd the gap, the dun mare halted, — 
Dropp'd the Baron in the mud ! 

1 Although young I fall, believe me,' 
Cried this lord, of noble mind, 

' Think not, sirs, a fall would grieve me, 
'Tis to fall before we find : 

1 Comforts twain my griefs have lighten'd, 
Though your grooms have seen me down; 

First I prove I was not frighten'd, 
Next, the spencer's not my own.' 


BE A U BR VMM ELL. i 7 5 

Laugh'd the grooms, the farmers hearty, 
Laugh'd the huntsman till he cried; 

Laugh'd each sportsman of the party, 
' Good, my lord, thus ever ride.' 

Baron, bolder, wiser, graver, 

(RidingfSpanish, sure to fall), 
Lord in scarlet spencer, braver 

Started ne'er from Brooksby Hall." 

Perhaps no one ever better united the character 
of a gentleman with that of a man of letters than the 
author of this humorous scrap, which is valuable as 
the trifle of a very superior man. Mr. Ellis was a 
person of gentle and polished manners, and his mind 
was peculiarly formed to feel and inspire others with 
the warmest sentiments of friendship. Mr. Lockhart, 
in speaking of the intimacy that existed between this 
talented individual and Sir Walter Scott, calls him 
the " elegant and amiable Ellis; " and that he was 
amiable there is little reason to doubt, for he was the 
friend of the great and good Heber, who introduced 
Scott to his acquaintance. The intimacy thus formed 
between Sir Walter and Mr. Ellis lasted for many 
years, indeed until the death of the latter; for besides 
the many social qualities which they possessed in 
common, their great taste for national antiquarian lore, 
and deep knowledge of this particular study, were 
subjects of mutual interest; and when in London the 
great novelist always reserved Saturday and Sunday 
for a visit to Sunning Hill, the residence of his friend. 
Dr. Leyden, Sir Walter Scott's amanuensis and assist- 


I76 THE LIFE OF 

ant, also paid him a visit there, and thus described 
his countenance in a letter to his patron : — 

" His even graye as glas ben 
And his looks ben alto kene, 
Loveliche to paramour; 
Brown as acorn ben his faxe, 
His face is thin as bettel axe, 
That dealeth dintis doure." 

This grotesque sketch by the enthusiastic lover of old 
English verse does not convey to the mind of the 
unlearned any other idea than that of a rusty battle- 
axe, — a very moat-drawbridge-and-portcullis cast of 
countenance. In the early part of Mr. Ellis's career 
he was, like Burke, a Whig, and contributed his share 
of satires to the Rolliad and Probationary Odes; but 
in 1779 he changed his political opinions, a circum- 
stance rather more unusual in those days than in the 
present; and after he became the coadjutor of Canning 
and Frere, he wrote as ardently and well, and praised 
Mr. Pitt as cleverly, in the Anti-Jacobin, as he had 
abused him in the opposition periodicals. 

" Pert without fire, without experience sage," 

was the opening line of one of his gibes against that 
minister; but though engaged in the literary warfare 
of the pen in early life, Mr. Ellis was not afflicted 
with the odious asperity which frequently results from 
that occupation, or from entering actively upon the 
arena of politics. 

His literary claims to our admiration and respect 
rest, however, upon more solid and commendable 


BE A U BR UMMELL. 1 7 7 

grounds than his political versification. His writing 
has been compared to Addison's for purity, and his 
Essay on the Formation and Progress of the English 
Language, his antiquarian knowledge, and contribu- 
tions to the Quarterly Review, of which he was one 
of the earliest supporters, will remain, and be prized as 
the evidence of his talent, long after the remembrance 
of his social accomplishments has passed away. Mr. 
Ellis also wrote some light poetry, of which he limited 
the publicity to circulation amongst his intimate friends. 
In the latter years of this gentleman's life he was much 
harassed by a painful disease, which he bore with pati- 
ence and fortitude, and expired at Sunninghill on the 
i8th of April 1815, in the seventieth year of his age. 

There are several other pieces of the Duchess of 
Devonshire's poetry in Brummell's collection besides 
the preceding ones; amongst them are some lines on 
a bust of Charles J. Fox at Woburn, The battle of 
Aboukir, and her celebrated Negro Song, " The loud 
wind roared, the rain fell fast," which was suggested 
by^a circumstance that befell Mungo Parke during his 
travels in Africa, and which was set to music many 
years ago. There is also an excellent specimen of 
her Grace's wit and domestic satire; but as the joke 
on which it turns was taken up by Lord John Town- 
shend, I have placed it with his reply. 

The following are her lines on the bust of Charles 
James Fox at Woburn : — 

" Here, 'midst the friends he loved, the man behold, 

In truth unshaken, and in virtue bold; 
VOL. I. M 


178 THE LIFE OF 

Whose patriot zeal and uncorrupted mind 
Dared to assert the freedom of mankind : 
And, whilst extending desolation far, 
Ambition spread the baneful flames of war, 
Fearless of blame, and eloquent to save, 
'Twas he, — 'twas Fox, the warning counsel gave; 
'Midst jarring conflicts stemm'd the tide of blood, 
And to the menaced world a landmark stood. 
Oh ! had his voice in Mercy's cause prevail'd, 
What grateful millions had the statesman hail'd ! 
Whose wisdom made the broils of nations cease, 
And taught the world humanity and peace. 
But though he fail'd, succeeding ages here, 
The vain yet pious effort shall revere; 
Boast in their annals his illustrious name, 
Uphold his greatness, and confirm his fame." 

The succeeding stanzas, on account of their pecu- 
liar beauty and pathos, I have reserved for the last, 
in order that the impression they will naturally make 
upon the reader, may not be impaired by any subse- 
quent trifle from the same pen. 

" I've known all the blessings of sight, 

The beauties that nature displays, 
And traced in the splendour of light 

The glories that stream'd in the blaze; 
Yet though darkness its sorrows has spread, 

I grudge not the pleasures I've known, 
Since, reclining, I thus lay my head 

On a breast that I know is my own. 

I have valued the charms of the rose, 
As I pluck'd it all fresh from the tree; 

I have kiss'd it, and bid it disclose 
Its sweets, for I meant it for thee. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 179 

But memory still has its bliss, 

Though no longer I gaze on thee now; 

More sweet than the rose is thy kiss, 
And more fresh and more lovely art thou. 

The life of the roebuck was mine, 

As I bounded o'er valley and lawn, 
I watch'd the grey twilight decline, 

And worshipp'd the day-breaking l dawn. 
I regret not the freedom of will, 

Or sigh as uncertain I tread, 
I am freer and happier still 

When by thee I am carefully led. 

Ere my sight I was doom'd to resign 

My heart I surrender'd to thee, 
Not a thought or an action was mine, 

But I saw as thou bad'st me to see. 
Thy watchful affection I wait, 

And hang with delight on thy voice; 
And dependence is soften'd by fate, 

Since dependence on thee was my choice." 

These verses speak eloquently for a heart that the 
blandishments of fashion beguiled to a lamentable 
extent, but could never entirely corrupt. " To her 
rricVther," says Wraxall, " the Duchess of Devonshire 
was attached with more than common filial affection, 
of which she exhibited pecuniary proofs, rarely given 
by a daughter to a parent. Nor did she display less 
attachment to her sister, Lady Duncannon." It is 
said, that in her last illness, the retrospect of her life 
caused the Duchess of Devonshire the deepest regret, 
and that she felt acutely the utter insignificance and 

1 Day-breaking, Qy. *' gay- breaking." 


i8o THE LIFE OF 

emptiness of the pleasures which had so constantly 
absorbed her mind and energies. The disorder which 
terminated in her death was an abscess in the liver; 
her Grace having experienced the first attack of it 
about three months before, while dining at the Mar- 
quis of Hertford's; from that time it increased so 
rapidly, as to baffle every attempt made to subdue it, 
by the combined talents of Doctors Baillie, Pitcairn, 
and others. Her disease was beyond the aid of 
human skill; and she expired at Devonshire House, 
on the morning of the 3Oth of March 1806, in the forty- 
ninth year of her age. 

The Prince of Wales had the greatest regard and 
respect for her, and expressed a wish to attend her 
funeral; but the honour was declined, as in London 
the ceremonials were conducted with great privacy. 
This, however, was not the case at Derby, for the 
hearse was met three miles from the town by the 
nobility and gentry of the county, and the Duke's 
tenantry, who accompanied it to the family vault of 
the Cavendishes, in All Saints' Church. Fifteen years 
after her sister, the Countess of Bessborough, was, at 
her own request, laid in the same vault. In the zenith 
of their beauty and influence, " the rival sisters," as 
they were generally called, were tenderly attached to 
each other; and how this feeling survived in Lady 
Bessborough's mind, is attested by an affecting anec- 
dote, which Wraxall thus relates : — 

"During the month of July 1811, a very short 
time before the decease of the late Duke of Devonshire, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 181 

I visited the vault in the principal church of Derby, 
where repose the remains of the Cavendish family. 
As I stood contemplating the coffin which contained 
the remains of that admired female, Georgiana, the 
late Duchess, the woman who accompanied me pointed 
out the relics of a bouquet which lay on the coffin, 
nearly collapsed into dust. ' That nosegay,' said she, 
'was brought here by the Countess of Bessborough, 
who had designed to place it with her own hands on 
her sister's coffin; but overcome by her emotions on 
approaching the spot, she found herself unable to 
descend the steps conducting to the vault. In an 
agony of grief she knelt down on the stones, as 
nearly over the place occupied by the corpse as I 
could direct, and there deposited the flowers, enjoining 
me the performance of an office to which she was un- 
equal. I fulfilled her wishes.' " When the Prince of 
Wales was informed of the death of the Duchess of 
Devonshire, he is said to have exclaimed, " Then we 
have lost the best-bred woman in England ! " And 
,Fox observed, on the same melancholy occasion, " She 
had the kindest of human hearts." How characteristic 
the remarks of the two men ! 

A few days after the first edition of this work was 
published (1844), a visit to Breadsall Priory, near 
Derby, gave me an opportunity of seeing the vault of 
the Cavendishes in All Saints' Church. The morning 
prayers on a week day enabled me to enter this edifice, 
which is of handsome proportions, and, as Wraxall 
observes, " the principal church; " but it required 


1 82 THE LIFE OF 

some little persuasion to induce the sexton to allow me 
to look on the remains of " the once rival sisters," no 
longer so in the dark tomb. The unwillingness of the 
official to do so arose, as he afterwards informed me, 
from some restrictions which had been placed upon 
him in consequence of his predecessor having habi- 
tually stuck his tallow candle on the coffin of the first 
Duke, when showing visitors the vault. The traces 
of the guttering dip had been observed by the present 
Duke, who gave an order that the keys of the mau- 
soleum should for the future be kept at the under- 
taker's. They were procured from his house, which 
is in the neighbourhood, and the sexton having lighted 
a candle, we descended. The vault is on the right of 
the chancel, the steps leading to it being in a pew that 
is used by the inmates of the Almshouses which were 
founded by the celebrated Countess of Devonshire. 
This staircase is commodious, and the entrance to it 
by the wooden trap-door large enough to admit one 
person easily. The vault itself is divided into two 
chambers, which are, as the passage, so well ventilated, 
that very little damp was discernible. Each of these 
apartments is divided into a series of oblong cavities, 
dug horizontally within the wall, into which the coffins 
are laid. Those in the second chamber, which is 
quite full, are the oldest; and some of them not unlike 
an Egyptian mummy in form, being in fact nothing 
more than a lead covering which was made to take 
the shape of the body. Most of these coffins are in 
an extraordinary state of preservation; one, however, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 183 

had a hole in it sufficiently large to show the skull of a 
certain Earl of Devonshire who died in 1670; another, 
and a much older coffin near it, leaked, but the liquid 
which exuded from it had no unpleasant smell, and 
was originally probably of an aromatic nature. The 
fragments of the external wooden coffins appeared to 
have been collected together with great care, and were 
piled up in two or three of the uppermost niches. 
The coffin of Georgiana, in the chamber near the door, 
was easily recognised by the initials G. D. on the 
external end. It lay in a direct line with that of her 
sister, Lady Bessborough, which is in the inner apart- 
ment; so that the extremities of the two coffins would 
touch, were it not for the wall between. I understood 
that they were placed in this position by Lady 
Bessborough's express desire. The faded gilding, the 
tattered velvet of rich crimson, and the tinsel ducal 
crowns that rested on the coffins of these two bright 
spirits of the fashionable world, were mournful but 
appropriate illustrations of the perishable and unsatis- 
factory character of the pursuits to which they had 
been devoted. Lady Bessborough's coffin, evidently 
of foreign make, is of enormous size, and in the niche 
above is that of the child, for whom she is said to 
have grieved even unto death. Close to the entrance 
is the body of Elizabeth, Duchess of Devonshire, 
subsequently spoken of; the coffin, like that of Lady 
Bessborough's, being of an oblong square and of Italian 
manufacture. There are at least forty coffins in this 
vault. My feelings were subdued when I left it, 


1 84 THE LIFE OF 

particularly so when I recalled to my mind Wraxall's 
description of Lady Bessborough's visit to her sister's 
tomb. 

In introducing the translation of Petrarch's sonnet, 
I had occasion to advert to Elizabeth, Duchess of 
Devonshire, the Duke's second wife, and to allude to 
the estimation in which she held her friend and pre- 
decessor's accomplishments. Before concluding this 
chapter, it may not be irrelevant to speak of her great 
taste and acquirements; indeed it is impossible to 
mention one of these celebrated women without think- 
ing of the other, for the intimacy that existed between 
them was perfectly Siamese — and after the separation 
of Lady Elizabeth from Mr. Foster, her first husband, 
had taken place, she became an inmate of Devonshire 
House, on the gossip of which I forbear to dwell. The 
two friends afterwards travelled together on the Con- 
tinent, and when at Lausanne, in 1787, an incident 
occurred which proves that she was scarcely less 
delightfully insinuating, or less talented, than her 
gifted companion. 

The anecdote, charming in itself, is admirably 
related in a contribution to the Gentleman's Magazine, 
and amusingly displays the consummate vanity of the 
philosophic Gibbon, who was a fixed resident in that 
town, and formed a welcome addition to their society. 
" Beautiful in her person," says this writer, " fascinat- 
ing in her manner, still under the age of thirty, and 
wholly unsuspicious of all amorous pretensions from a 
man of the mature years, ungainly figure, and love- 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 185 

repelling countenance of her learned countryman, she 
checked not the exuberance of her admiration of his 
genius : she had unconsciously, however, made a deep 
impression on his imagination, and one morning, more 
especially, just as he had terminated his elaborate 
performance, and felt elated with the achievement, as he 
so glowingly describes the sensation in his " Life," he 
invited the seductive lady to breakfast; when in a 
bower, fragrant with encircling acacias, he selected for 
her perusal various attractive passages of the conclud- 
ing sheets. 

" Enchanted with the masterly narrative, her lady- 
ship complimented him on the completion of his task 
with a charm of language, and warmth of address, 
which the author's prurient fancy, much too licentiously 
indulged, as his writings prove, converted into effusions 
of tenderer inspiration. Falling on his knees, he gave 
utterance to an impassioned profession of love, greatly 
to the surprise of its object, who, recoiling from his 
contact, entreated him to rise from this humiliating 
posture. Thus recalled to cooler feeling, but prostrate 
and helpless from his unwieldy form, he vainly sought 
to regain his feet, and the delicate female, whose first 
astonishment soon yielded to irrepressible laughter at 
the ridiculous scene, was equally powerless in affording 
relief; until at length, with the aid of two robust 
women, he was re-seated in his arm-chair, from which 
it was pretexted he had accidentally slipt. Thus 
' solventur risu tabulae,' a laugh at once dissolves the 
lover's enchantment, and with it evaporated the lady's 


1 86 THE LIFE OF 

anger, genuine or simulated; for with the Lady Eliza- 
beth, this demonstration of the Promethean puissance 
of her charms, which could quicken into vivid emotion 
such a mass of seemingly inert matter, was, on reflec- 
tion, felt rather as a homage than an offence; and 
though unfruitful of effect in evoking, as in the opera 
of Zemire and Azor, or, Beauty and the Beast, a re- 
sponsive flame, it in no sense interrupted her friendly 
intercourse with Gibbon." 

This " decline and fall " in the historian's philo- 
sophy, and total forgetfulness of the chances of ridi- 
cule, certainly gives an exalted idea of the Lady 
Elizabeth's charms; but my amiable friend, to whom 
she presented the translation of Petrarch's sonnet, and 
on whom, unlike Gibbon, time has exercised a soften- 
ing influence over the passions, writes even now thus 
eloquently in her praise : — " You are much too young 
to have known Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, 
and therefore felt la belle passion for her, as every 
man did in my day : 1 had the honour of knowing 
both her and her successor, and in spite of the fine 
eyes and seductive manners of the former, I preferred 
Elizabeth. I will not, however, draw any comparisons 
between them, unless, indeed, it should be between 
their literary accomplishments. Elizabeth did not, as 
far as I know, ever dabble in poetry : she did more 
than this; she was a zealous patroness of literature 
and the fine arts; she was the Duchess who, at her 
own expense, caused a machine to be fabricated for 
dragging the Tiber, in the vain hope of redeeming 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 187 

some of the statues which it is well ascertained had 
been thrown into it at different periods during the 
civil wars, and the first invasion of Clovis. That 
praiseworthy attempt, though often repeated, was 
utterly fruitless. 

" It was she also who caused, at her own expense, 
the ^Eneid to be translated into Italian verse, a 
magnificent work which, in point of elegance, fidelity, 
and typographical correctness, leaves nothing to be 
desired. With that in his hand, the traveller may 
trace the progress of ./Eneas from his first landing in 
Italy, to the fatal termination of his combat with 
Turnus. Her palace at Rome, as well as her purse, 
was open to all men of genius, without distinction of 
rank or country : she may be said to have held the 
keys of the Vatican and other libraries; for, owing 
to her influence, I obtained admission to them when 
they were closed even to the Romans themselves, 
in consequence either of repairs or festivals. Though 
others may, I have none but pleasing souvenirs 
of that charming woman, for I owed many obli- 
gations to her kindness during my residence at 
Rome. 

" One of the most gratifying memorials I possess is 
a letter that she wrote to me shortly after her schemes 
for dragging the Tiber for antiques had failed, in which 
she feelingly deplores the result : it is a curious proof 
of fine feeling and affectation, two qualities not very 
compatible with each other; I allude to her mode of 


1 88 THE LIFE OF 

writing merely the initial and final letters of words, 
an affectation which often cost me considerable trouble 
in guessing at her meaning. Thus, in referring to her 
repeated disappointments on this subject, he writes, 
— ' My 1 — t like my f — t at — s have failed ! ' Not- 
withstanding this, I have no hesitation in saying, that 
if a woman could be properly termed the Maecenas 
of her age, Elizabeth, Duchess of Devonshire, well 
deserved the appellation." She also published, at 
Rome, an edition of her friend and predecessor's 
poem, The Passage of the St. Gothard, and the fifth 
satire of the First Book of Horace, with illustrations, 
several of which were designed and executed by her- 
self. Her Grace's death, in March 1824, interrupted 
the completion of a Dante, which she had also 
intended to illustrate with one hundred plates. She 
was the friend of Cardinal Gonsalvi, of Canova, 
Cammucini, and Thorwaldsen, and was generally sur- 
rounded by eminent artists and men of letters; 
her influence in Rome was great, partly owing to her 
classical and literary taste, but still more to a munifi- 
cence which scarcely knew a limit, and it was this 
influence perhaps, which led the widow of the younger 
Pretender (and afterwards of Alfieri) thus to address 
the Duchess from her palazzo at Florence, ' Ma belle 
amie, on dit ici, que vous re"gnez a Rome, permettez 
moi d'aller vous visiter dans vos e"tats,' &c., &c. In 
the spirit of old Rome a medal of her was struck at 
her death, commemorative of her arduous exertions in

the protection and advancement of Italian literature, 
and her unwearied efforts to preserve or restore to 
the world any remains of the classical antiquities 
which she so deeply venerated. Her Grace was 
a daughter of the fourth Earl of Bristol."

AT the Duke of Devonshire's, Brummell had many 
and agreeable opportunities of improving his acquaint- 
ance with the wits, and celebrated men, of the party 
of which his Grace was the leader, and his Duchess 
such an enthusiastic supporter. But Brummell, though 
a staunch Whig, took little active interest in their 
political proceedings, and in all probability, his reason 
for preferring their society was, that their leisure 
hours were more convivially spent than those of the 
ministerial one, and the " Pilot who weathered the 
storm." 

Foremost amongst these wits was General Fitz- 
patrick, and I shall in this chapter introduce two of 
his contributions to the Beau's album, as well as those 
of several more of Brummell's friends, whose verses 
have likewise escaped the printing press. Richard

BEAU BRUMMELL. 191 

Fitzpatrick, the son of John, first Earl of Upper 
Ossory, was born January 3<Dth, 1747. In his youth 
he served in the American War, but, having a political 
turn, he relinquished active service, and entered the 
senate as member for Tavistock, in 1780. Though he 
attained the post of Secretary of War, he was far 
more celebrated as the friend of Fox, and his com- 
panion at the gaming-table, and as one of the best 
political versifiers of his day, than as a statesman, or 
an orator. The General was the author of some of 
the happiest pleasantries in the Rolliad, and the Pro- 
bationary Odes; he wrote the verses on Brooke 
Watson, those on the Marquis of Graham, and the 
Liars; he also wrote Dorinda, a town eclogue, and 
other short pieces. The following specimen of his 
politico-poetical talents is nearly, if not quite, equal to 
any squib Swift ever wrote.

Which, how closely e'er you lock it, 

In due time will reach your pocket. 

So sham cripples, whom we meet 

Asking alms through many a street, 

Rob by night (their wooden leg off) 

Those they in the morning beg of, 

And, as laws are made restraining 

Suffering wretches from complaining,

Lift their crutch and lay them sprawling.

So absurd and void of reason, 
To increase the ass's loads 
He has plung'd in miry roads? 
v British dolts, if 'tis your pleasure 
To endure such loads as these are, 
Prate no more about your freedom — 
Empty boasts ! for none will heed 'em. 
All your spirit is but vapour, 
Magna Charta mere waste-paper; 
All your boasted fire but smoke, — 
Beasts of burden, bear the yoke ! " 

Near these lines of the General's were the following 
anonymous verses, also humorously referring to the 
excessive taxation of the times. The name of Miller, 
in the first stanza, made me fear they might have 
been printed in a collection of poetry written for a 
fantastical lady of that name, who lived at a villa near 
Bath, and published in 1775 for charitable purposes, 
under the title of The Vase of Bath-Easton; but on 
consulting the work I did not find them, and this leads 
me to hope that they have never been printed. At 
this villa the lady used to receive a large and distin- 
guished circle of friends every Thursday, and the 
chief amusement of these reunions was to read aloud 
the scraps of sentimental and other poetry that had 

been composed by them, perhaps in the King's bath, 
VOL. i. N 


194 THE LIFE OF 

in the previous week, much of which was in praise 
of herself, her villa, and each other. Horace Walpole, 
in describing the Bath-Easton vagaries, writes thus to 
General Conway : 

"Mrs. Miller is returned a beauty, a genius, a 
Sappho, a tenth muse, as romantic as Mademoiselle 
de ScudeYi, and as unsophisticated as Mrs. Vesey. 
The captain's ringers are loaded with cameos, his 
tongue runs over with virtu; and that both may con- 
tribute to the improvement of their own country, they 
have introduced bouts rime's as a new discovery. They 
hold a Parnassus fair every Thursday, give out 
rhymes and themes, and all the flux of quality at 
Bath contend for the prizes. A Roman vase, dressed 
with pink ribbons and myrtles, receives the poetry, 
which is drawn out every festival. Six judges of 
these Olympic games retire and select the brightest 
compositions, which the respective successful acknow- 
ledge, kneel to Mrs. Calliope Miller, kiss her fair hand, 
and are crowned by it with myrtle, with — I do not 
know what. You may think this is a fiction or 
exaggeration. Be dumb, unbelievers. The collection 
is printed, published. Yes, by my faith, there are 
bouts rime's on a buttered muffin, made by her Grace 
the Duchess of Northumberland; recipes to make 
them by Corydon the venerable, alias George Pitt; 
others very pretty by Lord Palmerston; some by 
Lord Carlisle; many by Mrs. Miller herself, that have 
no fault but wanting metre, and immortality promised 
to her without end or measure. In short, since folly, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 195 

which never ripens to madness but in this hot climate, 
ran distracted, there never was anything so entertain- 
ing or so dull.1' 

" CASTLES IN THE AIR." 

" Were I content on earth to dwell, 

To earth my views confine; 
With rapture, Miller, I'd survey 
This paradise of thine. 

I too my willing voice would raise, 

And equal praise bestow, 
But that the scene which others praise, 

For me is far too low. 

I grant the hills are crown'd with trees 

I grant the fields are fair; 
Yet after all one nothing sees, 

But what is really there. 

True taste ideal fancy feigns 

Whilst on poetic wings; 
'Bove earth, and all that earth contains, 

Unbounded fancy springs. 

To dwell on earth's gross element, 

Let grovelling spirits bear, 
Whilst I on nobler plans intent 

Build castles in the air. 

No neighbours there can disagree, 

Or thwart what I design; 
For there not only all I see, 

But all I wish, is mine. 

No surly landlord's leave I want, 

To make or pull down fence; 
I build, I furnish, lay out, plant, 

Regardless of expense. 


196 THE LIFE OF 

One thing, indeed, excites my fear, 

Nor let it seem surprising, 
Since Ministers, from year to year, 

New taxes are devising, 

Lest earth being taxed, as soon it may, 

Beyond what earth can bear, 
Our Financier a tax should lay 

On castles in the air ! 

Well with the end the means would suit, 

Did he in these our days, 
Ideal plans to execute, 

Ideal taxes raise." 

Multifarious, indeed, were the schemes sent in to 
Government, towards the close of the last century, 
with a view of raising new taxes. It must have been 
at this time that the Austrian General exclaimed one 
day, in the Hay market, " Good Heavens ! you rule 
the seas, and you give a guinea-and-a-half for a cod- 
fish : " a bitter epigram; for the Imperialist thought 
that a guinea was laid on by the Government as a 
tax! 

It is impossible, with every proper feeling of vene- 
ration for Horace Walpole's taste, to coincide with 
him in his admiration of Lord Palmerston's poetry, in 
the Vase of Bath-Easton. Tickell is more correct, 
when he says, " With chirps of wit, and mutilated 
lays, see Palmerston fineer his bouts rime's." There 
are also, in the Gentleman's Magazine, several speci- 
mens of his Lordship's poetry, which are not very 
felicitous; but the following epitaph on his first wife, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 197 

Miss Poole, which was also in Brummell's collec- 
tion, might well have softened Tickell's satire. It is 
not exaggerated praise to say, that these lines will bear 
comparison with those of Mason; and the composition 
was probably influenced by his Lordship's having read 
and admired them; for the Poet's wife died in her 
twenty-eighth year, at Bristol Hot- Wells, March 27th, 
1767, two years before Lady Palmerston, who also 
expired at the same place. 

"Whoe'er, like me, with trembling anguish brings 
His heart's whole treasure to fair Bristol's springs; 
Whoe'er, like me, to soothe distress and pain, 
Shall court these salutary springs in vain : 
Condemn'd, like me, to hear the faint reply, 
To mark the fading cheek, the sinking eye; 
From the chill brow to wipe the damps of death, 
And watch, in dumb despair, the shortening breath; — 
If chance should bring him to this artless line, 
Let the sad mourner know his pangs were mine : 
Ordain'd to lose the partner of my breast, 
Whose beauty warm'd me, and whose virtues bless'd, 
Framed, every tie that binds the heart to prove, 
Her duty, friendship, and her friendship, love; — 
But yet remembering that the parting sigh 
Appoints the just to slumber — not to die — 
The starting tear I check'd,— I kiss'd the rod — 
And, not to earth resign'd her, but to God ! " 

But these poems have interrupted the conclusion of 
this short notice of General Fitzpatrick. He had a 
very commanding presence and courtly manners, and 
possessed an inexhaustible fund of conversation as 
well as wit, which qualities, combined with great good- 


198 THE LIFE OF 

nature, rendered him an universal favourite; but, like 
his friend Fox, and the rest of that party, Fitzpatrick 
appears to have been sadly deficient in the principle 
of moderation, the power of regulating his passions 
and habits, and the steadiness of character and in- 
dustry which tended so much to the success of their 
opponents, and to command for them the respect 
in which they were held, even by those who differed 
from their political views. Long indulgence in the 
pleasures of the table impaired, in later life, his bodily 
as well as mental faculties, and Wraxall gives a pain- 
ful account of the shattered state of both, shortly 
before his death. This took place on the 25th April 
1813, in the sixty-seventh year of his age. 

Lord Upper Ossory, General Fitzpatrick's elder 
brother, though not so witty or so popular, was a 
man of much more temperate habits, and highly and 
deservedly esteemed. Horace Walpole, in writing 
from Paris to George Selwyn, in 1765, mentions him 
in favourable terms : — " We have swarms of English; 
but most of them know not Joseph, and Joseph desires 
not to know them. I live with none of them but 
Crawford and Lord Ossory; the latter of whom I am 
extremely sorry is returning to England; I recom- 
mend him to Mr. Williams as one of the properest 
and most amiable young men I ever knew." At this 
time Lord Ossory was only twenty years of age, and 
Walpole seems to have valued his acquaintance, as 
he was for many years after a frequent visitor at 
Ampthill. 


BE A U BR UMMELL. 1 99 

His Lordship, who was educated at Eton and 
Oxford, had a poetical turn as well as his brother; 
and, to judge by the lines addressed to Lady Tyr- 
connel, now given, this talent was usefully and kindly 
employed : the warning, however, that his poetry con- 
veyed on this occasion was unheeded; or, if it caused 
a temporary check in her thoughtless career, she did 
not eventually profit by it. This lady, who was a 
daughter of the famous Marquis of Granby, married 
George, second Earl of Tyrconnel, and was divorced 
from him in 1777, being then in her twenty- fourth 
year : she subsequently married the Honourable 
Philip Anstruther, according to the Peerage; but the 
Gentleman's Magazine, in mentioning her death in 
1792, says P. Leslie, Esq., once a wine-merchant in 
France, and second son of Lord Newark of Scot- 
land. 

This discrepancy in this gentleman's identity arose 
from the 'following circumstances : David Leslie, 
second Lord Newark, a staunch friend of Charles the 
First, died in 1694, leaving an only daughter, who 
married Sir A. Anstruther, Bart. : his son claimed the 
barony of Newark, after his mother's death, when the 
House of Lords gave a decision in his favour; but 
they afterwards retracted their verdict. Philip An- 
struther, Esq., would therefore have been his proper 
denomination, in 1792, though the metre of the lines 
seems to indicate Leslie, as the name used by Lord 
Ossory. 


200 THE LIFE OF 

ADDRESSED TO LADY TYRCONNEL. 

LORD UPPER OSSORY. 

" Envy, that loves not merit, ne'er will spare 
A form so perfect, and a face so fair; 
Let prudence, then, o'er all your steps preside, 
And sage discretion every action guide. 
For know (but first I must demand excuse 
For the plain bluntness of an honest muse), 
Know and reflect, ere yet it is too late, 
You stand this moment on the brink of fate. 
By fashion blinded, and by folly led, 
The path of ruin and of vice you tread; 
Reflect — long years of sorrow must repay 
The short-lived pleasures of one fleeting day; 
Lovely and young, and in Tyrconnel blest, 
By strangers honour'd and by friends caress'd, 
How will they mourn to hear cursed envy tell 
From what a glorious height of bliss you fell ! 
What charms can you in empty Leslie find, 
To shake your virtue, or your judgment blind? 
Shun him — not only him, but all the rest 
That would plant daggers in thy youthful breast; 
Guard from their arts thy yet unspotted fame, 
And spare thy honour'd father's glorious name." 

This is a singular subject for Lord Ossory to have 
touched upon; as, about seven years before these 
lines were written, he had married the wife of Augus- 
tus Henry, third Duke of Grafton, who had been 
previously divorced from that notorious libertine. 
The Duke's profligate amours, and more especially 
his liaison with Nancy Parsons, a once beautiful, but 
then superannuated courtesan, led to his estrangement 
from his accomplished and injured Duchess; and it 


Du/ce of Graftoji. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 201 

must have been a deep interest in her misfortunes 
that tempted Lord Ossory into forming an intimacy 
which led to a dissolution of this ill-assorted marriage. 
Many and great were the trials this amiable woman 
endured, before she consented to take the step which 
tarnished her reputation, and deprived her of the 
place in society that her virtues adorned. Gilly 
Williams, intending to throw ridicule on her religious 
feelings, writes thus in 1765 : "The Duchess of 
Grafton goes nowhere but to church." Horace Wai- 
pole, who was, says Mr. Jesse,1 an ardent admirer 
of her beauty, her good sense, and many endearing 
qualities, and who, more than once, speaks of her 
enthusiastically as " my Duchess," pays her a pleas- 
ing compliment, in his poem of " The Three Herons." 
Lady Ossory was the only daughter of the first Lord 
Ravensworth, and died in February 1804.

CHAPTER XV. 

Lord John Townshend— Lady Hunlohe — Sir Robert Adair—Poem of 
Georgian^ Duchess of Devonshire's, supposed to be addressed to Sir 
Robert Adair, by Lady Hvnloke — Sir Robert Adair's Reply to Lady 
Hunloke, by Lord John Townshend — Sir Gregory Page Turnei — 
Sir G. Osborne Turner— Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt Jones— Mr. 
Robson, M.P. 

AMONGST the names of valued friends mentioned by 
Brummell, in his letter to the lady to whom he pre- 
sented his album, is that of Lord John Townshend, 
son of the first Marquis Townshend so much distin- 
guished at the battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy, and 
who had the melancholy satisfaction of receiving the 
keys of Quebec after the death of Wolfe. Lord John 
was born on the iQth of January 1757, and was a 
godson of George the Second. He was educated at 
Eton, and afterwards went to Cambridge, where his 
career was so brilliant that the University returned 
him as their member at the age of twenty-three. He 
had been a candidate the previous year, 1779, when 
he was defeated by the Solicitor-General Mansfield, 
but only by twelve votes. It was on this occasion 
that the Marquis sent a man up to vote against his 
son, and for Lord Hyde, the third candidate. Lord 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 203 

John's adherence to the Whig party cost him his seat 
in 1784, when he was superseded by Mr. Pitt. He 
was subsequently returned, with Fox as his colleague, 
for Westminster, and afterwards sat twenty-five years 
for Knaresborough, at the expiration of which time 
he retired from Parliament. 

" Few men," says Wraxall, " held a higher place 
in Fox's friendship than the Lord John Townshend; 
a place to which he was entitled by the elegance of 
his mind, his various accomplishments, and his adher- 
ence to him through life. If party could ever feel 
regret, it would have been excited by his being ex- 
cluded from a seat so honourable in itself as that of 
the University of Cambridge, to which he had attained 
by unwearied personal exertions." In early life Lord 
John was conspicuous in society for the grace of his 
manners, and, as his friend Tickell says, " for his 
pathetic bow." His poetical productions were admired 
for their exquisite humour; and, in conjunction with 
Tickell, he wrote the satire entitled Jekyll. To him 
we also owe the Probationary Ode for Major Scott, 
and the playful parody of " Donee gratus eram tibi; " 
he likewise wrote a severe ode addressed to Lord 
North, and similarly pungent verses to Lords Barring- 
ton, Dartmouth, and George Germaine. 

A party at Chatsworth, at which Lord John was 
present, gave rise to the following pretty piece of 
scandal in verse by the Duchess of Devonshire. It 
has been already alluded to, and will introduce a reply 
by his lordship, who, as I have before observed, was 


204 THE LIFE OF 

one of her intimate friends. In this poem the spirit- 
uelle Georgiana appears to have been amusing herself 
not a little at the expense of Lady Hunloke, wife of 
Sir Henry Hunloke, Bart., and a sister of the late 
Lord Leicester. Her ladyship was one of the 
duchess's country neighbours, and stands accused of 
having a predilection for Mr., afterwards the Right 
Honourable Sir Robert Adair, also one of her Grace's 
political friends, and a visitor at Chatsworth. 

This gentleman, son of the celebrated surgeon of 
that name by Lady Caroline Keppel, daughter of 
William, second Earl of Albemarle, was the eleve and 
friend of Fox, whose memory he defended against 
Tomline; and while he sat in parliament, which he 
did, first for Appleby, and afterwards for Camelford, 
he steadily supported that statesman. In 1789, when 
Russia was menaced by England for her policy with 
regard to Turkey, Mr. Adair, under Fox's auspices, 
visited St. Petersburgh (a fact which the reader must 
bear in mind as he peruses the poem), to counteract 
Mr. Pitt's measures; and it was after this that the 
Empress Catherine requested Fox to sit for his bust, 
which she subsequently placed between those of 
Demosthenes and Cicero. That Charles Fox should 
feel an honest satisfaction in preserving his country 
from being embroiled in an unnecessary war, is per- 
fectly comprehensible; but it is difficult to believe 
that he attached any value to this hollow compliment 
from the great representative of absolute power. In 
1806, Mr. Adair was appointed ambassador at Vienna, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 205 

and three years after was sent as minister to 
Constantinople; after which, he retired from public 
life. 

The " dingy home," of which the duchess speaks 
in the opening lines of this poem, is Wingerworth 
Hall, the seat of the Hunloke family; and it was 
probably the iron founderies in the neighbourhood of 
Chesterfield that suggested the allusion, for Winger- 
worth is but two or three miles from that town; 
the Hall is about ten from Chatsworth. Though the 
Duchess of Devonshire's love of literature was quite 
sufficient to excite the envious of her day to call her 
a Blue, she would, by the quiz she thus inflicted upon 
her contemporary, have completely escaped the more 
recent denunciation of that clique by Trebeck, who 
observes, " that the Blues seldom condescend to 
scandal except scandal of the worst kind, such as rip- 
ping up old grievances, and speaking shamefully ill of 
the dead. I met a Blue the other day who was dis- 
cussing the Suffolk letters, and Walpole's memoirs, 
and then went on to say paw-paw things of Lady 
Mary Wortley Montague. Now really this is quite 
atrocious : to attack a modern reputation is venial in 
comparison. Thank Heaven, with all my faults, it 
cannot be said that I ever slandered anybody's great- 
great-grandmother." Now I venture to hope the 
reader will not think that I have slandered a great- 
grandmother (for such would Lady Hunloke be were 
she now alive) by publishing these lines, as at the 
period they were written she was in her fifty-first 


206 THE LIFE OF 

year. Lady Hunloke is said to have been a merry, 
talkative, and coquettish lady, and, like her friend the 
duchess, very fond of play.

" Undone and plunder^, waddling, sad, and slow, 
From Chatsworth to my dingy home I go; 
The barren heaths and mines of coal I view, 
And turn my back, but not my thoughts from you; 
The dreary landscape renovates my care, 
Since gloom and cinders but recall Adair. 
What though on all my smiles incessant shone, 
Except when Bessborough l the rubber won; 
Though softest meanings on my accents spoke, 
Save when I cursed Lord Granville Gower's * revoke? 
And though soft looks express'd my feelings bland 
Except when squinting into Denman's* hand; 
Yet though on all with varying grace I rose 
Repeating scraps of poetry and prose; 
My ample learning though I deign'd to show 
And quoted French and Latin Apropos — 
Yet still on thee my anxious thoughts were bent, 
For thee, the smile, the nod, the wink, were meant. 
And though, at first, I little understood 
The flattering import of thy pensive mood, 
Thy frowning brow, pale cheek, and downcast eye, 
And absent wandering of each set reply;

Yet soon I triumph'd in the inflicted smart, 

And prized my conquest o'er a statesman's heart, 

And, as bright rays, to one fixed focus brought, 

Concent'ring there to blazing flames are wrought, 

My charms with shafts of fire inflamed thy pond'rous thought. 

'Twas rash in me the dangerous sight to view, 

Though fat, and red, I caught the infection too : 

And, though much courted by the lordling band, 

Though e'en Lord Ossulston l on tiptoe stand; 

In spite of all the attentive Morpeth2 spoke, 

All Bennet's pedantry, and Townshend's 3 joke, 

All Granville's beauty, and Duncannon's * youth, 

To thee I vow my constancy and truth. 

No longer, then, be politics thy care, — 

For can a motion with my heart compare? — 

No longer strike the Treasury bench with dread, 

Nor like Lord Burleigh shake thy meaning head. 

E'en Fox will yield the lightning of thy eye, 

Thy frown terrific, and thy mute reply; 

For generous Fox can never disapprove, 

That public toils should cede to happy love ! 

Let Buonaparte sway the jarring world, 

Be realms, be empires, from their bases hurl'd, 

No counter revolutions me shall wait, 

No restoration of a monarch's fate; 

For soon as poor Sir Harry breathes no more 

I'll fly to meet the lover I adore ! 

Bucks and Archbishops I'll alike discard, 

And thou of all mankind alone regard. 

Then take no mission to the Baltic's tide, 

To freeze thy soul and pinch thy scanty side; 

To warmer comforts let thy fancy turn, 

Nor longer from thee joys connubial spurn.

Tell them their reign is o'er, their maxims stale, 

And that thy choice is, pudding, beef, and ale;

Then doubt no more, but hear thy Hunloke swear, 

With thee, her life, her love, — her jointure too, she'll share. " 

As Mr. Adair was a poet, for he is said to have 
contributed to the Rolliad and Probationary Odes, it 
may be supposed, that he was ignorant of the joke 
that the party at Chatsworth were carrying on against 
him and the comely half-century from Wingerworth, 
or he would have seized his own lyre and sung his 
own strain — calm or impassioned. But fortunately 
for my readers this was not the case, or they would 
have lost the following droll and desperate reply that 
Lord John obligingly concocted for him, and while 
composing which, it is clear he ludicrously kept in 
view Pope's poem of Eloisa to Abelard. By the 
allusion to the Congress at Luneville, these vers-de- 
soctitt were evidently written late in the winter of 
1800, or very early in the succeeding year, as the 
treaty of peace was not signed until the Qth of Feb- 
ruary 1801. The "starving land," in the second line, 
was no exaggerated expression respecting the state 
of the country, for about this period the quartern loaf 
was sold for half-a-crown. 

ROBERT ADAIR'S REPLY TO LADY HUNLOKE. 

LORD JOHN TOWNSHEND. 

" In times like these, when to St. Stephen's walls 
A starving land the legislature calls ! 


Revd James Hackman. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 209 

Now when the patriot band should be prepared, 
Nor pamphlets now, nor paragraphs be spared; 
Why rove I here when Parliament is met? 
Why stray my steps beyond thy shop, Debrett? ' 
What means this stupor in a statesman's breast? 
Fame, virtue, sleeps, — ambition is at rest, — 
My long-made maiden speech remember'd not; 
The House of Commons, the Whig-club forgot ! 
Far other cares thy lover Hunloke, knows ! 
All Hackman's 2 sorrows, and all Werther's woes ! 
Lost and extinct, my party zeal I see, 
And pity fools that think of aught but thee. 
What though, unmatch'd in diplomatic fame, 
Beyond the Baltic they revere my name? 
Though now at Luneville the Congress wait 
Adair's decision upon Europe's fate; 

1 Debrett's shop opposite Burlington House, was, until lately, occu- 
pied by Mr. Pickering the publisher. Mr. Stockdale, who has been 
succeeded by Mr. Thorpe, bookseller and autograph collector, lived 
next door. Perhaps Lady Hunloke's house was nearer to the Park, 
for a former family mansion of Sir Harry's was in Piccadilly; this 
house was purchased by Lord Coventry, in 1765, for ten thousand 
pounds. 

2 The Rev. James Hackman had first been an officer, and became 
afterwards a clergyman; he shot Miss Reay, the mistress of Lord 
Sandwich, as she was coming out of Covent Garden Theatre. Lust 
and jealousy hurried him to the commission of this deed on the 7th. of 
April 1779, and he was hung on the igth of the same month at 
Tyburn. The hangman's cupidity on the occasion was of the most 
barefaced description; when the unfortunate culprit flung down his 
handkerchief as the signal for the cart to move on, instead of instantly 
whipping the horses he jumped on the other side of him to snatch it 
up, lest he should lose this perquisite in the crowd; he then returned 
to the cart, and, as Lord Carlisle writes to George Selwyn, "with the 
gesture so faithfully represented by your friend Lord Wentworth, 
Jehu'd him out of the world." There still exists in. a private garden 
at Hampton Court, a grotto that was constructed by Miss Reay — and 
with her own hands. She left Lord Sandwich five children, one of 
whom, Mr. Basil Montagu, became a lawyer of eminence, and died in 
1851, in his 8zd year.

2io THE LIFE OF 

Should at my feet the mighty Consul fall, 

France, Austria, Russia, I would scorn them all.1 

Not Fox's mission would I deign to carry, 

Here let me stay, the rival of Sir Harry ! 

Thou know'st how first at Chatsworth I was made 

Thy hapless victim, as at whist we play'd; 

Each wink, each shrug, each whisper, and each look, 

For softest hints my vanity mistook; , 

Too soon I found, how rash was my conceit, 

All eyes but mine thou couldst contrive to cheat. 

Say not for me were meant thy sly regards, 

Not me they ogled, but Lord Bessborough's cards; 

Too plain I saw (no wonder in the dumps) 

Thy side-long glances leering at his trumps; 

Thou say'st that when Sir Harry leaves thee free, 

Thy heart, thy card-purse, shall belong to me; 

Nor beef, nor ale, nor pudding wilt thou grudge, — 

All this thou say'st — but all thou say'st is fudge. 

Soon as Sir Harry's fatal knell shall toll, 

Oh ! that 'twere mine his widow to console ! 2 

But ah ! some youth more delicate than I, 

Shall hush thy murmurs, and thy tears shall dry. 

Some sturdier swain more suited to thy taste, 

With keener stomach for the rich repast. 

Then fly me, fly — to Wingerworth repair, 

Forget, renounce, abjure, the lost Adair ! 

Yet say, my Hunloke, thou who every part 

Of Shakspeare's drama canst repeat by heart, 


1 " Should at my feet the world's great master fall, 
Himself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn them all 
Not Caesar's empress would I deign to prove, 
No— make me mistress to the man I love." 

POPE. — Eloisa to Abelard. 

* How much unnecessary trouble the Duchess and Lord John gave 
themselves about the Rt. Hon. diplomatist's love affairs was shown by 
his marrying, in 1805, Gabrielle Angelica, Countess d'Hagincourt, at 
which time Lady Hunloke was "a widow," Sir Henry having died 
on the 1 5th of November 1804. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 211 

Where's the mock envy, or fictitious spleen, 

But some similitude in me is seen? 

Long nursed and train'd in Melancholy's school, 

One sad epitome of every fool. 

Oft hast thou heard me sigh, and seen me look, 

Like musing Jacques stretch'd by a murmuring brook; 

Seen me its stream augment with many a tear, 

And moujn and moralise the passing deer : 

Vain of my yellow hue, oft seen me move, 

The piteous pageant of Malvolio's love. 

Oft, too, like Romeo's, is my woful plight, 

Banish'd from thine, as he from Juliet's sight; 

Prostrate the holy priest beheld him fall, 

And heard the frantic wretch for poison call; 

From thee exiled, not less I madly rave, 

Or ' take the measure of an unmade grave; ' 

Not less resolved to play some desperate freak, 

And stare, and terrify poor Parson Peeke ! 

Yet oh, vain cares, not all the fire I've felt, 

' That solid, ah ! too solid flesh can melt ' — 

Vain is my vacant stare, my random talk, 

Vain the slow grandeur of my pensive walk; 

Vain is my faded form's pathetic grace, 

My hopeless, endless, comfortless disgrace ! 

My sallow cheek — my sad funereal air, 

And deep and hollow groans, that paint the soul's despair. 

Then rouse, Adair ! assume a nobler part ! 

Let fame, let glory, re-inspire thy heart ! 

Lo ! where St. Stephen's chapel greets thine eyes, 

Its proudest triumphs are thine easy prize; 

There anxious ever, ever on the watch, 

Each trick of singularity to catch, 

To pause and bow, and every gesture ape 

That art assumes in senatorial shape; 

Lend me, ye mimic powers ! your aid divine, 

Each grace concentrate, and each charm combine. 

Teach me, like Grey,1 to rise, or to sit down; 

To stare like Sheridan, like Tierney frown; 

1 The first Earl, then Mr. Grey. 


THE LIFE OF 

To stoop like Wyndham, or erect, like Pitt, 

Proudly take out my handkerchief, and spit; 

Or rap with all Dundas's force the box, 

And shriek and scream, and almost sweat like Fox. 

I fly, I fly, impetuous to town, 

Pride of the Whigs, and terror of the Crown; 

Rush to the House, and furious to impeach, 

Discharge at Pitt my long-projected speech. 

Then, not on thee, not on my Hunloke's face, 

My ardent gaze is fix'd— but on the mace; l 

These eyes, that wont to languish in despair, 

Then flash their fire around the Speaker's chair. 

And now, both sides attentive homage pay, 

Sir Gregory Page 2 and Tyrwhitt Jones 3 give way; 


Not on the cross my eyes were fix'd, but you; 
Not grace, or zeal, love only was my call, 
And if I lose thy love I lose my all."

1 Sir Gregory Page Turner, third baronet, succeeded his great uncle, 
Sir G. Page, in August 1795,' when he added to his own the name 
and arms of Page. Sir Gregory was a Tory, and at the general election 
in 1784 was chosen member for Thirsk, in Yorkshire, which he repre- 
sented up to the time of his death. He did not, however, add much 
to the brilliancy of the debates, and when Mr. Grey, in 1797, moved 
for a reform in the representation of the people, a motion that was 
seconded by Erskine, and supported by Fox, Sheridan, and others, Sir 
G. Page Turner gave it his most strenuous opposition, pathetically 
asserting, " that he always felt for the Constitution, and nothing else, 
when he got up in the morning, and when he lay down at night." 
His death is said to have been caused by his chagrin at not succeeding 
in a trial that he had with a builder, who made an iron bridge over a 
stream in his garden, the erection of which had been suggested to Lady 
Turner by a friend, and which cost nine hundred pounds. On examin- 
ing his secretaire, his executors found in it sixteen thousand seven 
hundred guineas. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Gregory 
Osborne, who had as litigious a disposition as his father, and was 
defeated in two celebrated trials; one with a Mr. Stroehling, who had 
painted a picture for him of Daniel in the lions' den, for the sum of 
fifteen hundred pounds; the other, with the Rev. Mr. Beazley, also on 
the subject of pictures. Sir G. Page Turner died on the 4th January 
1805, at his house in Portland Place.

Full in their view my doubled fist I clench. 

Loud and more loud the opposition cheer, 

Sturt x in the van, and Robson 2 in the rear; 

Pitt shrinks, turns pale, and trembles, as I shed 

My long-stored vengeance o'er his guilty head. 

Then he whose voice now melts in strains of love, 

Shall call for papers, for committees move; 

Bill after bill bring in, fresh motions make, 

Secure, at least, to keep himself awake; 

Or, should a tasteless audience cough and groan, 

Proud to prolong their sufferings not his own; 

Heavens ! in what seas of patriot flame I'm toss'd — 

How soon the lover's in the statesman lost ! 

Vain hopes, deceits — his heart's illusion o'er, 

And thou and Wingerworth ne'er thought of more.3 "

for nineteen shillings and sevenpence, which had been refused payment.

2I4 THE LIFE OF 


CHAPTER XVI. 

Charles Sturt, M.P.for Bridport—His Gallantry in Rescuing some Ship- 
wrecked Seamen — His Perilous Adventure and Great Presence of 
Mind— Mr. Sturt in the House of Commons — The young Ensign 
and the Town- Clerk— The Reverend Fell Akehurst—An Imaginary

No man better deserves a passing biographical notice 
than the late Charles Sturt, formerly M.P. for Brid- 
port, for he was one of the most open-hearted, gene- 
rous, and charitable men of his day, and many were 
the striking incidents in his life. His large fortune 
enabled him to indulge such a disposition without 
restraint; and in the town he represented he was 
idolised by all classes, — more especially, however, by 
the blue-jackets, who would have made Bridport a 
most uncomfortable abiding-place to any one who said 
anything against him. These men looked upon him 
as one of themselves, for he was devotedly fond of 
yachting, which, from his island-castle of Brownsea, 
he had every opportunity of enjoying; but the adora- 
tion in which he was held by the sailors of the town 
and coast rested not only on his love of that pursuit,. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 215 

but the great personal courage he displayed in his 
impetuous desire to do good; — he was, indeed, always 
" in the van," and frequently at the risk of his own 
life. 

On the 1st of February 1799, the Bee, bound for 
the West Indies, went on shore on the sands at Poole, 
the wind being at east, and blowing a tremendous 
gale, with heavy snow. The boats of the Tickler, 
gun-brig, went off to her assistance; they failed, how- 
ever, in their attempts to reach her, and she was left 
to her fate; but, in the course of the day, the crew 
were rescued by Charles Sturt, after having been, 
with his men, twice thrown from his boat into the 
breakers. 

Eighteen months after this exploit, being out in 
his cutter about two leagues from shore, and sail- 
ing against Mr. Weld's yacht, off Lulworth Castle, 
he observed that his own boat towing astern re- 
tarded her progress, and ordered a boy to take her 
ashore. The sea running very high, the lad declined, 
as did also the men; when Mr. Sturt, feeling it then 
a point of honour, immediately jumped into her : at 
this instant the rope gave way, and, by the force of 
the wind and receding tide, he was drifted to sea; 
soon after which the boat upset. In this perilous 
situation his presence of mind did not forsake him : 
he regained, by swimming, his station on the keel, 
and pulled off all his clothes except his trousers. It 
was after one of the many desperate struggles that he 
made of the same kind, that, giving up all for lost, he 


2i6 THE LIFE OF 

wrote with a pencil on a slip of paper, which he put 
in his watch-case, the following words, " Charles Sturt, 
Brownsea, to his beloved wife," and fastened the 
watch to his trousers. 

Shortly after, and almost by a miracle, a mate of 
a transport, three miles to windward, the last of 
several that had passed, happened to observe him, 
and four resolute fellows immediately embarked in a 
boat to his assistance; but as there was a heavy sea 
running, and they could only see him occasionally, it 
was not till after a hard pull of nearly two hours that 
they reached him. Poor Sturt was all but exhausted, 
and on the eve of relinquishing his failing hold upon 
the boat, when his preservers took him into theirs : 
unable to articulate his thanks, he lifted his hands 
to Heaven, and instantaneously burst into a flood of 
tears. Mr. Sturt was one of those who, after the 
short peace of Amiens, and in violation of the acknow- 
ledged laws of nations, were detained prisoners in 
France, from which country he escaped by his own 
energy and enterprise. 

In politics he was a Whig, and he seconded some 
of the late lamented Sir Francis Burdett's early 
motions in the House of Commons : in debate he 
was most vehement, and not very discreet. When 
Mr. Whitbread moved for a committee to inquire into 
the conduct of ministers respecting the French inva- 
sion of Ireland, his abuse of the Treasurer of the 
Navy was most copious. " The whole statement of 
the security of Ireland made by the honourable gentle- 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 217 

man (Mr. Dundas)," said Mr. Sturt, "is a mis-state- 
ment; he hoped in God he would not have much 
longer the direction of naval or any other affairs. 
He might wriggle, and grin " (Mr. Dundas shewing 
symptoms of uneasiness), " and twist, and toss his head 
about, as much as he pleased, but he hoped it would 
soon be twisted somewhere else." 

The Sturts were not only a gallant but a merry 
race, and a most laughable anecdote is told of a rela- 
tion of the member's, I believe a brother, who was in 
the army. This young gentleman, when an ensign 

in the Regiment, was quartered at Colchester, 

the town-clerk of which place, a Mr. S , was a 

particularly thrifty attorney, who, in the pride of his 
heart, had given out, not by the bellman, but next to 
it, that he could, would, and should give the two 

Misses S the sum of twenty thousand pounds 

each on their wedding-day. This want of caution, 
into which his vanity had betrayed him, made it 
necessary, as he fancied, to exclude the officers of the 
garrison from all participation in his hospitalities; 
and his extreme discretion naturally became the sub- 
ject of many a joke and discussion amongst them. 

In one of these mess-room gossips young Sturt, to 
the amazement of his companions, offered a bet that 
he would dine with the unapproachable treasures at 
their papa's own table, at a dinner-party for which 
they all knew that invitations had just been sent out. 
Of course the bet was quickly taken, and, on the day 
in question, young Sturt walked up to the attorney's 


218 THE LIFE OF 

door precisely at the dinner hour, and begged that he 
might see Mr. S on most urgent business. He 

was immediately admitted, for that gentleman had no 
idea of losing a client, though in a red coat; but he 
was not a little astonished when the officer gravely 
informed him that he was the bearer of intelligence 
that would save him ten thousand pounds. At this 
juncture, however, the dinner was announced, and 
Sturt, with well-feigned regret, was on the point of 
retiring, saying that he would call the next morning, 
when the bewildered lawyer, fearful of neglecting his 
guests, perhaps old clients, and yet distressed at the 
idea of losing his particulars, became totally forgetful 
of the dangerous chance to which he exposed the 

Misses S , and pressed him to join the party. 

This, after proper hesitation, the ensign consented to 
do, and taking good care to place himself next to the 
forbidden fruit, made fierce love to the youngest lady 
and her father's oldest port during the repast. 

No sooner was this over, and the gentlemen on 

their way to the drawing-room, than Mr. S , now 

in a perfect fever, hurried the young gentleman into 
his private room, the door of which was scarcely closed 
when he exclaimed, "Well, Mr. Sturt, how can you 
possibly save me ten thousand pounds? " " Why, 
sir," said the gallant five-and-threepence (sad odds in 
favour of six-and-eightpence), " they say in the town 
that you will, on their marriage, give your daughters 

twenty thousand pounds apiece; now, Mr. S , I 

will take either of them with ten." Tradition has not 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 219 

preserved the indignant town-clerk's reply, but Sturt is 
said to have lost no time in returning to the barracks 
and claiming the bet. Charles Sturt, of Brownsea, 
married Lady Anne Ashley, daughter of Anthony, 
fourth Earl of Shaftesbury, and died May 12, 1812. 

But to return from this long digression to Lord 
John. To judge by the succeeding verses, it was not 
unusual for him to amuse himself and his friends with 
the real or imaginary flirtations of his acquaintances. 
In this pastime it is highly probable that he received 
every encouragement from the witty and beautiful 
"rival sisters," and it is to .the effect that Lady 
Bessborough's transcendent charms had upon the fiery 
temperament of the gentleman, in whose name he 
addressed the following lines to her, that we owe this 
original and extraordinary squib. In those days 
there was a race of clergymen, now happily extinct, 
whose unclerical habits and language were open to the 
most serious animadversions from those who respected 
their calling; and it is not, therefore, very surprising 
if they occasionally fell under the satirical lash of a 
witty man of the world, who, in all probability, would 
never have exercised it upon a worthy member of the 
profession. If the leading features of this pasquinade 
be true, Lord John's victim had little to complain of; 
still the verses would not have been introduced here 
if the author had not ascertained that the reverend 
gentleman, who died at Ely in 1803, left no child or 
near relation to whom the publication of them would 
have given pain.

LORD JOHN TOWNSHEND. 

" Behold the fatal hour approach, — 
Adieu ! the destined dilly's come; 

D-----d be the dilly, curst the coach ! 

The coachman curst that drives me home ! 
And must I live, — oh, d — n the life ! — 
Live without you, and with my wife. 
But who, my Lady, who can tell, 
If you will ever think of Pell? 

Still shall I trace in dreams my fair 
To operas, plays, assemblies, balls; 
How this Lord flies to find your chair, 
How t'other for your footman calls. 
I start, I waken at the sound, 
While fancied flambeaux blaze around — 
But who, my Lady, who can tell, 
If you will ever think of Pell? 

When Sunday's summons claims the priest, 
Far from his flock the wretch shall stray, 
Where foot of man, nor foot of beast, 
Or guides his step, or marks his way. 
There lost, to woods and wilds he sighs; 
Here d — ns his blood, and bl — s his eyes ! 
But who, my Lady, who can tell, 
If you will ever think of Pell? 

By verdant Jewin's silver streams, 
Oft shall my listless length recline; 
While pensive memory fondly dreams, 
A thousand joys that once were mine. 
Tears, such as devils weep, shall flow, 
With oaths that none but parsons know. 
But who, my Lady, who can tell, 
If you will ever think of Pell? 


BE A U BR UMMELL. 22 1 

Here, breathed I many an ardent vow, 

Here, as you chanced — blest chance !— to pass 

I said with a pathetic bow l — 

' Miladi, voulez vous le bras? ' 

Here, wooed your hand with gentle squeeze, 

Here, popp'd down plump upon my knees 

But who, my Lady, who can tell, 

If you will ever think of Pell? 

Lo ! at your toilet as you sit, 

Lordlings and embryo statesmen wait; 

There love, and politics, and wit, 

In motley coterie debate ! 

While these young dogs, and millions more 

Day after day besiege your door, 

Ah ! who, my Lady, who can tell, 

If you will ever think of Pell? 

Think in my breast what wild despair, 
What rash tumultuous passions rise ! 
Think of your glossy auburn hair, 
Your pearly teeth, your hazel eyes ! 
Think how this barbarous last adieu, 
Robs me of peace, of life, of you ! 
Think— think, but I'll be d— n'd to hell, 
If you will ever think of Pell." 

Such are the amusing evidences of Lord John 
Townshend's wit and humour that I found in Brum- 
mell's album, which are characterised by a spirit of 
playful rather than malignant satire. In the heyday 
of youth, and even in manhood, when engaged in the 
turmoil of politics, and surrounded by the excitements 
of that brilliant society by which he was courted and 

1 Probably Lord John was thinking of Tickell's description of him, 
already alluded to in this chapter.

admired, he had little time, or perhaps disposition, 
for reflection; and the last preceding stanzas were no 
doubt written at the earlier period. But a strong con- 
trast to them is presented in the next and last example 
of his poetical talent, and, greatly is the estimate that 
we should have formed of his character, elevated by 
the impression, that .these lines leave upon the reader's 
mind; they evince, not only how deep and sincere 
were his parental feelings, but also those religious 
ones, which, as he himself observes, were " to cheer 
his closing day." In the evening of life, Lord John 
Townshend was visited by several heavy domestic 
trials, having lost three children; one of them was the 
godson of his friend Charles Fox, and named after 
him. The first of these afflictions was the death of a 
favourite daughter, and this melancholy event he thus 
feelingly records : — 


"TO THE MEMORY OF GEORGIANA ISABELLA TOWNSHEND, 
WHO DIED ON THE I7TH OF SEPTEMBER l8ll, IN THE 

TWENTY-FIRST YEAR OF HER AGE. 

BY HER FATHER. 

" Oh ! gone for ever — loved, lamented child ! 
So young, so good, so innocent and mild, 
With winning manners, beauty, genius, sense, 
Fond filial love, and sweet benevolence; 
The softest, kindest heart, yet firmest mind; 
In sickness patient, and in death resign'd j 
Never, oh ! never yet a fairer bloom 
Of opening virtues found an early tomb ! 
How hard thy trials, how severe thy woes, 
She, she alone, thy sorrowing mother knows, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 223 

Who, three long years, with sad foreboding heart, 
Bankrupt of every hope from human art, 
Still wept and watch'd, and still to Heaven for aid, 
Her fruitless vows with meek devotion paid. 
But thou, pure spirit ! fled to endless rest, 
Dear child ! my heart — Dear Bella ! thou art blest. 
And oh ! the thought that we again may meet ! 
Oh ! not another gleam of hope so sweet 
Dawns on thy father's breast with welcome ray, 
To soothe his grief, and cheer his closing day. " 

It was after reading this natural and affecting 
epitaph that the author, deeply impressed by its 
beauty, though unskilled in verse, wrote the following 
lines; they have no poetical merit, but may meet with 
charitable criticism from the many, and interest the 
sympathies of some, who have passed through the 
same ordeal as himself. They commemorate the death 
of Edgar, who was born at Odessa, in South Russia, 
and died there suddenly on the /th of March 1840. 

THE FOREIGN GRAVE. 

" Traveller, why shed the tear? — the flowing sails 
Are spread, and fill'd by favouring gales ! 
Why sad and pensive thus, when, high and bright, 
Old England's cliffs rise proudly on your sight? 
When all around is gaiety and mirth, 
Why listless view the land that gave you birth? 

The Traveller paused — then on his friend, his bride, 
He threw an earnest glance, and thus replied : — 
' Stranger, think not that with regret I view 
Those headlands bold — to England I am true ! 
On mouldering Rome I've gazed with deep delight, 
On Marathon look'd down from dark Pentelic's height;

And wandering on with ardour unsubdued, 

Symplegades I pass'd, and Euxine rude; 

But not fair Hellas, with her southern smile, 

Compares with yonder gem — our sea-girt isle. 

To me that bay, that crag and inlet deep, 

Are old familiar friends, yet still I weep; 

For as we journey'd, full of hope and joy, 

Death cross'd our cloudless path — we lost our boy ! 

With aching heart, his beauteous frame I bore 

To the wild steppe on bleak Odessa's shore; 

And there, where in the field of death is seen 

A small enclosure, with its gate of green, 

I laid him down : it was the place of rest 

Of friends, who in that land I loved the best. 

I look'd into the grave, the snow had drifted there; 

Oh ! what a winding-sheet for one so fair ! 

Though from his lips no word our ears could greet, 

His glance was language, and his smile was sweet. 

When last I saw his tranquil little face, 

'Twas nestled in his mother's fond embrace; 

So warm, so rosy, cast in such a mould ! 

Now wreathed in snow, inanimate and cold. 

In foreign accents rose the burial hymn; 

My eyes were fill'd — ay to the very brim — 

No simple floweret decks that infant's tomb, 

Nature denies the daisy there to bloom; 

But near the wall a small acacia grows, 

Which o'er the grave a transient shadow throws. 

No sculptured marble decorates the spot — 

Think you that cherub-boy is then forgot? 

Oh no ! so long as life and sense are ours, 

His loss will tinge with gloom our gayest hours; 

Tombs must, like man, decay; the foaming wave 

May, in some ages hence, that churchyard lave; 

Perhaps its mounds invade, and with rude hand 

Sweep every trace away, and leave a sand 

Stranger ! 'tis for my child these tears I shed; 
Our hearts are on the Euxine with the Dead ! ' " 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 225 

Towards the close of his life, Lord John Townshend 
spent much of his time at Brighton, where he was 
greatly respected, and received many and marked 
attentions from his late Majesty. He died on the 
25th of February 1833, in the seventy-seventh year of 
his age.

CHAPTER XVII. 

Estimation in which [ Brummell was held by Clever Men — The Poet 
Crabbe's Opinion of him — The Butterfly 's Funeral — Brummell the 
Author of it — Julia Storer — The Beau's Verses on her Child — An 
Anecdote from the Clubs of London — A Rencontre behveen Sheridan 
and Brummell — Sheridan 's Fugitive Poetry — Lines Addressed to the 
Countess of Bessborough — Tom Sheridan — The Loss of the Saldanha 
Frigate — His Stanzas on the Event — Lines to Julia, 

THAT Brummell possessed a refined taste, not merely 
in dress and manners, but on subjects more worthy of 
his intellect, is proved by his being admitted on 
intimate terms to the society of such women as the 
late Duchesses of Devonshire and Rutland; and men 
whose pursuits were of a much higher order than 
those of the idlers of Watier's, or the flaneurs of Bond 
Street and St. James's. Had he indeed been nothing 
better than an elegant automaton, he would never have 
acquired the influence that he decidedly obtained; he 
would not have enjoyed the society of clever men, 
neither would they have thought it worth their while 
to bestow a word upon him, even in their moments 
of relaxation. — But the reverse was the case : his 
acquaintance was not limited to men of fashion only; 
it comprised a great portion of the most intellectual 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 227 

men of his time, and at what period of our history 
was there such a constellation of genii? 

His acquirements, of which I have already spoken, 
were sufficient to make him a most delightful accession 
to any society; his reading, though desultory, was 
extensive, and therefore he could always, in one way 
or other, take a respectable, if not a leading part in 
conversation; — that he showed admirable tact in 
adapting it to the taste of those in whose society he 
might happen to be, appears by the testimony of men 
very superior to himself. In the Memoirs of the 
amiable Crabbe, his son observes, that his father, when 
visiting at Belvoir, "was particularly pleased and 
amused with the conversation of the celebrated Beau 
Brummell." The Quarterly Review, also, the Medo- 
Persianic lawgiver of literature, and the grindstone of 
mental reputations, actually acknowledged that he had 
talent; though it condemned him severely, and justly, 
for not having employed it in a more sensible and 
useful manner. 

Of his poetry, the following are specimens. The 
first, The Butterfly's Funeral, does not, it is true, 
possess the originality of Roscoe, or Mrs. Dorset, but 
it is an admirable effort in the same style as their 
poems, to which Brummell subsequently alludes. 
Though familiar to, and the delight of every child, 
these lines have hitherto been published under feigned 
initials, of which " B," however, was the last letter; 
but they have never been attributed to him. Mr. John 
Wallis, who, in 1804, first brought out this trifle, and 


228 THE LIFE OP 

printed three thousand copies of it, which were speedily 
sold, says, in his reply to my inquiry on the subject, 
" I cannot recollect whether I knew at the time who 
was the author of The Butterfly's Funeral; it is, 
however, very likely I may have received it direct from 
Mr. Brummell, for I knew, and was in the habit of 
seeing him, and other conspicuous characters about 
town, at the time I published that poem." 

Brummell sent these verses to a lady at Caen, and 
I subjoin the following extract from the letter that 
accompanied them. " But to change," he says, speak- 
ing of his miseries, " this larmoyant egotistical strain, 
I will transcribe you some verses that I have omitted 
in my album — they are not of the gayest subject; but 
never mind ! they were written at the period when 
The Peacock at Home,1 The Butterfly's Ball,2 and 
other trifling but meritorious poetical things of the 
same description, were in vogue with all the world in 
London : the Butterfly's Funeral was then commended 
by good-natured friends, and, as probably you never 
read it, should you like it, it may meet with the same 
charitable eulogy from you." 

THE BUTTERFLY'S FUNERAL. 

" Oh ye ! who so lately were blythesome and gay, 
At the Butterfly's banquet carousing away; 

1 The Peacock at Home was written by Mrs. Dorset, a sister of 
Charlotte Smith. 

* The Butterfly's Ball and Grasshopper's Feast was written by W. 
Roscoe, Esq., for his children, and set to music by order of their 
Majesties for the Princess Mary, afterwards Duchess of Gloucester. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 229 

Your feasts and your revels of pleasure are fled, 
For the soul of the banquet, the Butterfly's dead ! 

No longer the Flies and the Emmets advance, 

To join with their friend in the Grasshopper's dance; 

For see his thin form o'er the favourite bend, 

And the Grasshopper mourns for the loss of his friend. 

And hark ! to the funeral dirge of the Bee, 
And the Beetle, who follows as solemn as he; 
And see where so mournful the green rushes wave, 
The Mole is preparing the Butterfly's grave. 

The Dormouse attended, but cold and forlorn, 
And the Gnat slowly winded his shrill little horn; 
And the Moth, who was grieved for the loss of a sister, 
Bent over the body and silently kiss'd her. 

The corse was embalm'd at the set of the sun, 

And enclosed in a case which the Silk-worm had spun; 

By the help of the Hornet the coffin was laid 

On a bier out of myrtle and jessamine made. 

In weepers and scarves came the Butterflies all, 
And six of their number supported the pall; 
And the Spider came there, in his mourning so black, 
But the fire of the Glowworm soon frighten'd him back. 

The Grub left his nutshell, to join in the throng, 
And slowly led with him the Bookworm along; 
Who wept his poor neighbour's unfortunate doom, 
And wrote these few lines, to be placed on her tomb : — 


EPITAPH. 

At this solemn spot, where the green rushes wave, 
Here sadly we bent o'er the Butterfly's grave; 
'Twas here we to beauty our obsequies paid, 
And hallow'd the mound which her ashes had made. 


23o THE LIFE OF 

And here shall the daisy and violet blow, 

And the lily discover her bosom of snow; 

While under the leaf, in the evenings of spring, 

Still mourning his friend, shall the Grasshopper sing." 

The succeeding stanzas were also in the album, 
and Brummell asserts that they are his likewise; but 
a gentleman well read in the fugitive poetry of the 
last and present century, is not of that opinion, and 
thinks they have been published : he referred me to 
the collections of Dodsley, Nicholls, and Pearch, in 
which, however, I could not find them. It might be 
supposed that Brummell would scarcely have felt 
sufficient interest in the subject, to take up his pen 
either to transcribe or compose them; but whether 
he wrote them or not, if he only applied them to the 
circumstance to which they refer, he showed some 
feeling, and very good taste. He told the lady to 
whom he sent a copy, that he wrote them in 1806 for 
Julia Storer, whose unfortunate history I shall pass 
over in silence; — she died a few years after. 

" Unhappy child of indiscretion, 

Poor slumberer on a breast forlorn ! 

Pledge and reproof of past transgression, 

Dear, though unwelcome to be born. 

For thee, a suppliant wish addressing 
To Heaven, thy mother fain would dare; 

But conscious blushes stain the blessing, 
And sighs suppress my broken prayer : 

Yet, spite of these, my mind unshaken, 

In parent duty turns to thee; 
Though long repented, ne'er forsaken, 

Thy days shall loved and guarded be ! 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 231 

And though to rank and place a stranger 
Thy life an humble course must run; 

Still shall thou learn to fly the danger 
Which I, too late, have learnt to shun. 

And, lest the injurious world upbraid thee, 

For mine, or for thy father's ill; 
A nameless mother still shall aid thee — 

A hand unseen protect thee still. 

Meanwhile, in these sequester'd valleys 
Still shalt thou rest in calm content; 

For innocence may smile at malice, 
And thou, — oh ! thou art innocent ! " 


But, amongst all Brummell's friends, none con- 
tributed so largely as the Sheridan family to enrich 
his collection of poetry; there being in it three sets of 
stanzas by Mrs. Sheridan, two by Tom, and seventeen 
by Richard Brinsley. The following anecdote, however, 
taken from a work entitled, " The Clubs of London," l 
is scarcely consistent with the friendly terms on which 
he and Sheridan appear to have been, as shown by 
that paragraph of Brummell's letter, in which he 
mentions Sheridan as " one of those who, in other 
and happier days, gave him their minor productions 
before they had assumed any other form than that of 
manuscript." This author says, that " the wit, meet- 
ing Brummell one day near Charing Cross, and 
perceiving that he appeared anxious to avoid him, 

1 This is not the well-known work of the late John Timbs, "Club 
Life in London," which was published more than twenty years after 
the first edition of "The Life of Beau Brummell " had appeared. 


232 THE LIFE OF 

accosted him thus : ' Ah ! Brummell, my fine fellow, 
where have you been at this time of day? ' 

"The Prince of dandies was at first rather non- 
plussed, but at length drawled out, ' Sherry, my dear 
boy, don't mention that you saw me in this filthy part 
of the town; but perhaps I am rather severe, for his 
Grace of Northumberland resides somewhere about 
this spot, if I don't mistake. The fact is, my dear 
boy, I have been in the d-a-mn'd City — to the Bank : 
I wish they would remove it to the West End, for 
re-al-ly it is quite a bore to go to such a place; more 
particularly as one cannot be seen in one's own 
equipage beyond Somerset House, and the hackney 
coaches are not fit for a chimney-sweeper to ride in. 
Yes, my dear Sherry, you may note the circumstance 
down in your me-mo-randum-book, as a very remark- 
able one, that on the twentieth day of March, in the 
year of our Lord eighteen hundred and three, you 
descried me travelling from the east end of the town 
like a common citizen, who had left his counting-house 
for the day, in order to dine with his upstart wife and 
daughters at their vulgar residence in Brunswick 
Square.' When Brummell had concluded this affected 
rhapsody, Sheridan said — 

" ' Nay, my good fellow, travelling from the east ! 
after all, that is surely impossible; you must be 
joking.' 

"'Why, my dear boy, why?' demanded Brummell. 

" ' Because the wise men came from the east,' 
replied Sheridan. 


Richard J3rms/ey Sheridan. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 233 

" ' So then, s-a-r,' exclaimed the fop, ' you think 
me a fool, do you? ' 

" ' By no means/ answered Sheridan, turning 
away, ' but I know you to be one, and so, good 
morning.' 

" Brummell, like the equestrian statue just opposite 
to him, was struck dumb and motionless for a few 
seconds : at length he vociferated, ' I tell you what, 
my friend Sherry, I shall cut you for this impertinence, 
depend on't; I mean to send the Prince to Coventry 
for the next twelve months, and you shall accompany 
him.' Sheridan laughed heartily at the idea of being 
put under Brummell's imperial ban, and to the great 
amusement of the fellow of his excommunication an- 
nounced to him the woful tidings the same evening." 

That the first answer was really given by Brummell 
to some jocular remark of Sheridan's, as mentioned 
by the author of this work, is very possible; but there 
are circumstances in the details of the narrative which 
cast a doubt on the genuineness of the whole story. 
The "dear boying," and "dear Sherrying," are not 
like the Beau; nor did he ever drawl out his words, 
or " vociferate," in the manner here described; and 
though Brummell was not able to cope with Sheridan's 
wit, he would never have been struck dumb and 
motionless (by-the-bye, this is the first time I ever 
saw it intimated that this statue once possessed the 
powers of speech and motion), or have been so simple 
as to place himself in a position to be called a fool; 
neither is it at all credible that the orator would have 


234 THE LIFE OF 

made such a vulgar speech, more particularly with- 
out the slightest provocation. 

The principal part of the poetical trifles that Sheridan 
sent to Brummell have been already published; but 
the following interesting fragments of the versatile 
genius of that clever man have not, I think, met the 

public eye. 

R. B. SHERIDAN. 

" The poorest peasant of the poorest soil, 
The child of poverty, and heir to toil, 
Early from radiant Love's impartial light, 
Steals one small spark to cheer his world of night. 
Dear spark ! that oft through Winter's chilling woes 
Is all the warmth his little cottage knows. 
The wandering tar, who not for years has prest, 
The widow'd partner of his day of rest; 
On the cold deck, far from her arms removed, 
Still hums the ditty which his Susan loved. 
The soldier, fairly proud of wounds and toil, 
Pants for the triumph of his Nancy's smile : 
But ere the battle, should he hear her cries, 
The lover trembles and the hero dies. 
That heart, by war and honour steel'd to fear, 
Droops at a sigh, and sickens at a tear." 

TO THE COUNTESS OF BESSBOROUGH. 

" When memory, chill'd by absence, shall decay, 
And love's first warm impression fade away, 
Oh ! may this sketch, with more than mimic art, 
Recall the living likeness to your heart; 
Revive affection, threatening to decline, 
And while it pleads my faith, recover thine." 

ON FEMALE INFLUENCE. 

" In female hearts, did sense and merit rule, 
The lover's mind would ask no other school; 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 235 

Shamed into sense, the scholars of your eyes, 
Our beaux from gallantry would soon be wise; 
Would gladly light, their homage to improve, 
The lamp of knowledge at the torch of love." 


TO . 

" Dear object of my late and early prayer, 
Source of my joy, and solace of my care, 
Whose gentle friendship such a charm can give, 
As makes me wish, and tells me how to live; 
To thee the Muse with grateful hand would bring, 
These first fair flowers of the doubtful Spring. 
Oh, may they, fearless of the varying sky, 
Bloom on thy breast, and smile beneath thine eye, 
In fairer lights their vivid blue display, 
And sweeter breathe their little lives away." 


TO 


" The stricken deer that in his velvet side, 

Feels at each step the trembling arrow play, 
In shades of thickest covert loves to hide, 

And from the cruel hunter speeds away. — 
But I, more wounded than the stricken deer, 

Scarce wish from my destroyer's aim to fly — 
I weep, but 'tis, alas ! too soft a tear, 

And e'en my groans are mingled with a sigh." l 

ON A CHILD. 

" In some rude spot where vulgar herbage grows, 

If chance a violet rear its purple head, 
The careful gardener moves it ere it blows, 
To thrive and flourish in a nobler bed. 
Such was thy fate, dear child ! 
Thy opening such ! 

1 See Pope's lines on his love for Lady Mary Wortley Montague. 


236 THE LIFE OF 

Pre-eminence in early bloom was shown; 

For earth too good, perhaps, 

And loved too much — 
Heaven saw, and mark'd thee for its own." l 

DELUSION, PHANTOM, AND FICTION. 

" In Britain's sad hour of grief and contention, 
The three new estates fairly met in convention; 
'Twas to help the poor country's distracted condition 
And of royal authority make a partition. 
Delusion's attorney, lest things might grow worse, 
Laid claim to his household, his peers, and his purse : 
' You're right,' exclaim'd Phantom, ' I'll serve you with zeal, 
But, remember, I'm keeper of him and his seal.' 
Quoth Fiction, ' My object with yours quite accords; 
So I rule the proceedings of Commons and Lords; ' 
The physicians all said, the decision was fair; 
But old Anarchy swore he'd put in for his share." 

The next stanzas are by Tom Sheridan, whose 
name, alas ! at the moment I am writing, excites the 
most melancholy reflections; for death has recently 
dealt severely indeed with his kindred. His brother, 
the last of his own generation, died lately; and in the 
same newspaper was announced the death of poor 
Frank, his son, the gayest, the wittiest, and the idlest 
of pleasure-loving beings; he also " has shuffled off 
this mortal coil," and in a foreign country. Every 
one, as I have often seen, did their best to spoil him; 
therefore it was not extraordinary that he had many 
foibles; but there was a large balance of generous 
qualities in his character, which, as he was his own 

1 This seems a reminiscence of Mallet's ballad " Edwin and Emma," 
in which occurs the line, " Heaven saw and marked her for its own." 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 237 

enemy, and never other people's, will not fail to out- 
weigh the remembrance of his faults and infirmities. 
Both father and son died abroad; the former, at the 
Cape of Good Hope, on the I2th of September 1817; 
the latter, at the Mauritius, in the autumn of 1843. 

Both of these pieces of poetry, by Tom Sheridan, 
who had much of the convivial wit of his father, are 
of a far more original character than any verses that 
Richard Brinsley ever composed. The first was 
written shortly after the wreck of the Saldanha frigate, 
commanded by the Honourable William Pakenham, 
brother of the second Earl of Longford, who, with his 
officers and the whole of the ship's company, amount- 
ing to three hundred men, were lost off the coast of 
Ireland, on the night of the 4th of December 1811. 
The Saldanha was a new frigate, one of the finest in 
the navy, and her commander, a rising officer of the 
highest character, was only in his twenty-ninth year. 
This dreadful catastrophe is thus recorded in the 
Annual Register : — 

" RATHMILTON, December the 6th. — His Majesty's 
ship, Saldanha, Captain the Honourable William 
Pakenham, sailed from Cork on the iQth of Novem- 
ber, to relieve H.M. ship Endymion, off Lough S willy; 
and having reached that harbour, she, with the 
Endymion and Talbot, sailed on the 3Oth inst., with 
an intention, it is said, of proceeding to the westward; 
on the 3rd of December it blew very hard from the 
north-west; the wind continued to increase till the 
4th, and in the evening and night of that day, it blew 


238 THE LIFE OF 

the most dreadful hurricane that the inhabitants of 
this part of the country ever recollected. At about 
ten o'clock at night, through the darkness and the 
storm, a light was seen from the signal-towers, pass- 
ing rapidly up the harbour, the gale then blowing 
right in. This light, it was supposed, was on board 
the Saldanha; but this is only conjecture; for, when 
the daylight discovered the ship a complete wreck in 
Ballyna Stokerbay, on the west side of the harbour, 
every soul on board had already perished, and all 
knowledge of the circumstances of her calamitous loss 
thus perished with her." The bodies of Captain 
Pakenham and two hundred of the crew were washed 
ashore, and the only living thing that escaped on this 
dreadful occasion is said to have been a parrot, 
belonging to one of the officers. 

THE LOSS OF THE SALDANHA. 

T. SHERIDAN. 

" ' Britannia rules the waves :' 

Heard'st thou that dreadful roar? 
Hark ! 'tis bellow'd from the caves 

Where Lough Swilly's billow raves, 
And three hundred British graves 

Taint the shore. 

No voice of life was there, 
;Tis the dead that raise the cry; — 

The dead, who heard no prayer, 
As they sunk in wild despair, 

Chaunting in scorn that boastful air, 

Where they lie. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 239 

' Rule Britannia,' sung the crew, 

When the stout Saldanha sail'd; 
And her colours, as they flew, 

Flung the warrior-cross to view, 
Which, in battle, to subdue 

Ne'er had fail'd. 

Bright rose the laughing morn, 

That morn that seal'd her doom; — 
Dark and sad is her return, 

And the storm-lights faintly burn, 
As they toss upon her stern, 

'Mid the gloom. 

From the lonely beacon height, 

As the watchmen gazed around, 
They saw their flashing light 

Drive swift athwart the night; 
Yet the wind was fair, and right 

For the Sound. 

But no mortal power shall now 

That crew and vessel save; 
They are shrouded as they go 

In a hurricane of snow — 
And the track beneath her prow 

Is their grave. 

There are spirits of the deep, 

Who, when the warrant's given, 
Rise raging from their sleep 

On a rock or mountain steep, 
Or 'mid thunder clouds, that keep 

The wrath of Heaven. 

High the eddying mists are whirl'd, 

As they near their giant forms; 
See their tempest flags unfurl'd ! 

Fierce they sweep the prostrate world; 
And the withering lightning's hurl'd 

Through the storm. 


240 THE LIFE OF 

O'er Swilly's rocks they soar, 
Commission'd watch to keep; 

Down, down with thundering roar 
The exulting demons pour — 

The Saldanha floats no more 

On the deep ! 

The dreadful hest is past, 

All is silent as the grave, 
One shriek is first and last — 

Scarce a death-sob drank the blast, 
As sunk the quivering mast 

'Neath the wave. 

' Britannia rules the waves; ' 

Oh vain and impious boast ! 
Go, mark, presumptuous slaves, 

Where He who sinks or saves, 
Scars the sands with countless graves, 

Round your coast." 

The following are on a very different theme, and 
in striking contrast to the preceding. 

TO JULIA. 

" Since you will needs my heart possess, 
Julia, 'tis just I first confess 

The faults to which 'tis given; 
It is much more to change inclined 
Than restless seas or raging wind, 

Or aught that's under Heaven. 

Nor will I hide from you the truth, 
It has been from its very youth 

A most egregious ranger; 
And, since from me it oft has fled, 
With whom it was both born and bred, 

'Twill scarce stay with a stranger. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 241 

The black, the fair, the gay, the sad, 
It is so very, very mad, 

With one kind look can win it; 
By nature 'tis so prone to rove, 
'Twill quit success, for change, in love, 

And what's more, glories in it. 

And now, if you dare be so bold, 
After the truths that I have told, 

To like this arrant rover; 
Be not displeased, if I confess 
I think the heart within your breast 

Will prove just such another."

AMONGST the long list of distinguished persons who 
sent vers de societe to Brummell, Lady Dacre, Lady 
Granville, and Lord Melbourne, are the only three 
individuals who now survive, and consequently the 
only persons to whom it was necessary to apply for 
permission to publish these evidences of their taste 
and accomplishments.1 The reply that I received 
from Lord Melbourne was couched in terms of amiable 
circumspection, and perfectly in accordance with his 
known good-nature; he says, " I can have no objec- 
tion to your inserting any poetry of mine in your 
intended work, which you think may add to its inte- 
rest, provided there be in it nothing discreditable to 
the writer, nor injurious to the feelings of others; on

BEAU BRUMMBLL. 243 

both of which points, you will exercise a sound dis- 
cretion." No objections of this nature can possibly 
be urged against the first, or the three succeeding 
trifles from his lordship's pen : they were probably 
written very early in life, and had been the elegant 
occupation of leisure hours passed, in reality, by the 
side of the tranquil Cam; but, in imagination, repos- 
ing on the banks of some streamlet wild in the classic 
island of Cythera. His lordship had, however, even 
at this time, not only distinguished himself by his 
classical, but by other and more solid attainments; 
and perhaps, the most flattering testimony of this was 
given by Fox, when he made his celebrated speech 
on the death of his friend the Duke of Bedford — one of 
the finest declamations of the heart ever made within 
the walls of the House of Commons. On that memor- 
able occasion, he finished his painful task by introduc- 
ing the following passage from the Essay of William 
Lamb, " Sur 1'Avancement Progressif de 1'Esprit 
Humain; " recited at the University of Cambridge in 
December 1798: " Le crime n'est un fldau que pour 
le temps ou le succes le couronne, tandis que la vertu, 
soit qu'elle triomphe soit qu'on la persecute, est un 
bienfait du ciel, non seulement pour 1'age ou nous 
vivons, mais pour la poste"rit6 la plus recule"e; elle 
sert au bonheur des hommes, dans le moment present 
par ses actions, et dans 1'avenir par ses exemples." 
Lord Melbourne's admiration for this great, though 
unsuccessful, statesman, is powerfully and simply ex- 
pressed in the following apostrophe to his bust. 


244 THE LIFE OF 

ON THE BUST OF CHARLES JAMES FOX. 

" Live, marble, live ! for thine's a sacred trust, 
The patriot's name that speaks a noble mind; 
Live, that our sons may stand before thy bust, 
And hail the benefactor of mankind ! 
This was the man, who, 'midst the tempest's rage, 
A mark of safety to the nation stood; 
Wam'd with prophetic voice a servile age, 
And strove to quench the ruthless thirst for blood. 
This was the man, whose ever deathless name 
Recalls his generous life's illustrious scenes; 
To bless his fellow-creatures was his aim — 
And universal liberty his means ! " 

The three succeeding pieces were also from his 
lordship's pen. 

THE DREAM. 

i: Hide, Sun, thy head ! delay thy light. 
And yield to Love's befriending night 
Some portion of thy sway; 
I would not change the airy form, 
Which seems to meet me kind and warm, 
For all the blaze of day. 

In vain I sue — stern Fate denies : 
My slumbers break, the Vision flies, 

I lose my Laura's charms; 
That taper waist, that bosom fair, 
Dissolving into empty air, 

Eludes my eager arms. 

No wretch, his day of respite done, 
Who sees his last uprising sun 
And only wakes to die, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 245 

Curses the light with so much pain, 
And weeps, and sighs to sleep again, 
So ardently as I. 

Invidious light ! my hated bane, 
Why rudely break the ideal chain 

On which my raptures hung? 
I saw sweet Laura's angel grace, 
My eyes were fix'd upon her face, 

My soul upon her tongue. 

Her rosy lips I seemed to press, 
Nor seemed the maid my fond caress 

By frowns to disapprove; 
I heard her voice so sweet, so clear, 
Sound music to my ravish'd ear, 

For it express'd her love. 

Smile, then, sweet Laura ! let me find, 
For once, reality as kind 

As golden visions seem; 
For it has been my lot to rue, 
That all my sorrows still were true, 

And all my joys a dream." 

The following ode was translated by a Mr. Shepherd 
— see the " Poetical Register" for 1810 — or rather do 
not see it, for the translation is sadly inferior. 

TRANSLATION FROM ANACREON, 

WHO CALLS UPON SOME EMINENT ARTIST TO PAINT HIS 
MISTRESS. 

A-ye, 


" Come, Painter, who with skilful hand 
Canst rival even Nature's art; 


246 THE LIFE OF 

Come, Painter, draw, as I command, 
The absent mistress of my heart. 

Paint first each soft and jetty tress, 
With which her graceful head is crown'd; 

If colours can so much express, 

Oh ! paint them breathing odours round. 

Above her cheek, full, lovely, fair, 

Where modest blushes reddening glow, 

Beneath her mildly curling hair, 
Describe with skill her ivory brow. 

Ah ! how to imitate her face 

Thy chiefest science will be tried; 

Between her brows the middle space 
Nor quite confound nor quite divide. 

Here let the eyelid's lash be shown; 

Here let her semblance bear complete, 
Dark arching eyebrows like her own, 

Which meeting, scarcely seem to meet. 

But, Painter, do not here forget 
To give her eye its native flame, 

Azure, Minerva-like, and yet, 

As melting as the Paphian dame. 

Her nose and cheek then fashion well — 
That white as milk, and roseate this : 

Her lips, like soft Persuasion's swell, 
Pouting and challenging the kiss. 

Beneath her chin, where dimples play, 
About her neck of Parian stone, 

Let all the Loves and Graces stray; 
That happy spot is all their own. 

But oh ! those beauties of my fair, 
Which I alone must e'er reveal, 

Come, Painter, with the strictest care 
Beneath the purple robe conceal. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 247 

Yet sometimes let the skin of snow 
Through the thin garment's covering shine, 

And faintly tell what beauties glow 
Unseen by any eyes but mine. 

Enough, enough ! upon my sight 
Her charms with dazzling lustre break; 

She seems to breathe ! with fond delight 
I pause, for she ere long will speak." 


" Come, Painter, Love demands thy care, 

Thy strongest, brightest powers command, 
Thy most unfading lines prepare, 

Thy finest eye, and happiest hand. 
For though I oft have seen to grow, 

Beneath thy touch, the mimic face; 
Have seen thy magic pencil throw 

Upon the canvas living grace; 
This task must e'en thy labour foil, 

Unequal all thy skill must prove; 
This task will mock thy utmost toil, 

I think thou canst not paint my Love. 
Thy pencil — thine alone — may reach 

The charms that fav'ring beauty gave, 
And thou, like her, perhaps, may'st teach 

The cheek to blush, the hair to wave; — 
But ah ! a lover more requires 

Than waving hair, and blushing cheeks; 
He asks the idea his flame inspires, 

The form that lives, the face that speaks : 
He asks that brow that teems with sense, 

The feature with expression fraught; 
The eye that beams intelligence, 

The pregnant glance, and silent thought. 
He asks that lip that seems to swell 

With love it does not dare reveal; 
He asks that eye that fears to tell 

The pleasing tale it can't conceal. 


248 THE LIFE OF 

Oh ! couldst thou trace the gentle heart, 

As in her features it is shown ! — 
But here, unpractised in thy art — 

That charm, my Love, is thine alone ! " 

There were two or three other fragments of Lord 
Melbourne's poetry; and one of them, written in his 
brother's pocket-book, after Mr. Lamb had recovered 
from a dangerous illness, offers a pleasing testimony 
of the friendship that existed between them. This 
gentleman, well known to the world as the author of 
a translation of Catullus, appears also to have added 
several pieces of his composition to Brummell's collec- 
tion; and the following very original song is the 
happiest effort amongst them. At the period of his 
death, which took place in London on the 2 3rd of 
January 1834, in the forty-ninth year of his age, Mr. 
Lamb was Under Secretary of State for the Home 
Department. 

THE ROBBER'S GOOD-NIGHT. 

GEORGE LAMB. 

" The goblet is empty, and toll'd are the chimes, 
Sleep hides from mankind both its sorrows and crimes; 
And, in quiet repose till the dawning of day, 
The guilty and honest, the wretched and gay. 

The guilty can sleep, though terrific, 'tis said, 
The dreams and the ghosts that encircle their bed; 
But he who a victim's last curses can bear, 
Will not shrink from the bodiless spectres of air. 

The wretched can sleep, for the bosom is worn, 

The heart'has grown dull with the weight it has borne; 


"^•^v-^ 


T/2e Hon.b'e George Lamb. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 249 

More sweet are the visions in slumber that live, 
Than the mournful realities daylight can give. 

Yes ! the goblet is drain'd, and its floods in their course 
Have drown'd all reflection, regret, and remorse; 
And shall spread o'er my pallet as tranquil a rest, 
As the moralist paints on the couch of the blest.!: 

There were likewise the following verses by Payne 
Knight, the author of "Taste," and one of the most 
eminent Greek scholars of his day. At his death, 
which took place at his house in Soho Square, on the 
28th of April 1834, he bequeathed his collection of 
medals, drawings, and bronzes, worth more than thirty 
thousand pounds, to the British Museum. Amongst 
the drawings was a volume of Claude's, for which Mr. 
Knight gave sixteen hundred pounds to a person, 
who, a few days before, had purchased it for three 
pounds ! 

THE YELLOW LEAF. 

R. P. KNIGHT. 

" Round flew the bowl, the laugh rose high, 
Whilst summer's richest canopy, 
The wedded boughs of emerald dye, 

Was all our shade. 

So soft the air, so gay the plain, 
Though August's moon was in her wane, 
We said that summer's verdant reign 

Would never cease. 

High rose the laugh, the transports swell, 
When sudden, potent as a spell, 
Detach'd by no rude zephyr, fell 

One yellow leaf ! 


250 THE LIFE OF 

The mirth was hush'd, the songsters' lays 
Broke short; and each in solemn gaze 
Hung on the leaf, nor dared to raise 

A timorous eye; 

Each fear'd, upon the other's face 
His own sad feelings writ, to trace, 
As the pale emblem spoke the race 

Of summer run. 

It seem'd some fairy, throned in air, 
Had mark'd our bliss, and pausing there, 
Dismiss'd a monitor to bear 

Truth to each heart. 

To tell us that the scene might glow, 

But soon should change in cheerless snow, 

To tell us that our bliss should know 

An autumn too. 

That joys but coming sorrow speak, 
As calms precede the tempest bleak, 
That death his surest victim's cheek 

With roses paints. 

Yes, in that moment, on that day, 
Reflection stole my smiles away; 
And, like him, weeping to survey 

His myriad bands, 

Methought, ere many a year goes round, 
Few may, of us, who on this ground 
Now gaily revel, few be found 

To meet again. 

The young before the old may go; 
And he who bids this measure flow 
May fall, perhaps, the first, to show 

This moral true." 


BE A U BR VMMELL. 2 5 1 

I will close this chapter with the following lines of 
George Canning's and some by Mrs. O'Neill, also from 
the scrap-book : the former do not certainly impair 
the force and truth of Mr. Lockhart's remark on his 
satirical powers. " No man," he says, " ever pos- 
sessed a gayer wit in society than he did; his lash 
fetched away both skin and flesh, and would have 
penetrated the hide of a rhinoceros : " it would indeed 
have penetrated the hide of that animal, and tanned. 
I have not found these lines amongst Canning's pub- 
lished poems. They were written on Mr. Whitbread's 
speech at the opening of the impeachment of Viscount 
Melville in 1805, of which trial Chief Baron Thompson 
observed, that he had " heard of an ' impeachment of 
waste/ but that these proceedings were, in his humble 
opinion, a waste of impeachment." Many were the 
droll stories that the amiable old judge had to tell 
of this trial, and that of the famous one of Warren 
Hastings; at which he used to assure his delighted 
listeners, the juniors of the bar, that his Brother 
Gould, when proceeding with great solemnity to take 
his place at the spot appointed for the judges, sat 
down on one of the heralds, — who was so disguised 
by his tabard, that he mistook him for a state chair 1

Would you know why th' eleventh of June I remember. 

Much better than April, or March, or November? 

'Twas because on that day ('tis with pride I assure ye) 

My sainted progenitor took to his Brewery. 

That morn he began his first brewing of beer, 

That evening commenced his connubial career : 

On that day he died, having finished his summing, 

And the angels cried, 'Look! here's old Whitbread a-coming.' 

So that day I hail with a smile and a sigh, 

For his beer with an E, and his bier with an I. 

And on that day each year, in the hottest of weather, 

The whole Whitbread family feast altogether. 

My Lords, while the beams of this hall shall support 

The roof which o'ershades this respectable court 

(Where Hastings was tried for oppressing the Hindoos), 

While the beams of the sun shall shine in at the windows, 

My name shall shine bright, as my father's now shines, 

Emblazon'd on Journals, as his is on Signs." 

A most extraordinary and touching circumstance 
closed the proceedings of this trial, which, however it 
may have flattered Lord Melville, did not perhaps 
afford him such unalloyed gratification as it did amuse- 
ment to his brother peers. It is said that when his 
acquittal was pronounced, the eccentric Duchess of 
Gordon, his countrywoman, rose from her seat, and 
with a warmth of feeling, which made every particular 
hair of his lordship's ermine stand on end, rushed 
forward and kissed him ! — exclaiming, in no very 
subdued tone, " Weel, my lord, I'm very glad to see 
that we have at least one honest mon in this hoose." 

Henrietta Boyle, the authoress of the amusing 
verses that conclude this chapter, born in 1758, was 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 253 

the only daughter of Charles, Viscount Dungarvon, 
eldest son of John, fifth Earl of Cork. On the 1 8th of 
October 1777, she married John O'Neil, Esq., of Shanes 
Castle, near Antrim, in the streets of which town he 
was cruelly and brutally piked by the rebels in 1798. 

MRS. O'NEILL. 

" Ere raging seas between us roll, 
Oh come and soothe my tortured soul ! 

Return once more to me; 
Come, and each anxious fear remove, 
Speak peace, and tell me that you love, 

And bid me live for thee. 
Come, and my wayward fancy cheat, 
Persuade me by some dear deceit 

That long I shall not mourn; 
Calm all my woes, subdue my sighs, 
By some sweet lawful perjuries, 

And be for once forsworn. 

Swear, that ere three eternal weeks, 
You'll kiss the tear from off my cheeks, 

Though you mean twice the time; 
Swear, that for worlds you would not be, 
Another day or hour from me, — 

Love will absolve the crime." 

Mrs. O'Neill died on the 3rd of September 1793, 
and her husband was created a peer on the 3Oth of 
November following. This accomplished lady wrote 
some interesting poetry, amongst which, under the 
name of Geraldine Verney, was an Ode to the Poppy, 
originally printed in her friend Charlotte Smith's novel 
of " Desmond," and subsequently in the Rev. A. 
Dyce's " Specimens of British Poetesses."

CHAPTER XIX. 

" Wales, ring the Ml" — The Real Delinquent— BrummelTs Quarrel 
with the Prince of Wales — Causes that Led to it — Ben and Benina 
— Mrs. Fiizherbert — The Beau's Impudence — " Who's your Fat 
Friend?" — Brummell's Intimacy with the Duke of York — Letters 
from the Duchess to Brummell — Her great Partiality for Dogs — 
File at Oatlands—The Duke's Reply to his Servant— A Pastoral 
Dialogue by R. B, Sheridan — The Right Honourable George Rose. 

NOTWITHSTANDING the great disparity of rank, the 
intimacy that was formed between Brummell and the 
Prince of Wales continued for some years uninter- 
rupted. He was a constant guest at Carlton House, 
and was distinguished by many marks, never pecuniary 
ones, of his royal friend's partiality for him. At length 
however a rupture took place, but it was not caused 
by the circumstance to which it is usually attributed. 
The story of " Wales, ring the bell ! " was always 
denied by Brummell : indeed he seemed indignant at 
its being generally credited; and I have heard him, 
in explanation of the subject, say, " I was on such 
intimate terms with the Prince, that if we had been 
alone I could have asked him to ring the bell without 
offence; but with a third person in the room I should 
never have done so; I knew the Regent too well." 


BEAU BRUMMELL 355 

The vulgar impudence of the action itself, without 
Brummell's denial of it, makes the anecdote extremely 
improbable; and he was also too good a judge of his 
own interests, to run the risk of being turned out of 
the Prince's society for the mere fun of enacting such 
a piece of tomfoolery. 

Another version of the story is, that one evening, 
when Brummell and Lord Moira were engaged in 
earnest conversation at Carlton House, the Prince 
requested the former to ring the bell, and that he 
replied without reflection, " Your Royal Highness is 
close to it; " upon which the Prince rang the bell and 
ordered his friend's carriage, but that Lord Moira's 
intervention caused the unintentional liberty to be 
overlooked. 

This act of folly has, and I believe with more truth, 
been attributed to a young relation of Captain, after- 
wards Admiral Payne's,1 and under circumstances far 
more creditable to the Prince's good taste and good 
feeling. Admiral Payne, a wit and bon vivant, was 
comptroller of the household; and owing to the posi- 
tion he occupied, and his intimacy with the Prince, 
this lad, a midshipman in the navy, was sometimes 
asked to dine at Carlton House. Of course, boy-like, 
he boasted of the honour in the cock-pit; and one 
day, when rallied by his companions on the extremely

of the coasts of Devonshire and Cornwall, Treasurer of Greenwich 
Hospital, and Lord Warden of the Stannaries"; he died on the I7th of 
November 1803. 


256 THE LIFE OF 

easy terms that he represented himself to be upon 
with his royal friend, he made a bet, that, the next 
time he dined with the Prince, he would tell him to 
ring the bell. A few days after he was again invited 
to Carlton House, and having primed himself with 
champagne, actually did ask the Regent to ring the 
bell. His Royal Highness immediately complied, and 
when the page in waiting, or some other subordinate, 
made his appearance, said good-humouredly, " Put 
that drunken boy to bed." 

Brummell, as well as his friends, attributed his 
quarrel with the Prince of Wales to a series of sar- 
castic remarks, in which he had indulged at the 
expense of Mrs. Fitzherbert; indiscretions that he 
was led into by foolishly espousing the part of a 
noble lady, her rival; but his talent for ridicule once 
enlisted in her cause, he did not spare even the Prince 
himself. There was at that time a burly porter at 
Carlton House, nicknamed " Big Ben," who was so 
tall that he could look over the gates, and as the 
Regent was then increasing in size, Brummell often 
designated the master, by the appellation of the servant 
— and Mrs. Fitzherbert, by that of " Benina." ] It is 
also said, that he annoyed her by various remarks of 
the same kind; and that, when desired by the Regent 
at a ball at Lady Jersey's to call her carriage, he 
obeyed, but in doing so, substituted the word mistress 
for the usual one of Mrs., and laid a strong emphasis 
on the insulting epithet. If this anecdote is true, no

BEAU BRUMMELL. 257 

wonder that when it came to the lady's ears, as well 
as the Prince's, with the allusions to their embonpoint 
(upon which subject they were, as people frequently 
are, extremely sensitive), such ill-timed jokes were 
resented; and that Brummell was dismissed : — he 
always, however, considered that the continuation of 
the Regent's anger was owing to Mrs. Fitzherbert, 
whose absurd vanity in identifying herself with the 
Crown of England — for it was that or nothing — made 
her peculiarly unforgiving on this subject; and her 
dislike to Fox renders it probable that Brummell's 
opinion was correct. Moore, however, in a parody on 
a celebrated letter from the Prince Regent to the 
Duke of York, on the I3th of February 1812, gives 
the former the credit of all the indignation against 
Brummell, and adduces another well-known mot of 
the Beau's as the reason of it. 

" Neither have I resentments, nor wish there should come ill 
To mortal, except, now I think on't, Beau Brummell; 
Who threatened last year, in a superfine passion, 
To cut me, and bring the old King into fashion." 

But, whatever the causes of offence may have been 
that led to the quarrel, the Beau treated the affair 
with his usual assurance; and waging war upon his 
royal adversary, assailed him with ridicule in all 
quarters, and affected to say, that he had himself cut 
the connection : it was in this spirit, no doubt, that 
he said to Colonel McMahon, " I made him what he 
is, and I can unmake him." Of course, after this 
break, the Regent determined to take advantage of 

VOL. I. R 


258 THE LIFE OF 

the first opportunity that occurred, of showing the 
world that he was no longer anxious to continue the 
acquaintance. An occasion for his so doing presented 
itself not long after in a morning walk, when the 
Prince, leaning on Lord Moira's arm, met Brummell 
and Lord Alvanley, coming in the opposite direction, 
and, probably with the intention of making the cut 
more evident, His Royal Highness stopped and spoke 
to his Lordship, without noticing the Beau — little 
thinking that he would resent it; great therefore must 
have been his surprise and annoyance, as each party 
turned to continue their promenade, to hear him say 
in a distinct tone, expressive of complete ignorance of 
his person, " Alvanley, who's your fat friend? " But 
Brummell was sometimes in a humour to adduce other 
reasons than the right one for the fracas which led 
to his final rupture with the Regent, and the favourite 
fiction that he then palmed upon his most eager 
listeners was, that they had been rivals in a love 
affair, in which the Prince was of course the unsuc- 
cessful suitor. 

When Brummell found that His Royal Highness 
had really closed the doors of Carlton House against 
him, he cultivated with greater assiduity the friend- 
ship that had always existed between himself and the 
Duke of York, who was never known, in good or ill 
report, to desert a friend; and his conduct, and that 
of the Duchess, to the Beau in his exile, were strik- 
ing instances of the steadiness and sincerity of their 
1 See Vol. II., Appendix. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 259 

friendship. " The Duchess," says Mr. Raikes, " was a 
person of excellent taste, and a very nice discriminator 
of good breeding and manners, and the regard which 
that Princess entertained for Brummell was highly 
creditable to him. It may, indeed, be said in favour 
of the manners of that day, that Her Royal Highness 
often remarked how superior they were to the tone of 
those that existed at the period of her marriage, when 
the Duke was surrounded by a set of roue's who seemed 
to glory in their excesses, and showed a great want 
of refinement and courtesy in women's society. At 
the time Brummell visited at Oatlands, England had 
been for many years without a Court, and the limited 
circle that surrounded the Duke and Duchess of York, 
though differing scarcely from that of a private family, 
rendered it the only royal residence that was the 
scene of constant hospitality; and it might have been 
appropriately termed a little Court, in which the 
affability on the one side, and the affectionate defer- 
ence on the other, were equally remarkable. Here 
used to assemble, at the end of the week, Brummell, 
and all the most agreeable men of the day, intimately 
acquainted with each other, and sincerely attached to 
their royal host and hostess." 

I am ignorant of the precise dates at which the 
two following notes from the Duchess to Brummell 
were written; but they were copied by myself from 
her autograph, and are inserted as a proof that he 
must have stood high in her esteem, and that she 
corresponded with, and received him, on the most 


26o THE LIFE OF 

intimate footing. The first was written to acknow- 
ledge the receipt of a note announcing the loss of a 
lottery-ticket, which they had purchased together : the 
paragraph alluding to the chances of his future life is 
happily expressed, and the sincerity of the conclud- 
ing sentence was fully proved in after-years, by her 
generous conduct towards him when she had the pain 
of seeing that her good wishes turned out unavailing. 

" OATLANDS, ce 20 Septembre. 

" Vous avez une maniere si aimable d'annoncer les

BEAU BRUMMELL. 261 

The next note from Her Royal Highness was to 
thank him for remembering her fete-day, and send- 
ing her a beautiful little dog, which Brummell, with 
his usual good taste, had selected for his present in 
preference to anything else, knowing the passion his 
royal friend had for that animal. Her Royal Highness 
is said to have had at one time upwards of one 
hundred dogs at Oatlands, and she sometimes erected 
monuments over her special favourites; they are 
grouped round a fountain in the grounds in front of 
a grotto, to which, during the summer months, she 
frequently retired with her work or a book. It is, I 
believe, near this spot that the inhabitants of the 
parish in which Oatlands is situated erected a monu- 
ment to the memory of this amiable woman, to which 
the humblest amongst the parishioners spontaneously 
requested permission to contribute their mite.

Though the parties at Oatlands were generally, as 
I have before remarked, of a very unostentatious 
character, the Duchess's birthday was sometimes 
celebrated with great splendour, particularly the one 
of 1811, of which I have heard Brummell speak. 
The King and Princesses were present, and, after 
they left, the park-gates were thrown open to the 
public, consisting principally of the tenants and 
labourers in the neighbourhood, who assembled in 
the lower part of the house. Here tables were laid 
out with refreshments, which were soon cleared; and 
the punch, six quarts of which were pLced upon 
each, having freely circulated, at nine dancing com- 
menced, the Duchess leading off the first dance, called 
the Labyrinth, with Colonel, now General, Upton. 

It was by these unaffected examples of hospitality 
that the Duke endeared himself to high and low about 
him; and the numerous instances on record of his 
generous disposition, more particularly when in com- 
mand of the army, and his unvarying anxiety to 
promote the comfort of the most subordinate member 
of it, have rendered his memory dear to the service, 
and completely effaced the recollection of his failings. 
Very many are the anecdotes related of the unpre- 


Duke of fork 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 263 

meditated proofs of his kindness of heart, and ready 
consideration for his inferiors in station; but every 
soldier should know the following one, — and every 
insolent lackey too. The Duke was on the point of 
mounting his horse one day at Oatlands, to take a 
ride, when, observing a poor woman slowly retreating 
from the door, he enquired of the servant who she 
was? The fellow flippantly replied, " Nobody, your 
Royal Highness, but a soldier's wife, a-begging." 
"And, pray, sir," said the Duke indignantly, "what 
is your mistress? " It is needless to add, the poor 
woman was relieved. 

In Brummell's album are several interesting sou- 
venirs of his visits at Oatlands, written by Sheridan 
and Lord Erskine, who very likely gave them to him 
as having also been a guest on the occasions to which 
they refer. They are pleasing instances of the cheer- 
ful and friendly feeling that existed amongst those 
who enjoyed the Duke's hospitality; and it was 
probably after one of these brilliant and agreeable 
parties, that Sheridan wrote the following admirable 
and good-humoured quiz upon Erskine, which, though 
satirical, is much too harmlessly witty to have offended 
the ex- Chancellor. There was no date attached to it, 
but it was evidently written after that nobleman 
resigned the seals, and previously to May 1812, as 
Mr. Perceval, who is mentioned in it, was assassinated 
in the lobby of the House of Commons on the nth 
of that month.

Where Oatlands' lofty bank, in sylvan pride, 

Looks o'er the Thames and the fair prospect wide, 

There is the spot where once two shepherds stood, 

Safe from the river's fast-encroaching flood; 

Fictitious shepherds, true, and eke 'tis truth, 

Swains not exactly in the bloom of youth; 

Yet both had skill to talk, and verse could scan, 

And now in measured rhyme their converse ran; 

While Thomas clear'd his pipe, sly Richard thus began : —

How could'st thou, Thomas, at the festive board, 

Admitted guest of Oatlands' royal lord, 

Decline the challenge which I gave to thee 

To break a lance in sportive poesy? 

Thou know'st, ere now we've tried the gay dispute, 

Unvanquish'd then, how could'st thou now be mute? 

Unstudied verse might royal care beguile, 

And raise on listening beauty's cheek a favouring smile.

Friend Richard, well I saw your treacherous aim, 
You sought to triumph, and bring me to shame; 
To make a boast in royal beauty's eyes 
You dared the contest, and you hoped the prize; 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 265 

By nature dull, by art a rhymer made, 

Verse your profession, poetry your trade. 

I, bred to nobler purposes, disdain 

A puny contest with the scribbling train; 

And though I sometimes condescend to rhyme, 

When humour prompts, and business grants me time, 

I never publish — do you ask the cause? 

I'm quite contented with my own applause. 

RICHARD. 

Nay, Thomas, hold ! for now, by Heaven, you wrong 
The taste of friendship, and thy power of song; 
For who has read a line that bears thy name, 
Which, though withheld by thee from vulgar fame, 
Taste would disown, or genius fail to claim? 

THOMAS. 

Thy praise, dear Richard, is no doubt sincere, 
But justest praise may yet be bought too dear; 
Practised in jingling verse, you know your power, 
I, the chance poet of an idle hour, 
With thee in verse will battle, when George Rose l 
Shall hate employment, and demand repose; 


1 The Right Honourable George Rose, son of the Rev. David Rose, 
of Lethnet, and descended by his father from an ancient family in 
Nairnshire, was born on the 1 7th of June 1744. At the early age of 
four years he was brought to England, where he was educated, and 
rose to distinction entirely through his own exertions. One of the 
first patrons of this leviathan of industry was BnimmeH's father, who 
from his position in the Treasury was of great service to him in for- 
warding his interests. The following is an epitome of his lucrative 
and honorary occupations. In 1767, he took a principal share in the 
publication of the Journals and Records of Parliament, from the 
earliest period : in 1772, he was appointed to the Keepership of 
Records in the ancient Treasury at Westminster : in 1776, he was 
appointed Secretary to the Board of Taxes : in 1 782, he was named 
Secretary to the Treasury under Lord Shelburne, and Pitt; was re-

Nay, Thomas, sure this flattery's unfit, 
Or wish you irony to pass for wit? 


moved on the change of Government in the spring of 1783, and re- 
appointed under Pitt in the December following. In this year he 
also obtained a reversionary grant of the office of Clerk of Parliament. 
In 1784, he was elected M.P. for Launceston, and in 1788 he vacated 
that seat, on succeeding to the above-mentioned office, and was re- 
turned M.P. for Lymington. In 1790, he sat for Christchurch. In 
1801, he resigned his Secretaryship of the Treasury, and in 1804, on 
Mr. Pitt's return to power, was appointed Joint Paymaster-General of 
the Forces, and Vice-President of the Committee of Privy-Council for 
the Affairs of Trade, which he retained till the death of that Minister. 
In 1807, under the Duke of Portland, he was appointed Treasurer of 
the Navy, and re-appointed Vice-President of the Board of Trade. 
He was likewise a Privy-Councillor, Trustee of the British and 
Hunterian Museums, an Elder Brother of the Trinity House, Deputy 
Warden of the New Forest, and one of the Verderers of the same. 
Under these circumstances it is wonderful the Honourable Gentleman 
did not " demand repose." Sir George Rose died at his seat, Cuffnells, 
near Lyndhurst, on the I3th of January 1818, in the seventy-fourth 
year of his age. 

1 John Barnard Trotter, Esq., Private Secretary to C. J. Fox, of 
whose life and career he published a very strange account. This work 
drew forth some strong animadversions from different writers, and 
among the rest, Dr. Moseley, who decidedly contradicted the author 
with respect to the medical treatment of the illustrious statesman. It 
is probably to Mr. Trotter's book that Sheridan alludes, and to the 
proverbial saying, " He lies like the d 1." 

3 A specimen of Sheridan's drollery; for this unfortunate gentleman 
was particularly thin, and slightly formed, and not exactly the person 
who might be expected to throw down his glove to the Champion of 
England.

Your simile forego, — I dared the test, 

Not who was strongest, but whose muse was best; 

To cover your retreat retract your theme, 

Who hears an eagle's voice must hear a scream; 

Quick then, dear Tom, some new allusion bring, 

Till wrens bear thunderbolts, and eagles sing. 


THOMAS. 

By heavens ! I do my lofty spirit wrong, 

To grate this jarring pipe with thee so long : 

Hast thou not known me in my hour of pride, 

When at the bar I led the legal tide? 

Who could more surely, by each trick and fudge, 

Humbug the jury, or browbeat the judge? 

How many patriots l has my fluent tongue 

Lifted to glory, who had else been hung ! 

While, advocating freedom's sacred cause, 

I won the mob, and gain'd each jail's applause — 

Proving the right of treason to upset the laws. 


RICHARD. 

Nay, not so warm, my dearest Thomas, pray, 
I grant your merit, and grant all you say; 
Thou hast indeed saved many of the gang, 
Who in return would gladly see thee hang. 


THOMAS. 

Richard, I scorn thy taunts and wiliest sneers; 
The merit's mine, the ingratitude is theirs. 
But, grant my labours no due thanks obtain'd, 
Can you forget the higher post I gain'd? 
Must I remind you of the seal I bore,

The flowing train behind, and broider'd purse before? 

Now, by these glorious honours, which again 

I surely shall possess — (though God knows when), 

In verse with thee I never will contend, 

Unless I choose the theme

Agreed, my friend.

Then will I sing to our great Master's praise.

CHAPTER XX. 

A Dinner Party at Oatlands—Lord Erskine's description of it in Verse 
— The Company present — Colonel ] Armstrong — The Honourable 
William Spencer — Monk Lews — Kangaroo Cooke—Lady Anne 
Culling Smith — Miss Fitzroy — Colonel de Lancey Barclay — 
Brumnull — Le Chevalier Cainea — Lord Erskine's Childhood — One 
of his Letters written from School — Goes to Sea in the " Tartar" — 
Letter to Lord Cardcross from Jamaica. 

THIS challenge of Sheridan's seems to have had its 
effect upon Lord Erskine on the 3ist of December 
1812, on which day, in compliance with the good old 
custom of seeing the Old year out and the New year 
in, a dinner party was given at Oatlands; and this he 
afterwards described in the following lively and agree- 
able manner. 

LORD ERSKINE. 

"The fair Princess1 sat first, far the highest in place, 
But her rank in eclipse by good-nature and grace — 
Her manners no court upon earth could bestow, 
To the best of all hearts their perfection they owe; 


1 Her Royal Highness Frederica Charlotte Ulrica Catharina, Prin- 
cess Royal of Prussia, married to the Duke of York, on the 29th of 
September 1791, and died at Oatlands,{on the 6th of August 1820, 
in the fifty-fourth year of her age. 


270 THE LIFE OF 

And her converse, so pleasant, so keen, so refined, 

No reading could give — its bright source is the mind; 

Her elegant form gives a life to the whole; 

Coalition complete of the body and soul. 

Next, Armstrong1 was seated; on Armstrong depend, 

For wit as companion, for truth as a friend; 

As a man of the world he's completely at ease, 

No effort he makes to amuse or to please; 

Yet is sure to do both, with his manners so quiet, 

Sliding in better things than many who try it. 

To Armstrong next sat, my friend William Spencer; * 

Why Spencers such poets are, I would fain ken, sir; 

I hate all monopolies — never was seen 

Such a fuss as we had, with the famed ' Faerie Queen.' 

Ere England had numbers, this bard took the lead, 

And wrote like an angel when few men could read. 

Thus centuries pass'd; and now when Old Time 

Has exalted our language, and fashion'd our rhyme, 

William Spencer runs in, other poets before, 

To witch us as Edmund has witch'd us of yore; 

And yet not content with this talent divine, 

Whenever he speaks^ he must sparkle and shine. 


1 Lieut. Colonel James Armstrong, originally in the Tenth Foot, 
and subsequently in the Ceylon and 5Oth Regiments, was at this 
time an aide-de-camp of the Duke of York's. He died on the I5th of 
August 1828. 

* "Polished William Spencer, the Poet of society," as he was 
usually called, was the second son of Lord Charles Spencer, by the 
Honourable Mary Beauclerk, daughter of Lord Vere, and sister of 
Aubrey, fifth Duke of St. Albans. The first of Mr. Spencer's Poetical 
Works, and published in 1 790, was a translation of Burger's Leonora, 
embellished by his aunt Lady Diana, the wife of Topham Beauclerk, 
a great macaroni in his day. Subsequently to this, he wrote a Drama 
called Urania, or the Illumine; it was performed at Drury Lane, with 
some applause, and his friend Lord John Townshend wrote the 
prologue. In 1811, he published a collection of Poems which were 
dedicated to Sarah, Lady Jersey. This accomplished gentleman, one 
of the most agreeable dining-out men of his day, died at Paris, on the 
23rd of October 1834. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 271 

But to make such a picture as friendship would draw, 

You must lend me, dear Spencer, your pen or your jaw — 

Each a capital prize to a man of the law. 

' Other poets,' cried Lewis,1 who sat next beside, 

' Who shoulder us thus, may all evils betide ! ' 


1 Matthew Gregory Lewis, born in London in 1773, was the son of 
a large West Indian proprietor, at one time Under Secretary at War. 
Educated at Westminster, he afterwards travelled on the Continent, 
and remained some time in Germany, where he imbibed that excessive 
love of the marvellous, which he afterwards displayed in his works; 
exhibiting all the fantastic vagaries of his Teutonic models, in addition 
to the wildness, originality, and license of his own ideas. He had 
talent, but it was of an illegitimate and unhealthy description; and 
his novel and nickname, " The Monk," by which he acquired an infamous 
notoriety, and which on account of its licentiousness was very popular 
with a certain class, will be a lasting monument of his depraved taste 
— lasting, because society will never be without readers who delight 
in works of that character; and in this respect he lives for posterity, 
a posterity of demireps and courtesans, inexperiencedj youth and 
debauchees. Mr. Lewis was a senator, as well as a novelist; but 
seldom took part in the business of the house, and never made a figure 
in it. The notoriety that he succeeded in obtaining by his works, a 
superficial skill in poetry, and great conversational powers, his wealth 
and the letters M.P., enabled him to insinuate himself into the society 
of people of rank. He was a constant visitor of the Princess of Wales 
at Kensington House, and, as seen by this poem, an occasional one at 
Oatlands; where he made himself agreeable to Her Royal Highness, 
by writing elegies and epitaphs on the death of her dogs, and possibly 
birthday odes when they were living. In the periodicals of the day, 
and particularly in a satirical poem, published in 1802, Mr. Lewis and 
his works are severely criticised, and the author concludes his censures 
with these two lines : — 

" That the man who to talent makes any pretence 

Should write not at all, or should write common sense." 

In fairness, however, it ought to be mentioned, that his friend Mr. 
Gait says, in the " Diary illustrative of the Times of George the Fourth " 
that he possessed generous and noble feelings, and talents of a very 
high description. Lord Byron, another intimate friend of his, observes, 


272 THE LIFE OF 

But Lewis all earthly approach may defy; 

As a canonised monk he may mount to the sky; 

No, no, we can't spare his original brain, 

Which has led us so often in Fancy's fair train; 

The scenes that surround us so dully the same, 

Who shifts with his genius well merits his fame. 

Next to Lewis there sat, would you wish to know who? 

I will tell you — my worthy good friend Kangaroo; 1 

He who goes by a name by parents not given, 

Depend on't is one highly favour'd by Heaven; 

that he was a "good man, a clever man, but a bore. My only revenge 
or consolation used to be setting him by the ears with some vivacious 
person who hated bores — especially Madame de Staël, or Hobhouse, 
for example. But I liked Lewis, he was the jewel of a man, had he 
been better set; I don't mean personally, but less tiresome, for he wns 
tedious, as well as contradictory, to everything, and everybody. Poor 
fellow ! he died a martyr to his new riches — of a second visit to 
Jamaica. 

' I'd give the lands of Deloraine, 
Dark Musgrave were alive again.' 

That is— 

' I would give many a sugar-cane 
Mat Lewis were alive again ! ' " 

But it is not easy to reconcile these opinions with the spirit of Mr. 
Lewis's works, which deliberately tend to debase the human heart, 
always sufficiently prone to error and infirmity. The most correct 
view of the Monk's character appears to have been taken by Madame 
de Staël, who wittily and piquantly remarked, that he was not only 
" inferieur, mais iris inferieur" — Mr. Lewis died at sea in 1818. 

1 Major-General Henry Frederick Cooke, C.B. and K.C.H., com- 
monly called Kang-Cooke — a portrait of whom, under that sobriquet, 
is to be found in Dighton's caricatures, was at this time a captain and 
lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream, and aide-de-camp to the Duke of 
York. Various rumours have been circulated to account for his name 
having been thus humorously associated with the mammalia of New 
Holland. One is that he let loose a cage full of these animals at 
Pidcock's menagerie; another, that on being asked by his old patron, 
the Duke of York, how he fared in the Peninsula, replied that he 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 273 

The friend whom we love we mould at our pleasure, 

And count on his temper, the best of all treasure; 

Since in spite of the misanthrope's sullen pretence, 

Good-nature is still the companion of sense. 

Thus take the world o'er, you will find very few 

Who have more of sound brains than this same Kangaroo; 

And as for his person, his breeding, and taste, 

They speak for themselves, so I pass on in haste. 

By this Colonel sat one, in gay circles well known, 

Yet, who see him in rounds of amusement alone, 

Know little about him — they see him at ease, 

A high man of fashion, with talents to please; 

But believe me, in London to rise to the top, 

Like Brummell (since London discarded the fop 1), 

You must know all that's known to the highest in place, 

And possess the rare gift to give knowledge a grace. 

But why should the muse, his acquirements to show, 

Fly to commonplace truths which the vulgar well know? 

Since the brighter the emerald the duchess now wears, 

The higher of course is the polish it bears. 

Oh what shall I write? next him sat Lady Anne,2 

How shall I describe her? describe her who can. 

When I think on her face ev'ry thought's at an end; 

And my numbers must flow as their chances may send, — 

Her eye, full of fire, passes through to the heart, 

As Wellington sees through his ranks at a dart; 

But a truce is soon put to this turbulent pother, 

By the chain-shot of wife tied together with mother; 

Each beauty-bred wish she's for ever annulling, 


" could get nothing to eat but kangaroo." General Cooke died on the 
loth of March 1837, at Harefield Park. He was the last surviving 
brother of Lieutenant-General Sir George Cooke, K.C.B. 

1 Probably some passt dandy about town. 

2 This lady was the only daughter of Garrett Wellesley, second 
Lord Mornington, and sister of the late Marquis Wellesley. Her 
ladyship was born on the I3th of March 1768, married first, Henry 
Fitzroy, third son of Charles, Lord Southampton, and subsequently, 
on the gth of August 1799, Culling Charles Smith, Esq.

All lost in her daughters, and Frederick,1 and Culling.* 

Well, I thought myself safe, and that nought could annoy 

One pass'd through this furnace, — but Madame Fitzroy ! 3 

A plague on such king-craft, renew'd the temptation, 

With beauty new hatch'd in the fifth generation. 

Ah Stuarts ! I feel in the depth of my soul, 

The madness that led ye from loyal control; 

The child of your blood, I renounce your command, 

The people's free Brunswicks shall reign in this land; 

Yet still, like a traitor, my fair Caroline, 

Your subject I live, as your right is divine. 

Halt, blundering muse, to the right-about face, 

You have pass'd over Barclay,* go back to his place; 

1 Frederick William Culling Smith, only son of Culling Charles 
Smith, Esq., and Lady Anne, and a godson of the Duke of York. On 
the i8th of January, 1820, he was appointed to an ensigncy in the 
Coldstream Regiment of Guards, and subsequently obtained a troop in 
the Blues, in which corps he remained till 1826, when he received an 
unattached majority, and afterwards joined the Soth Regiment. To 
the deep regret of his family and friends, Major Smith died at Malta, 
on the igth of June 1828, in the twenty-seventh year of his age. 

* Culling Charles Smith, Esq., father of the above, and son of 
Charles Smith, Esq., Governor of Madras, who was a younger brother 
of Culling, the first baronet of that family. 

* Anne Caroline, daughter of Henry Fitzroy, third son of Charles, 
Lord Southampton, and Lady Anne Wellesley, afterwards Lady Anne 
Culling Smith. Henry Fitzroy's father was a great-grandson of Henry 
Fitzroy, first Duke of Grafton, and, through him, descended from the 
unfortunate House of Stuart — his Grace having been the illegitimate 
child of Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, by Charles the Second. 
The cleverness with which Lord Erskine maintains his political princi- 
ples, and at the same time indulges his gallantry, is very amusing. 
Miss Fitzroy died on the i6th of December 1835. 

4 De Lancey Barclay, C.B., another aide-de-camp of the Duke of 
York's, and one of the most popular men in the army. He was at this 
time in the Royal Corsican Rangers, and died very suddenly of a cold, 
caught by travelling too lightly clad on the top of a coach. Colonel 
Barclay was in the Guards at Waterloo; and, at the period of his death, 
which took place on the 28th of March 1826, he was one of the aides- 
de-camp to George the Fourth. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 275 

You sure must have seen him, so handsome, so tall, 

A straighter has never sprung up since the Fall; 

Better fashion'd without, nor freer within 

From malignant ill-nature's original sin. 

Him famed in our armies one day we shall see, 

Though a Barclay, a Quaker he never will be. 

What sounds melt on air? sure I'm raised to the skies ! 

What harmony swells on the senses and dies? 

Then rises again and pulls at the heart 

With strong chords of Nature, made stronger by art. 

Can this be a dream? No, La Cainea l appears; 

The music I thought must be his, or the spheres'. 

What again? have the fairies encircled me round, 

And carried me off to their spell-bedew'd ground? 

Do I hear Catalani, or is it a thrush, 

In spite of the winter, that sings from his bush? 

No; those beautiful sounds so novel, so true, 

Discover their author; yes, Mercer,2 'tis you : 

Yet think not their notes which yet dwell on the ear, 

Are all we enjoy when their sources are here. 

No — they heighten their value in these social hours 

By taking their parts in the mind's higher powers : 

Miss Muse, you seem tired, but remuster your pith, 

For, next, sat the man of my heart, Culling Smith. 

His friendship I've tried, and for ever have found 

His soul as sincere as his judgment is sound; 

To look at him now, so sprightly, so gay, 

As airy and light as a bird on the spray, 


1 Le Chevalier Cainea, a celebrated amateur Italian singer, who 
resided in England for several years at the commencement of the present 
century. He was a frequent guest of the first [families in the country, 
as well as at the Duke of York's. His voice was a beautiful tenor, and 
his style of chamber-singing replete with taste and feeling. 

* A gentleman who moved in this circle of society, also an excellent 
singer.

You would think him but made for the joys of the table, 

And that all we have heard of grave parts was a fable — 

But let Downing Street tell, which has seen him so late, 

Alas ! snatch'd away by a too-fickle fate, 

How he showed himself form'd for the business of state; 

Quick, active, intelligent, full of resource, 

In manner all mildness, in matter all force.1 

Tom Erskine sat last— sailor, soldier, and lawyer, 

A cross, beyond doubt, between the de'il and old Sawyer; 2 

He tried all the tricks of the old common law, 

Till to Chancery sent, which can cure every flaw : 

So merrily, merrily, let him live now, 

With the planters of trees and the holders of plough." 

By two autograph letters of Lord Erskine's now in 
my possession, the first of which was written when 
he was only twelve years of age, it appears that he 
was at school at St. Andrews; and as trifling circum- 
stances connected with the childhood of such a distin- 
guished man cannot fail to interest the reader, I have 
given the letters a place here. Their introduction 
is the less abrupt, as they will in some measure 
illustrate the allusion made to his own life in the 
words " sailor, soldier, and lawyer; " for a paragraph 
in the first seems to account for the early predi- 

1 The allusion which Lord Erskine here makes to the part Mr. 
Culling Smith took in public life, refers to the period when he was 
Under Secretary of State to his brother-in-law, the late Marquis 
Wellesley, at the time Minister of Foreign Affairs. 

1 Sir Robert Sawyer was Attorney-General in the reign of Charles 
the Second. When the attack was made on the Charter of the City 
of London, ballads were sung about the streets comparing him to the

Pembroke, and by him had issue Henry, the ninth Earl. She died 
in 1706.

probably acquired in his visits to the captains of the 
Norway galliots that he speaks of, or in his walks 
about the quays of the good city of St. Andrews. 

ST. ANDREWS, August n, 1762. 

" MY DEAR BROTHER,1 — I received your letter, and 
it gave me great joy to hear that you were in health, 
which I hope will always continue. I saw in the 
papers that you have got a new cousin, by your 
commander, Major Seton,2 marrying Miss Murray, of 
Abercarney. I am in my second month at the 
dancing-school; I have learned Shantrews and the 
single hornpipe, and I am just now learning the 
double hornpipe. Our school has the vacation just 
now : we got them on the 4th day of August, and 
all the boys that live in the country have gone home.

Lieutenant in the Thirty-second Regiment, which he joined as Ensign 
on the 2nd of August 1761. He retired from the army in 1763, and 
died in 1829. "Lord Buchan's political career," says Sir Egerton 
Brydges, "commenced under the patronage of the great Earl of 
Chatham, in the diplomatic department; but he passed the larger 
portion of his life in literary retirement, cultivating the muses, and 
occasionally laying before the public the fruits of his acquirements."

" Yesterday I saw Captain Sutherland, a nephew of 
Lord Duffus l his lady, who has a lieutenant's com-

Douglas between ten and eleven. Papa made me a 
present of a ring-dial, which I'm very fond of, for it 
tells me what o'clock it is very exactly. You bid me, 
in your letter, write you when I had nothing better 
to do; but I assure you I think I cannot employ 
myself better than to write to you, which I shall 
take care to do very often.

In this letter, which is a correct copy of the 
original, a martial spirit is also observable, and the 
future sailor and soldier alike peep forth : the note

Kenneth, third Baron Duffus, a distinguished naval officer, who was 
attainted after the rebellion in 1715. Eric died in 1768, having failed 
to reverse his father's attainder. He married his cousin, Elizabeth, 
daughter of Sir James Dunbar, of Hempriggs. The title was restored 
in 1826.

is written very neatly with lines, and in a plain 
schoolboy's hand, and considering the age of the 
embryo Chancellor of England, the mistakes of ortho- 
graphy and grammar are not to be complained of; 
there was, however, very little or no punctuation, a 
point on which Mr. Douglas, probably, did not care 
to weary his spirited and clever pupil. Two years 
after this capital specimen of his epistolary powers 
was written, young Erskine went to sea in the 
Tartar, with Commodore Sir John Lindsay,1 which 
was ordered in the first instance to Pensacola, in the 
Gulf of Mexico, and subsequently to Jamaica, from 
whence the following letter was despatched to his 
brother : — 

" KINGSTON IN JAMAICA, July 1764." 
" MY DEAREST CARDROSS, — I wrote to you about 
ten days ago, giving you some small account of what 
I had seen here. I am still with Dr. Butt, but

Jamaica, by his Excellency Governor Lyttleton,2 
whom I waited upon at Spanish Town, along with 
the doctor, some days ago. He is a very affable

in July 1776, by the title of Baron Westcote, and afterwards to that of 
England by that of Lord Lyttleton, which title had expired with his 
nephew and predecessor. His Lordship was Governor of South 
Carolina in 1755, °f Jamaica in 1760, and Envoy Extraordinary and 
Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Portugal, in 1776. Lord 
Lyttleton died in September 1808.

and agreeable man, as I ever saw, and one of great 
learning. The longer I stay in the West Indies, I 
find the country more healthful, and the climate more 
agreeable; I could not help smiling when Mama 
mentioned in her letter, how much reason you had 
to be thankful, that you gave up your commission, 
or you would have gone to the most wretched climate 
on the earth. I don't know indeed, as to the rest 
of the West Indian Islands, but sure I am, if you had 
come here you would have no reason to repent it. 
To be sure, to stay here too long, might weaken 
a constitution, though hardly that; but to stay here 
some time is extremely serviceable. As for me, I 
have great reasons to like the West Indies; I have 
never had an hour's sickness in them, never enjoyed 
better spirits, and found in them so good a friend as 
ever I desired to meet with, as I mentioned in my 
last letter. She supplies the place of mother when 
at a distance from all my relations, and behaves to 
me in every respect better than many relatives, whom, 
from their kindred to my parents, ought to do; that 
is a great advantage, especially when one is in a 
foreign country. 

" I suppose you will by this time be thinking of 
going abroad, as it draws near the time you intended 
going : I suppose you will go first to Italy. Remem- 
ber to write to me from these places; you will have 
many opportunities when you are in Portugal, or 
Spain, as they have great trade with the West Indies; 
so that I expect you won't forget the poor Pots, for I

" I begin now to draw indifferently : I am studying

drawings of all the curious plants, &c., &c., and every- 
thing that I see. 1 have sent Mama home a land 
turtle, to walk about Walcot garden; it is very pretty, 
particularly its back, which is all divided into square 
lozenges, and the shell is as hard as a coat of mail. 
If you have got anything that you wish to send me, 
you need only direct it to Dr. Butt in the same manner 
you direct letters, and put it into a merchantman 
bound for the West Indies, and it can't fail coming 
safe. Doctor Butt desires his best compliments to 
you, and will be obliged to you, if you will send him 
out such a profile of you as you copied from Mr. 
Hoar's. Pray give my compliments to all, and know 
and believe me to be, my dear Cardross, 

" Your affectionate brother, 

"THOMAS ERSKINE." 

Both these letters evince an affectionate, studious, 
and active disposition, and, from the young sailor's 
having been made an acting-lieutenant by Sir John 
Lindsay, it is only reasonable to suppose that he did not 
abandon his profession on account of either inefficiency 
or insubordination : this decided step was, however, 
taken by Erskine soon after Sir John was relieved by 
Commodore Johnson, and the cause which led to it was 
said to be the harsh conduct of his new commander.

CHAPTER XXL 

LordErskine Enters the Army — His Slow Promotion — Leaves the Service 
— Enters at Cambridge — His great Admiration and Friendship 
for Fox — Lines written by him at Oatlands on receiving from the 
Duchess of York a Lock of that Statesman's Hair — Lord Byron — 
Two Fragments of his Unpublished Poetry — Stanzas on the Murder 
of Mr. Weir, by the Rev. /. Mitford—The Younger Brother's Claim 
— Les Mille Colonnes — Epigrams. 

AFTER his return home, young Erskine tried the sister 
service, and on the 1st of September 1768 obtained 
an Ensign's commission in the second battalion of the 
First, or Royal Regiment of Foot, most of the officers 
of which corps, as well as the Colonel, John Duke of 
Argyle, were his countrymen. In this regiment he 
remained seven years, having been promoted in 1770, 
at the early age of twenty, to the rank of Benedict, 
and to a lieutenancy on the 2ist of April 1773. 

It was possibly this slow promotion which induced 
Lieutenant Erskine to quit the army two years after, 
added to the encomiums that his talents elicited from 
clever and intellectual men; which possibly encouraged 
the idea, that he might distinguish himself in an arena 
more suited to his genius. Dr. Johnson, when on his 
tour in Scotland, and at the time sixty-three years of 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 283 

age, dined at Sir Alexander Macdonald's, where, as 
Boswell says, " was a young officer in the regimentals 
of the Scots Royals, who talked with a vivacity, 
fluency, and precision so uncommon, that he attracted 
particular attention; he proved to be the Honourable 
T. Erskine, youngest brother to the Earl of Buchan, 
who has risen into such brilliant reputation at the bar 
of Westminster Hall. Erskine told us," says Boswell, 
" that when he was in the island of Minorca, he not 
only read prayers, but preached two sermons to the 
regiment; " on which Mr. Croker observes, " Lord 
Erskine was fond of this anecdpte; he told it to me 
the first time that I had the honour of being in his 
company, and often repeated it, with an observation 
that he had been a sailor and a soldier, was a lawyer 
and a parson; the latter . he affected to think the 
greatest of his efforts, and to support that opinion 
would quote the prayer for the clergy in the Liturgy, 
from the expression of which he would (in no com- 
mendable spirit of jocularity) infer, that the enlighten- 
ing them was one of the greatest marvels ' which 
could be worked.' " 

This anecdote completes the illustration of the line, 

" Tom Erskine sat last — sailor, soldier, and lawyer," 

with the addition of another profession; and as Lord 
Erskine, in his letter to his brother, says that he 
" studied botany with Dr. Butt, the Physician- 
General," it is not impossible that he practised under 
him, and took a degree. This would establish his 


284 THE LIFE OF 

credit to a very extraordinary claim — that of having 
belonged to all the " liberal professions," and would 
account very satisfactorily for his having so heartily 
espoused the Whig cause. 

After retiring from the army, Mr. Erskine went to 
Cambridge, and was called to the bar in 1778; in 
1783 he was made King's Counsel, and in 1806 
appointed Lord-Chancellor. The change of his uni- 
form for a silk gown did not, however, annihilate his 
military feelings, for during the war he was Colonel 
of the Law Association Volunteers; and it was while 
in command of this distinguished corps, at a review 
in Hyde Park, that he gave one of the many amusing 
proofs of his talent for repartee. It was the King's 
birthday, and the royal cavalcade having passed down 
the line, the Duke of Cambridge fell back and spoke 
to Erskine, saying, " How well your corps behaves ! 
are they all lawyers? " " Yes, sir," he replied; 
" and some of them very good lawyers too." " And 
good soldiers," said the Duke; " for how silent they 
are ! " " Yes," said Erskine; " but does your Royal 
Highness recollect that we have no pay? " 

Lord Erskine had not lost his military spirit at the 
age of sixty-five, for, in one of his letters, written 
from the Continent in July 1815, he observes, "As 
soon as I return you shall have an account of my 
tour with the army in France, and going with it to 
Paris : we shall have peace at last." " Neither Lord 
Erskine's conversation," writes Mr. Croker, " (though, 
even to the last, remarkable for fluency and vivacity) 


Lord Erskine 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 285 

nor his parliamentary speeches, ever bore any pro- 
portion to the extraordinary force of his forensic 
eloquence. Those who only knew him in private, or 
in the House of Commons, had some difficulty in 
believing the effect he produced at the bar. During 
the last few years of his life his conduct was eccentric, 
and justified a suspicion, and even a hope, that his 
understanding was impaired." Eccentric he certainly 
was towards the close of his life. A friend of mine 
met him one afternoon walking in the Park, accom- 
panied by his little dog (that, with reverential feeling, 
he had christened after the great orator of his party), 
and asked him what had been going on in the House 
of Lords the night before? when he replied, " Oh, it 
was all G — d d — n butter and Ireland. Fox, Fox," 
he continued, as he walked on, whistling to his four- 
footed representative of Charles James, " Fox, Fox," 
&c. Lord Erskine's attachment to the memory of his 
friend was very great, and the following lines, also in 
the Beau's collection, were written by him, at Oat- 
lands, on receiving a lock of his hair from Her Royal 
Highness the Duchess of York : — 

" Could reliques, as at Rome they show, 
Work miracles on earth below, 
This hallow'd little lock of hair 
Might soothe the patriot's anxious care; 
Might, to St. Stephen's chapel brought, 
Inspire each noble, virtuous thought 
With which its echoing benches rung, 
Whilst thunders roll'd o'er Fox's tongue; — 
Alas ! alas ! the vision's vain ! 
From the dark grave none come again. 


286 THE LIFE OF 

That spirits wait on human weal 
Is but the dream of holy zeal; 
Yet, not for that less dear should be 
Whate'er may lift my mind to thee;— 
And this shall tell beyond the grave, 
The head that bore, the hand that gave ! " 

It is singular, considering the number of witty but 
briefless barristers, which either an increase in the 
population and therefore in their own numbers, or a 
disinclination to employ them, has left in the enjoy- 
ment of learned leisure, that not one of them should 
have amused himself and others with the biography 
of their great model, and collected the jeux (f esprit, 
impromptus, and other memorials of his humour and 
talent, with which he used to " humbug the jury, and 
browbeat the judge." The description of the dinner- 
party at the Duke of York's is an interesting specimen 
of the light and lively spirit which, at sixty-two years 
of age, animated this great advocate's leisure hours, 
after his retirement from public life. His egotism, 
which has so often been complained of by his con- 
temporaries, and which has been alluded to by 
Sheridan in " The Eagle and the Wren," 

" I'm quite contented with my own applause," 

is certainly not perceptible in that poem. Lord 
Erskine seems to have been amiably occupied in 
selecting topics for praise in others, instead of extort- 
ing their admiration for himself, which he is repre- 
sented by Lord Byron to have done, to a most un- 
pleasant degree, in the summer of the very same 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 287 

year. They were dining together at Middleton, Lord 
Jersey's, and, in Byron's words, "amongst a goodly 
company of lords, ladies, and wits, &c., there was 
. . . ., Erskine too ! Erskine was there, good, but 
intolerable. He jested, he talked, he did everything 
admirably, but then he would be applauded for the 
same thing twice over; he would read his own 
verses, his own paragraph, and tell his own story 
again and again, and then the ' Trial by Jury/ I 
almost wished it abolished — for I sat next to him at 
dinner. As I had read his published speeches, there 
was no occasion to repeat them to me." Lord Byron, 
who was only twenty-five years of age when he made 
this flippant remark, appears to have dwelt frequently 
and severely upon this point of Lord Erskine's char- 
acter, for he says — " March 6th, 1814. On that day 
I dined with Rogers : Sheridan told a very good story 
of himself and Mademoiselle Recamier's handkerchief : 
— Erskine, a few stories of himself." If Lord Erskine 
was vain, which appears to be universally admitted, 
he had at least good grounds for being so; though 
not on account of his poetry — very nearly all that 
Lord Byron had to be proud of; and this he was, as 
Lucifer himself : had he lived to Counsellor Ego's age, 
he might possibly have talked over Childe Harold 
and The Corsair till his hearers were sick of listening 
to him. In his youth the noble Poet was certainly 
not deficient in anxiety for praise, as his actions, 
and talented lampoon upon better men than himself, 
though not such clever poets, fully attest. Brummell 


288 THE LIFE OF 

was very intimate with Lord Byron : he not only 
speaks of him in the letter which accompanied his 
album, when he presented it to his young friend, but 
also in another, given towards the close of this 
memoir. In that, he alluded to a correspondence that 
existed between them " in our familiar days; " and as 
the two following pieces of his Lordship's poetry, 
taken from the album, are not printed in the latest 
edition of his works, I venture to hope that they have 
never been published. 

TO ONE WHO PROMISED ON A LOCK OF HAIR. 

LORD BYRON. 

" Vow not at all, but if thou must, 
Oh ! be it by some slender token : 
Since pious pledge, and plighted trust, 
And holiest ties, too oft are broken. 
Then by this dearest trifle swear, 
And if thou lov'st as I would have thee, 
This votive ringlet's tenderest hair 
Will bind thy heart to that I gave thee." 

TO . 

LORD BYRON. 

" Go — ! triumph securely — the treacherous vow 
Thou hast broken, I keep but too painfully now; 
But never again shall thou be to my heart 
What thou wert — what I fear for a moment thou art : 
To see thee — to love thee — what heart could do more? 
To love thee — to lose thee, 'twere vain to deplore ! 
Ashamed of my weakness, however beguiled, 
I shall bear like a man what I feel like a child. 
If a frown cloud my brow, yet it lours not on thee; 
If my heart should seem heavy, at least it is free : 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 289 

But thou, in the pride of new conquest elate, 

Alas ! even envy shall feel for thy fate. — 

For the first step of error none e'er could recall, 

And the woman once fallen for ever must fall; 

Pursue to the last the career she begun, 

And be false unto many, as faithless to one; 

And they who have loved thee will leave thee to mourn, 

And they who have hated will laugh thee to scorn; 

And he who adored thee — must weep to foretell 

The pangs which will punish thy falsehood too well." 

The following stanzas, certainly possessing as 
much originality as any that have yet been given, 
were the last that Brummell inscribed in his common- 
place book. They must have struck his fancy much, 
for it was evident, by the carelessness of the writing 
compared with every other piece in the book, that he 
had long ceased to make any additions to it. In them 
the author apostrophises the bird of night, on the 
subject of Weir's murder, by the cold-blooded villain 
Thurtell, in Gill's Hill Lane, near Elstree, Herts, on 
the evening of the 24th of October 1824. The 
principal features of this notorious crime are dexter- 
ously introduced, and the reader may fancy the 
feathered witness of it, one of the owls in Der Frei- 
schutz, who, with dilated eye and waving wings, 
relates the dark horrors he beheld.

to St. Alban's, and in the chancel of the church are 
also the remains of Miss Reay, the unfortunate mistress 
of Lord Sandwich, the circumstances of whose violent 
death have already been mentioned. The talented 
author of these lines gave me permission to insert 
them here, and to that gentleman, Mr. Leigh Hunt,

and the Rev. A. Dyce, I am indebted for much kind 
and valuable assistance, in my endeavours to ascertain 
what portions of the poetry in Brummell's album had 
already been published. This has, I trust, together 
with my own researches, protected me from the error 
of publishing, as a novelty, what has been printed 
before, — a remark which I hope will also apply cor- 
rectly to the remaining little pieces and epigrams : 
they were entered anonymously, and with the excep- 
tion of the epigrams, may or may not be, what he 
designates in his note, as some of his own " namby-

written at Calais or Caen.

some wife, Madame Remain, surnamed la belle limonaditre, who sat 
behind the counter on a throne, which had formerly belonged to Eugene 
Beauharnais, when viceroy of Italy. The "towering curls" refer to 
her peculiar headdress; her portrait can be seen in the tenth chapter 
of V. Fournel's Les Rues du Vieux Paris, Paris, 1879. Madame 
Remain, a few years after the death of her very plain-looking and one- 
armed husband, retired to a convent, where she died.

AT the commencement of Brummell's career, he was 
generally with the Prince or his great friends, and but 
seldom at the clubs; so seldom, indeed, that one of 
his chums in the Tenth told me that he rarely met 
him at them. He did not at this period require strong 
excitements, like his friends Sheridan and Fox, and 
men of similar dispositions; to them the clubs were 
like night taverns, to which they retired for amuse- 
ment, after undergoing the terrible sufferings of poli- 
ticians wisely condemned by the country to legislate 
for it till midnight. Deep potations, blade-bones of 
mutton, and the music of the dice-box he had, at this 
time, the good sense to eschew : 'tis true he dropped 
in occasionally upon their orgies, pour se devaliser 
t 'esprit, and to enjoy the jokes of others, but not to

steep his own intellects in wine. After his quarrel 
with the Prince, he was a great deal more at the clubs, 
particularly Watier's,[1] which was at the corner of 
Bolton Street, and extremely select; this club was 
established by a person of that name, with a com- 
mittee of gentlemen, Brummell being one of its 
principal supporters. It is thus alluded to by Lord 
Byron, who calls it the " Dandy Club," and he speaks 
of Lord Alvanley, Brummell, Mildmay, and Pierre- 
point, as the four chiefs. 

"I liked the Dandies," says the noble Poet; "they were all very civil to me, although in general they  disliked literary people, and persecuted and mystified Madame de Staël, Lewis, Horace Twiss, and the like, most damnably. They persuaded Madame de 

---
1 Brummell was also a member of Brookes's; he was proposed by 
Mr. Fawkener, on the 2nd of April 1799, and declined, as it is delicately 
expressed in the ledger of the club, in May 1816. In the July number 
of the Edinburgh Review 1844 appeared an article on John Heneage 
Jesse's "George Selwyn and his Contemporaries," in which it is stated 
that, " Watier's Club in Piccadilly was the resort of the Macao players. 
It was kept by an old mattre d'hStel of George the Fourth, a character 
in his way, who took a just pride in the cookery and wines of the 
establishment. All the brilliant stars of fashion (and fashion was power 
then) frequented it, with Biummell for their sun. Poor Brummell dead, 
in misery and idiocy at Caen ! and I remember him in all his glory, 
cutting his jokes after the Opera at White's in a black velvet great- 
coat and a cocked hat on his well-powdered hair. Nearly the same 
turn of reflection is suggested, on gaming, as we run over the names of 
his associates. Almost all of these were ruined, three out of four 
irretrievably. Indeed it was the forced expatriation of its supporters 
that caused Watier's to be broken up. During the same period, from 
1810 to 1813 or thereabouts, there was a great deal of high play at 
White's and Brookes's, particularly whist. At Brookes's figured some 
remarkable characters, such as Tippoo Smith, Colonel Aubrey, and a 
nobleman who was called "le Wellington des joueurs."

that A had a hundred thousand a year, &c., &c., 

till she praised him to his face for his beauty, and made 
a set at him for — , and a hundred fooleries besides. 
The truth is, that though I gave up the business earl}', 
I had a tinge of Dandyism in my minority, and pro- 
bably retained enough of it to conciliate the great ones, 
at five-and-twenty. I had gamed and drunk, and taken 
my degrees in most dissipations, and having no pedan- 
try, and not being overbearing, we ran on quietly to- 
gether. I knew them all, more or less, and they made 
me a member of Watier's (a superb club at that time), 
being, as I take it, the only literary man, except two 
others (both men of the world), Moore and Spencer, in it. Our masquerade was a grand one, so was the Dandy ball too." 

This memorable fete was given at the Argyle 
Rooms in July 1813, by the four gentlemen already 
mentioned, after winning a very considerable sum one 
evening at hazard. Elated with their run of good 
luck, they very gallantly determined to give a fancy 
ball, one that would astonish their friends : a serious 
question, however, arose among them, whether they 
should or should not invite the Prince, who had 
previously quarrelled with Brummell and Sir Henry 
Mildmay; but after a long, loyal, and solemn discus- 
sion on this most important subject, Brummell very 
properly laid aside his own feelings, and it was agreed 
that Mr. Pierrepoint should sound the Regent, and 
ascertain if he would like to accept the invitation. 
The Prince immediately intimated, and with some 


298 THE LIFE OF 

eagerness, his desire to be invited, and he accordingly 
was so, in the names of all the four votaries of Terpsi- 
chore; and on the night in question my informant 
went early, with a few others, in order that they 
might get well placed, for the purpose of witnessing 
the manner in which His Royal Highness would 
notice Brummell and Sir Henry. 

When the Prince arrived he made one of his stately 
bows to Lord Alvanley and Mr. Pierrepoint, and shook 
each of them cordially by the hand; but of the other 
two gentlemen he took no notice whatever, nor would 
he even appear to know that they were present. The 
consequence was, that when the Regent retired, Brum- 
mell, justly incensed at the insult thus publicly and 
designedly put upon him, would not attend him to his 
carriage : this the Prince did not fail to observe, and 
the next day, when speaking of the circumstance, 
said, " Had Brummell taken the cut I gave him 
good-humouredly, I would have renewed my intimacy 
with him," which, in conformity with the feeling thus 
expressed, he never afterwards did. This anecdote is 
in strong contrast to the general opinion, that the Prince 
was the most finished gentleman of his day. Surely it 
was undignified on his part, to take advantage of his 
rank, and cut his old companion when he was actually 
his guest, and -certain that he could not retaliate.1 

When Brummell first commenced play, he was very 
successful, the case with nine men out of ten, and on 
one occasion he won six-and-twenty thousand pounds 
1 See VoL II., Appendix. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 299 

— pretty high play for a man whose patrimony did 
not much exceed that sum. His friends after this 
lucky hit strongly recommended him to buy an annuity; 
but he either refused to adopt the suggestion, or 
neglected to act with sufficient promptitude upon their 
advice, and a few nights after he lost it all again. 
The following is an example of his success and of his 
impudence, and also the rather unusual circumstance 
of his getting the worst of a joke. The loser was the 
late Alderman Combe, also a great gamester, and who, 
though unsuccessful in this instance, made, it is said, 
as much money by his dexterity at play as he did by 
brewing. One evening while he filled the office of 
Lord Mayor of London, he was busily engaged at a 
full Hazard-table at Brookes's, where the wit and 
the dice-box circulated together with great glee, and 
where Brummell was also one of the party : " Come, 
Mash-tub," said the Beau, who was the castor, " what 
do you set? " " Twenty-five guineas," answered the 
Alderman. " Well, then, have at the Mayor's pony l 
only, and seven's the main," replied Brummell; and 
he continued to throw until he drove home the Brewer's 
twelve ponies running; he then rose from his chair, 
and, making him a low bow whilst pocketing the cash, 
exclaimed; " Thank you, Alderman; in future I shall 
never drink any porter but yours." " I wish, sir," 
said Combe, " that every other blackguard in London 
would tell me the same." 2

300 THE LIFE OF 

11 During the height of his prosperity," says Tom 
Raikes in his Journal, " I remember him coming in 
one night after the Opera to Watier's and finding the 
Macao l table full, one place at which was occupied by 
Tom Sheridan, who was never in the habit of playing, 
but having dined freely, had dropped in to the Club, 
and was trying to catch the smiles of fortune by risk- 
ing a few pounds which he could ill afford to lose. 
Brummell proposed to him to give up his place and 
go shares in his deal; and adding to the ten pounds 
which Tom had in counters before him £200 for him- 
self, took the cards. He dealt with his usual success, 
and in less than ten minutes won ^1500; he 
then stopped, made a fair division, and giving £750 
to Sheridan, said to him : ' There, Tom, go home and 
give your wife and brats a supper, and never play 
again.' I mention the anecdote as characteristic of 
the times, the set, and of a spirit of liberality in 
Brummell." 

The reaction, however, came at last; the stakes 
were too high, and the purses of his companions too 
long, for him to stand against any continued run of 
bad luck; indeed, the play at Watier's, which was very 
deep, eventually ruined the club, as well as Brummell 
and several other members of it; a certain Baronet 
now living is asserted to have lost ten thousand 
pounds there at ecarte, at one sitting : but play ran 
high at all the clubs; " Pay fifteen hundred pounds to 
Lord * * *," said the late Marquis of H one night 

1 Macao was a game of cards, somewhat resembling vingt-et-un.

to the croupier, at White's — it was for one rubber of 
whist. " It should, however, be remarked," added the 
member of this club who mentioned the circumstance 
to me, " the order was more often given by the noble 
Marquis's adversary." The influx of foreigners, in the 
years 1814 and 1815, greatly contributed to increase 
the taste for play at this period, and the celebrity 
gained by Blucher, at the baths of Pyrmont, did not 
desert him in London. Gay and gallant Guardsmen 
too, fresh from their late achievements in the field, 
and tired of " roughing it on a beefsteak and a bottle 
of port," were eagerly bent on indemnifying them- 
selves for the hardships they had undergone; 
Almacks and the Clubs were burning to receive them, 
the women were all crazy to have them in their 
drawing-rooms, and they lost no time in making love, 
as ardently as they had made war; or in losing their 
back pay, that had accumulated by a disease under 
which the army in Spain had frequently and severely 
suffered — an affection of the military chest. Elder 
brothers, who unfortunately did not fight, were imme- 
diately laid under contribution; at least all those who 
were able and willing to honour the heroes and their 
cheques; and these new levies, or a portion of them, 
also found their way to the board of green cloth. The 
season of 1814 saw Brummell a winner, and a loser 
likewise, and this time he lost not only his winnings, 
but "an unfortunate ten thousand pounds," which, when 
relating the circumstance to a friend many years after- 
wards, he said, was all that remained at his banker's. 


### Page 302

One night, the fifth of a most relentless run of ill 
luck, his friend Pemberton Mills heard him exclaim 
that he had lost every shilling, and only wished some 
one would bind him never to play again; — " I will," 
said Mills, and taking out a ten-pound note he offered 
it to Brummell, on condition that he should forfeit a 
thousand, if he played at White's within a month 
from that evening. The Beau took it, and for a few 
days discontinued coming to the club; but about a 
fortnight after, Mills, happening to go in, saw him 
hard at work : of course the thousand pounds were 
forfeited; but his friend, instead of claiming it, merely 
went up to him, and touching him gently on the 
shoulder said, " Well, Brummell, you may at least give 
me back the ten pounds you had the other night." 

He was at last completely beggared, though for some time he continued to hold on by the help of funds raised on the mutual security of himself and his friends, some of whom were not in a much more flourishing condition than himself; their names however, and still more their expectations, lent a charm to their bills, in the eyes of the usurers, and money was procured — of course at ruinous interest. It is said, that some unpleasant circumstances, connected with the division of tone of these loans, occasioned the Beau's expatriation, and that a personal altercation took place between Brummell and a certain Mr. M[eyler], when that gentleman accused him of taking the lion's share. 

The author will not undertake to say to whom, or 


### 303 

to what extent, culpability is to be attached in this affair: Brummell might have hoped that a turn of luck would enable him to retrieve his losses, and repay those of whom he had borrowed; and as to the punctuality attending the payment of play-debts at White's and Brookes's, it does not appear that a want of it was at all unusual, — that is, if we are to judge by the letters of Sheridan, Fitzpatrick, and others. The impossibility, however, of settling this quarrel, is assigned by Lord Byron as the reason which led to Brummell's departure from England. "When Brummell," says his Lordship, "was obliged by that affair of poor M[eyler], who thence acquired the name of Dick the Dandy-killer (it was about money, and debt, and all that), to retire to France," &c., &c. Certain it is thffifr^ was well acquainted with the money-lenders, for several of these parchments emerged from their obscurity during Brummell's sojourn at Calais. Some of these bonds were drawn by Lord C----, the Marquis of ----, and George Bryan Brummell, and, as fragments of them were occasionally sent to one of his friends there, to mix his snuff in, it may be presumed that at least a few of these proofs of mutual love and affection had been redeemed; but there is also every reason for supposing that, in similar transactions, several of his obligations were left unfulfilled: those who were parties to them suffered of course by his departure, and I believe no one more so than Lord R---- M----. 

Among the numerous anecdotes with which he has 

### Page 304 THE LIFE OF 

been charged, is one which applies specially to his indifference on these matters. According to this on dit, Brummell once consented to borrow five hundred pounds of an individual who, from his position in society, had some difficulty in getting introduced into the world of fashion, and who hoped that his assistance in the emergency referred to, would secure him, through the Beau's influence, the much-desired honour: it did so, but not exactly in the manner that he expected, for, when in Brummell's decadence his applications for payment became frequent, and of course annoying, the falling meteor at last replied, that he had already paid him: "Paid me," said Mr. ----. 

"When?" "When?" re-echoed Brummell, with assumed indignation, "why, when I was standing at the window at White's, and said as you passed — Ah, how do you do, Jemmy? " But verily " there is a tide in the affairs of men," particularly in such men, and it was a neap one with him : Fortune, who had been his housekeeper so long, now fairly gave him warning; it was useless calling for fresh cards, the game was up. Yet, great as his extravagance was, it was play that completed his ruin; had he refrained from gaming, he might have lived all his life on the sunny side of St. James's Street! and been buried by the side of his respectable ancestor, in the churchyard of that parish, instead of wearing away a monotonous existence upon the charity of his friends, in pacing the dirty streets of a continental town. 

Brummell had a very odd way of accounting for 

### Page 305 

the sad change which took place in his affairs at this time. "He used," observes one of his friends at Caen, "when talking about his altered circumstances, to say, that up to a particular period of his life everything prospered with him, and that he attributed this good luck to the possession of a certain silver six-pence, with a hole in it, which somebody had given him years before, with an injunction to take good care of it, as everything would go well with him so long as he did, and vice versa, if he happened to lose it.

The promised prosperity attended him for many years, whilst he held the sixpence fast; but having at length, in an evil hour, unfortunately given it by mistake to a hackney-coachman, a complete reverse of his previous good fortune took place, and one disastrous occurrence succeeded to another, till actual ruin overtook him at last, and obliged him to expatriate himself. On my asking him why he did not advertise, and offer a reward for the lost treasure, he said, 'I did, and twenty people came with sixpences having holes in them to obtain the promised reward, but mine was not amongst them.' ' And you never afterwards,' said I, 'ascertained what became of it?' 

' Oh yes ! ' he replied, ' no doubt that rascal Roths- 
child, or some of his set, got hold of it.' If you 
think the foregoing plaisanterie worth inserting, do so; 
I can vouch for its authenticity, as it occurred in con- 
versation with myself. Whatever poor Brummell's 
superstitious tendencies may have generally been, he 

had unquestionably a superstitious veneration for his 

### Page 306

lost sixpence." But to continue : a cloud also had 
for some time been gathering over his fame as well 
as his fortunes; the prestige of his name was going, 
and his fiat no longer regarded; public events had 
eclipsed him, and the ladies of the beau monde were 
far more interested in hero-worship, or in procuring 
a hair from the tail of Platoff s horse, than securing 
the good opinion of the once all-powerful dictator. 
Brummell and Buonaparte, who had hitherto divided 
the attention of the world, fell almost together; the 
former being doomed to the mortification of seeing 
his share bestowed on the sea-fight in the Serpentine, 
the Chinese Pagoda, and Oldenburg hats, and his 
cleanliness forgotten in that of the fierce sons of the 
Don.

AT length the pressing solicitations of the Dandy-killer made London — London, in the height of the season — positively unpleasant to the unfortunate Antonio, who would perhaps have given a pound of flesh, ay, and perhaps more, to have averted the crisis; but his creditor was no Shylock, and ducats there were none, so there was but one alternative left, and on the i6th of May, 1816, he suddenly retired from the stage on which he had played such a conspicuous part. On this eventful Thursday, he dined off a cold fowl and a bottle of claret, which was sent him from Watier's, and it is said that only a few hours before he took wing, he wrote the following laconic note to one of his intimes: — 

" MY DEAR SCROPE, — Lend me two hundred pounds; the banks are shut, and all my money is in the three 

### Page 308

per cents. It shall be repaid to-morrow morning.
Yours, GEORGE BRUMMELL." 

His friend, very probably thinking that he was hard up, immediately sent him this equally laconic reply: 

"MY DEAR GEORGE, — 'Tis very unfortunate; but all 
my money is in the three per cents. — Yours, 

"S. DAVIES."1 

" Scrope Davies," says Lord Byron, " is a wit, and 
a man of the world, and feels as much as such a 
character can do." In this respect the resemblance 
between the two friends was sufficiently strong, and, 
if the anecdote is true, the answer could scarcely have 
occasioned Brummell any surprise. But he was not 
a man to moralise upon it, or soliloquise in front of 
his club or the houses of his friends, those houses in 
which he had been so often a welcome guest; though, 
as he passed them this evening for the last time, the 
future must have pressed itself upon his mind, with a 

1 A clergyman, a friend of mine, told me that he was once roused 
from his slumbers in the dead of the night by a violent knocking at his 
bed-room door, and a shrill female voice, calling out in accents of 
terror, " Sir, sir, Mary's a beginning to cut her throat," another Abigail 
of the establishment. I allude to the circumstance, as an introduction 
to an anecdote told of Scrope Davies, who, when at Cambridge, is said 
to have cut his, after every Newmarket meeting; indeed so frequently 
did he amuse himself in this way, that on one occasion the medical 
man who was sent for refused to hurry when he heard it was Scrope's 
throat That he was required to sew up, saying, "There is no danger of 
him. I have done that six times already." 


BEAU BRUMMELL. '309 

very cheerless and unpromising aspect. On the night 
that he left London, the Beau was seen as usual at 
the Opera, but he left early, and, without returning to 
his lodgings, stepped into a chaise which had been 
procured for him by a noble friend, and met his own 
carriage a short distance from town. Travelling all 
night as fast as four post-horses and liberal donations 
could enable him, the morning of the i/th dawned on 
him at Dover, and immediately on his arrival there, 
he hired a small vessel, put his carriage on board, 
and was landed in a few hours on the other side. 
By this time, the West End had awoke and missed 
him; particularly his tradesmen and his enemies, both 
of whom had long scores against him. 

All sorts of reports were in circulation at the time 
Brummell disappeared. Thus in the " Diary of a Diplo- 
matist" l we find it stated, on May 21, 1816, " The re- 
spectable fraternity of legs in high life are thrown into 
a state of extreme consternation by the disappearance 
of Beau Brummell, a friend of the Prince Regent, with 
£40,000, the whole of which he is said to have fraudu- 
lently obtained. He absconded on Saturday last." And 
on May 24, two o'clock P.M. : " Beau Brummell's defi- 
ciencies amount to a still greater- sum than I men- 
tioned G told me an hour ago that he borrowed 

the money in the way of acceptances from the Duke of 
Rutland, Lords Charles and John Manners, &c. The 
Marquis of Worcester stood the flat for £7000.

has even bilked; Long Wellesley says he is in 

Picardy." 

In much less haste, and happily with a very 
different object in view, I took my departure for 
France in the spring of 1842. Calais lay in my route, 
and, in the few days I remained there, I collected the 
little that was remembered of the Beau's history dur- 
ing his long residence in that sanctuary of English 
debtors. The absurd privileges of by-gone times, 
which were so long left untouched by corrupt Govern- 
ments, are now falling rapidly before the power of 
public opinion; and perhaps no greater proof of the 
desire to promote the interests of honest men has been 
given in the treaties with foreign powers of late years, 
than that clause which has opened the shores of 
America to the righteous claims of justice. To her 
demands " la Grande Nation " is still deaf, but though 
it may be an Utopian idea to suppose that any par- 
ticular creed of the Christian religion will ever be 
universal, we may at least hope that this, the greatest 
of its attributes, will at some period be recognised by 
all mankind : with us the principle of leaving the 
course of justice free has long been recognised, and 
the last remnant of a contrary character was de- 
stroyed, when the privileges of the Isle of Man were 
abrogated. While the rogue has been thus defeated 
in his plans of emigration, greater facilities for 
arranging his difficulties, and a greater share of 
personal liberty, have been afforded to the honest 
debtor: for the protection of such men, no country 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 311 

can show a more humane code of laws than Eng- 
land.1 

If there was any one on board the Belfast abscond- 
ing from them, or his creditors, the slow rate at which 
we made our way down the river, against the still 
flowing tide, must have given him some qualms, even 
while we were in smooth water, for a silver oar might 
easily have overtaken us before we reached Grave- 
send. Old Father Thames is always a stirring sight 
to an Englishman, but the Pool was nearly clear of 
shipping, owing to the lengthened set-in of westerly 
winds : and not even a barge was run down, or a 
wherry swamped, to enliven the tedium of looking at 
the sedgy banks of the Essex shore. Tired of nature, 
I turned to my steaming companions; but with 
them, alas ! all was unprofitable as on terra firma : 
they were as taciturn as Englishmen, when strangers, 
and dependent entirely on each other for amusement, 
usually are; and the only sociable creature on board 
was Boatswain, the captain's Newfoundland dog, 
whose good opinion I soon secured with a biscuit : it 
would have been difficult to say how long it would 
have taken me to secure that of my companions. It 
was night when we reached our destination, but there 
was still light enough to see that the "juste milieu" 
authorities had grubbed up the plate on the pier that 
marked the spot on which Louis the Eighteenth 
" Set the first of his own dear legitimate feet " — 

1 On the 1 3th of February of the year 1843, a Convention was 
signed between England and France, for the mutual surrender in 
certain cases of persons fugitive from justice.

his left foot : unfortunate omen ! when he returned 
from his exile. Everything else wore the same aspect 
here as on a previous visit, when, to prevent me from 
introducing the cholera, I was obliged to submit to a 
quarantine of three days, in company with a Spanish 
courier, as highly seasoned with garlic as any olla 
podrida that he had ever eaten. A villanous place 
near Fort Rouge was the one appointed for our puri- 
fication; whether that happy consummation was ever 
obtained by my companion in this world, I will not 
undertake to say positively — in purgatory it might 
have been just possible. The morning after my 
arrival I took a stroll on the ramparts, and found 
Hogarth's Gate looking not a day older; the fish- 
women and their skate not a whit more handsome; 
they — the women, not the skate — still wearing huge 
gold earrings, and blue-and-red worsted stockings 
and petticoats. The habits of the people, at any rate 
those of the lower orders, appeared to have remained 
as unchanged as their costume; and it still happens 
that a Frenchman may be seen to bite his friend's 
nose off on the Grande Place, in the squabbles that 
take place on a market-day, or beat his head in with 
his sabot after he has got him down. 

Boxing may be termed a noble science, though the 
exhibitions in the prize-ring of late years have led 
many to think it otherwise; as the lion does not yet 
lie down with the lamb, nor is likely to do so for 
some time to come, the utility of " the noble art of 
self-defence" must be acknowledged — in so far as it 
restrains all unfair and savage propensities, when 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 313 

men will not settle a quarrel without proceeding to 
blows. What will its enemies say to the execrable 
American practice of gouging? or the disgusting 
mode of fighting, indulged in by our neighbours, 
called the " savatte "? It was, probably, a detesta- 
tion of these, or other brutalities, and a conviction 
of the necessity of maintaining in the more humble 
classes what is natural to every Englishman, a love of 
fair play, that induced such men as the late Duke of 
York, many noblemen of high rank, and others, to 
countenance the prize-ring by their presence. 

Calais has great attractions in the eyes of a 
" Levanter," but, I imagine, in his only : he sleeps 
securely within its walls, and does not dream of those 
which might have held him within their stern embrace 
in his own country. With all its disagreeables of 
" canaux et canaille," and its deficiencies of all sorts, 
there is one fact which must recommend Calais, not 
only to the debtor, but to every Englishman, above 
all the towns in 

" The vine-covered hills and gay regions of France " — 

it is the nearest to Shakespeare's Cliff in that country 
of England, which the Beau, in the amusing quint- 
essence of his refinement, always spoke of as 
" Albion." 

Various are the shades of guilt or necessity that 
have made it expedient for so many of our country- 
men to expatriate themselves to this uninteresting 
place, and to give a detailed account of the reasons 


3i4 THE LIFE OF 

which have induced the greater portion of the English 
residents to cross the Channel would, indeed, be a 
work of labour, and invidious as well as useless; but, 
without concerning oneself upon the subject, it was 
impossible to take a morning walk and not meet some 
of them loitering about the streets, and hearing of 
their various misdemeanours. 

The " table-d'hdte," at the Royal, introduced me 
to a countryman, who was, I firmly believed, an 
unfortunate e'chappe of some sort, but what I could 
not divine; and such a surmise was not uncharitable 
at Calais, where a " table-d'hote " is scarcely en regie 
without one. 

The stranger sat opposite to me, and I saw at the 
first glance that he was not a debtor; or, if so, not 
a chevalier cCindustrie, or a ruined man about town; 
he was too well dressed to be either; moreover, his 
countenance had not the slightest characteristic of 
the genus Diddler. His face was one of those faces 
which the French call impassible, and looked as if it 
had never been ruffled since his last flagellation at 
school, some fifty years before. I allude only to his 
nose and mouth, for his eyes were concealed by a 
pair of dark-green goggles, which defied all specula- 
tion as to the shape or colour of the features behind 
them. During the repast he ate but little, and spoke 
less; and I observed that he appeared very uneasy 
and fidgety whenever the door was opened by the 
servants on entering the salle. Once, too, during 
dinner, he removed his spectacles, and then I saw 


BE A U BR UMMELL. 31 5 

that his eyes were as strong as the bull's-eyes in a 
ship's deck : indeed, I felt from this moment certain 
that they were put on as a disguise. While specu- 
lating, however, in my own mind what this mysterious 
elderly gentleman could be, or why, with such eyes, 
he wore goggles, the dinner concluded — and as I was 
sipping the remainder of my Bordeaux and watching 
the assiduous manner in which he continued chopping 
up his apple-parings, the waiter came in and announced 
the arrival of the English mail. Ah ! how strangely 
was the stout gentleman agitated at this intelligence ! 
how he chopped away ! I could hear him breathing 
as loud as the beast in Sinbad's cave; and his com- 
plexion, from being the colour of the vin ordinaire 
before him, became as white as the table-cloth — 
indeed, whiter, for that was, as usual at every " table- 
d'hote," anything but white. "Are you unwell, sir?" 
said I across the table. " No, sir, thank you," 
replied the stranger hesitatingly; and, while he was 
yet speaking, the garfon again entered with a bundle 
of English newspapers. The forced calmness of his 
demeanour now forsook Jiim altogether; off went his 
goggles, and, before the papers were well out of the 
waiter's hands, he seized one of them. How he 
trembled as he tore away the envelope ! — how he 
buried his eyes in the type ! He seemed to throw 
each into a different column, to skim it the quicker — 
down the middle and up again; his organs of vision 
were fairly dancing a country-dance. At length the 
Times was scanned, was searched in every part, and, 


316 THE LIFE OF 

having terminated his examination, he, to my surprise, 
threw it down, quite careless of the general contents. 

The suspicious goggles were then replaced, and 
monosyllables came slowly from between his half- 
closed lips — " Oh ! ha ! very odd ! " and then a groan, 
and then a pause, — and then a " Not yet," like the 
thief in Ali Baba; and the good man threw himself 
back in his chair with a most hopeless expression of 
countenance. Very soon after he left the room, and 
my compassion being increased rather than diminished, 
I followed him out into the court-yard of the hotel, and 
approached him. " You appeared anxious to see the 
paper, sir," said I, " was there any news? " " No- 
thing particular," replied the stout gentleman; " funds 
wonderfully high — wonderfully high; ninety-three, 
sir, ninety-three; but it is a mere flash in the pan. 
Peel must go out." How I happened to fix upon the 
subject I know not, but my next inquiry was, whether 
the election petitions were concluded. He started, as 
if I had been a rattlesnake; and, struggling to gain 
composure for his answer, another " Not yet " came 
from his rotundity in thick and laboured accents. In 
a few minutes he was confidential, and I was informed 
why he was domiciled in Calais. "Sir, you see 
before you a most unfortunate individual; but let me 
ask you first of all whether you are a Whig?" 
" No, sir," said I, " I am not now, they are extinct." 
" Well, sir, Whig or Tor " — I frowned — " Conservative 
I mean, — no offence, sir, — I hope no offence, but 
cannot you feel for a man in my situation? " " That 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 317 

I can," I replied; " but pray what is your situation? 
are you in debt, sir? " " In debt ! no, sir; " and 
the gentleman looked dreadfully shocked at the impu- 
tation,— the green spectacles rose at least half an inch. 
" Why then here? " I continued. " Ah, sir ! you 
may well inquire why I, one of the first merchants in 
Liverpool, am living in this froghole of a place. I 
hate the French, sir, and thank Heaven I do not 
speak a word of their language : the fact is," — and the 
old man sunk his voice to a whisper, and looked 
anxiously round the court, — " the fact is, sir, I am 
here to get out of the way, sir — out of the way of a 
Speaker's warrant." Then came all the details of the 
election, how the Tory member bribed, and how the 
affable Lady Anne had induced him to administer to 
the necessity of the electors on the other side; and 
finally, what a martyr he was to the cause. 

A month in Calais, away from his wife and children, 
and his coal fire and bottle of port, to say nothing of 
his ledgers, had however worked a miracle with the 
enthusiastic reformer, and most solemnly did he swear 
never to have anything more to do with elections or 
Lady Annes again. " Sir, they may return who they 
like for me in future; " and as the exiled merchant 
said this we reached the Grande Place. There he 
drew my attention to several Englishmen who were 
promenading up and down, and pointed out certain 
individuals amongst them who had acquired an un- 
enviable notoriety in England. " That person crossing 
the square," said my informant, " is Mr. R o, who 


3i8 THE LIFE OF 

figured in the Exchequer Bill affair; that one moving 

off through the crowd is Mr. M , a forger in 

another line; and that dissipated-looking fellow cross- 
ing to the Hotel de Ville, at one time drove his four- 
in-hand, and was one of the most wealthy commoners 
in England. The only thing he drives now is a hard 
bargain, which he does with every tradesman he deals 
with." A political refugee was next pointed out as 
the ex-radical candidate for Marylebone; and in con- 
versation with him, was a dark-looking, pock-marked, 
black - whiskered man in a blue greatcoat and two 
yards of red comforter. "Who do you think he 
is? " said my cicerone. " I can't imagine; perhaps 
a fisherman." 

" Oh no ! he is an English policeman in disguise, 
just come over to arrest three well-known jail-birds, 
who have lately committed a burglary with horrible 
violence near Nottingham; and, as I live, sir, there go 
the rascals — look ! near the cafe, in fustian jackets and 
corduroys. See how they are laughing at B 64; and 
well they may, for do you know the French Govern- 
ment has refused to give the scoundrels up ! The 
only chance the policeman has is to kidnap them 
when they are drunk, and smuggle them on board the 
packet; but he has been here a fortnight, and they 
have not yet given him an opportunity." " And are 
you acquainted with any of the soi-disant gentlemen 
delinquents? " " Oh no ! " replied my now talkative 
acquaintance; "I heard their histories from the English- 
man who sat on my right at the ' table d'hdte.' He

meets every packet that comes in, and if it arrives in 
the morning, knows, before I meet him at dinner, the 
name, height, parentage, and age of half the passengers; 
their business, both here and at home; whether they 
are in the army or the fleet, the church or the law; 
whether they are travelling solely for amusement or 
escaping from their creditors; or whether they are, 
like myself, sir, keeping out of the way of a Speaker's 
warrant. I know your name, sir; your name is 
Jesse; you are in the army; you live at Brighton; 
and your age is thirty-two." "And how on earth 
does he know this? " said I. " Easy enough," replied 
my acquaintance; " my right-hand neighbour is ac- 
quainted with all the commissionaires, and sees all the 
passports when they take them to be vise's" 

A man-monkey, in a cocked hat and red breeches, 
who had just perched himself on a chair to astonish 
the natives of the environs (for it was market-day), 
now commenced " Grenadier, que tu m'affliges ! " in 
tones less human than those of his crazy violin; and, 
making my bow to the irreproachable and independent 
elector, I elbowed my way through the crowd, and 
soon found myself at the door of Mons. Leleux, in 
the Rue Royale, where Brummell lodged during his 
residence at Calais.

M. LELEUX'S house, originally the old Hotel d'Angleterre, 
is on the right-hand side of the street, and but a few 
yards from the Hotel de Ville : the two oval frames 
that are still seen over what in former days was the 
gateway, once encircled portraits of George the Second 
and his Queen; but these has reliefs were destroyed 
by the rioters during the popular outbreaks of the 
Revolution. Half-a-dozen doors farther on, is a shop 
which has for its sign " Au Pauvre Diable," not an 
inappropriate one in the town of Calais. 

Pressing down the latch of M. Leleux's door, the 
noise of which was the signal for opening another at 
the extremity of the shop, I stood in the presence of 
the best bookseller in Calais, and one of its most 
goodnatured-looking citizens. His cap, with that old 
snipebill-looking peak so commonly seen in France, 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 321 

and my best Andre, were immediately raised; and to 
my request that he would assist me in gleaning some 
intelligence of the deceased Beau, he acceded with 
ready politeness, and with a frank and soldier-like 
bearing that I certainly thought smacked not of the 
Garde Nationals. In my further intercourse with him 
I found that my surmise was correct : it had been 
acquired in the tent of Miranda, during the wars of 
the South American republics, for M. Leleux was 
secretary to that celebrated man. His countenance 
lighted up as he spoke of his old lodger; and, having 
opened the trenches of conversation, by taking a large 
pinch of snuff, he commenced a kind of recitative of 
his sayings and doings, which unfortunately amounted 
to very little in the end. " Ah, mon cher Monsieur," 
said the old militaire, "je n'ai aucun documens de lui. 
Je pourrais cependant vous fournir quelques petits 
details, et cela volontiers. D'abord, c'est moi qui 
1'avait bien connu, car quatorze ans il a demeure" dans 
cette maison, et je vous ferai voir son appartement; " 
and we ascended the staircase together to the first 
floor. 

" This, sir," observed M. Leleux, in very good 
English, but with a slight accent, " was his drawing- 
room, and this one adjoining, his dining-room; you 
see they are front rooms; his dormitory was on the 
other side of the passage. After he had resided with 
me about five years, I allowed him to have the rooms 
a little to the left of these; they are approached by 

a different staircase : that suite consisted of a dining- 
VOL. i. x 


322 THE LIFE OF 

room on the ground-floor, and a drawing-room over 
it, and a handsome bedroom at the back. It was at 
this time Mr. Brummell's ambition to obtain the office 
of consul at Calais, and the gentleman who held it 
being then in very bad health, made him rather 
sanguine on the point. The expectation, however, 
was never fulfilled, for he is still living, and likely to 
live; but being won over by my locataires persuasive 
manner, I permitted him to decorate his rooms in 
his own way; and though he did it very well, I can 
assure you I was not much the richer for the money 
he laid out. Mais, Monsieur, le pauvre homme 6tait 
si amusant, si amusant, qu'on ne pouvait rien lui 
refuser. Sir, I would have kept him for nothing if 
he would have stayed : ah ! he certainly was a very 
droll fellow." 

Our conversation here terminated, and I took my 
leave; but on a subsequent visit the old gentleman 
showed me over the rooms already alluded to. They 
must have been very comfortable : but the black and 
white marble pavement of the private entrance, which 
Brummell laid down, and the rich crimson paper of 
the dining-room, are all that remain as evidence of 
his acknowledged taste and extravagance. 

I must now " hark back to his burst from London," 
when, in the words of Pope, he bid farewell to the 
" dear d — d distracting town," . and left the box of 

Lady with a joke more than usually satirical. 

The dogs of the law were quickly on the scent; but 
they no sooner reached Dover than they dropped 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 323 

their tails discouraged, for Reynard, instead of run- 
ning to earth, had taken the water, and not a hope 
remained of their catching him. On his arrival at 
Calais, he took up his temporary abode at Dessin's 
hotel, then in the hands of Quillacq, to whom he 
sold his carriage : he remained there a short time, 
and afterwards hired a set of rooms belonging to the 
same proprietor. 

When Brummell left London, he was living at 
No. 13 Chapel Street, Park Lane, to which house 
he had removed from Chesterfield Street some time 
before; it belonged to Mr. Hart, the Duke of Glou- 
cester's steward. The change appears to have been 
much for the worse, a mews gracing one side of the 
house; his tradesmen also began to whisper that 
he was getting shaky, and would not pay much 
longer. By the dinner-service and glass that were 
disposed of after he left Chapel Street, it seems that 
he occasionally entertained his friends in his new 
residence, though he had discarded his cook on 
quitting Chesterfield Street. He did not ever replace 
him, and found, no doubt, that other people's viands 
were much cheaper than his own, and quite as good; 
when by any accident he was thrown upon his own 
resources, he managed to content himself with the 
best repast Mr. Brookes could provide; — 

" Liberal Brookes, whose speculative skill 
Was hasty credit and a distant bill." 

A few days after his flight, his furniture and 
effects were sold at public auction by Mr. Christie;

By Mr. Christie, 

On the Premises, No. 13 Chapel Street, Park Lane, 
On Wednesday, May 22nd, and following Day. 

Amongst the articles of Brummell's furniture, were 
a mahogany-framed sliding cheval dressing glass on 
castors, with two brass arms for one light each, a 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 325 

medicine chest, and colour box. The drawing-room 
had a chimney glass, in a carved ebony frame, chintz 
furniture and Brussels carpet; the back drawing- 
room, had also a chimney glass, book-shelves, and 
library bookcase. The dinner service consisted of 
twelve oval dishes, twenty soup-plates, seventy-eight 
meat ditto, nine wine-coolers, a breakfast service for 
eight persons, three claret jugs, twelve hock glasses, 
forty wine ditto, decanters, &c. There were sixteen 
pairs of sheets, forty huckaback towels, napkins, &c. 
Amongst the Sevres china was a pair of oval vases, 
which sold for nineteen guineas; they were green, 
with flowers and fruit, and mouldings of burnished 
gold. A small cup and cover of the same, eighteen 
pounds. An ewer and basin, mazarine blue and gold 
ground, richly ornamented with birds and exotics 
finely painted in compartments, with the name of each 
specimen upon them; the handle of this ewer was 
silver gilt, and the lot fetched twenty-six pounds. 
There were also a variety of chocolate cups and other 
articles, a clock of Vulliamy's, a letter scale — (no 
doubt, all his letters were franked) — the design a 
figure of Cupid, weighing a heart with a brace of 
doves; this was in or-molu on a black marble plinth. 
A silver tea-kettle embossed and chased, brought 
forty-seven pounds. There were only six spoons and 
four forks — how did they happen to be left behind? 

Amongst the books were some good historical 
works, the Standard Poets, two editions of Shakes- 
peare, his friend Ellis's Specimens of Early English 


326 THE LIFE OF 

Metrical Romances, bound in curiously raised calf; 
the Quarterly and Edinburgh, the Memoirs of de 
Grammont, Chesterfield's Letters, Berrington's Abelard 
and Eloisa, and a large collection of novels now for- 
gotten. A family party at dinner, by Holmes, fetched 
eighty-five guineas. There were also editions of Flax- 
man's designs for the Iliad, ^Eschylus, and Burger's 
Leonora; a copy of the Musde Fran^ais, portraits for 
the Memoirs of de Grammont, prints by Cipriani and 
Bartolozzi, a portrait in oils of his father's benefactor, 
Lord North, and portraits of Nelson, Pitt, the Duke 
of Rutland, and George the Third. The Beauvais 
Claret sold for five pounds eight shillings; the Cham- 
pagne, three pounds five shillings; and the Port, four 
pounds per dozen. 

The sale was attended by many members of the 
fashionable world, every one being apparently anxious 
to purchase something; the Duke of York was not 
there, but he gave orders for some Sevres china to be 
bought for him. Purchases were made in this manner 
by many of his friends. Amongst the company pre- 
sent were Lords Bessborough and Yarmouth, Lady 
Warburton, Sir Henry Smyth, Sir H. Peyton, Sir 
W. Burgoyne, Sir T. Stepney, Colonels Sheddon and 
Cotton, General Phipps, Mr. Massy Dawson, Acland, 
of the Albany, Mr. Mills, of Park Street, Mr. Tower, 
and the Rev. — Belli. 

The competition for the knick-knacks and articles 
of virtit was very great; amongst them was a very 
handsome snuff-box, which, on being opened by the 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 327 

auctioneer before it was put up, was found to contain 
a piece of paper with the following sentence, in Brum- 
mell's handwriting, upon it : — " This snuff-box was 
intended for the Prince Regent, if he had conducted 
himself with more propriety towards me." The proceeds 
of the sale amounted to about eleven hundred pounds, 
and the sum was paid to the Sheriff of Middlesex. 

But I must return to Calais. Brummell remained 
but a few months in M. Quillacq's lodgings, from 
them he removed to the house of M. Leleux, where he 
remained till he left for Caen, in the month of Septem- 
ber of 1830. He was no sooner in possession of his 
new apartments, than he set about furnishing them in 
the most expensive manner; and fi ve-and-twenty thou- 
sand francs, which he took with him, or received shortly 
after his arrival at Calais, were quickly spent in mak- 
ing himself perfectly comfortable in his new abode. 
He had quite an old dowager's passion for buhl 
furniture; and in the indulgence of this taste, he 
expended large sums of money. Many of the most 
recherche articles that adorned his salon were brought 
from Paris by a courier, who executed these and other 
commissions for him, and who gained a profit of thirty 
thousand francs upon the purchases he made, during 
the ten or twelve years he was thus employed. This 
was a large sum; but Brummell, in his absurd mania 
for such things, sometimes disbursed half as much in 
one year. Sometimes a chef-d'oeuvre, a darling cabinet, 
did not suit; it had then to be disposed of, which it 
was for half the original cost; at other times, a perfect 


3z8 THE LIFE OF 

gem had to be sent back to Paris, of course at his own 
expense; or perhaps the article was exchanged; in 
this case his commissionnaire profited both as buyer and 
seller. 

At length, having bestowed incalculable pains, and 
many sleepless nights and anxious days, upon this 
interesting and important subject, he managed, in spite 
of his extreme fastidiousness and his poverty, to 
collect a sufficient quantity of buhl and or-molu to 
furnish his three rooms in the elegant and costly style 
of Louis Quatorze; and they would have commanded 
the approbation of the most enrage buhl-furniture- 
fancier of his former clique. He also squandered 
large sums in bronzes, japanned screens, and whims 
of every description. On one side of his drawing- 
room stood a large cabinet, with brass wire doors; 
these were kept locked with the most jealous care; 
for they protected, from the familiar and dangerous 
inspection of his visitors, a service of extremely 
beautiful Sevres china. The designs were most 
exquisite, and on each rplate was represented, in 
colours chaster than the originals, all the celebrated 
beauties that held such powerful sway over the courts 
of Louis the Fourteenth and Fifteenth; and, as they 
were not few in number, the reader may imagine that 
his inanimate but elegant harem completely filled his 
buhl seraglio. These portraits were so charmingly 
done, that the Beau, in the true spirit of a sultan, 
used to inform his visitors, that it was " almost 
profanation even to look at these frail fair ones." 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 329 

The walls of this room were covered with pictures 
and prints — a few of the former being from the pencil 
of a young artist of the town/ who was patronised 
by the Beau by way of encouragement. Some 
favourite books, in handsome suits of morocco or silk, 
reposed on the card-tables; and, on the circular one 
in the centre of the apartment, lay a little crowd of 
valuable snuff-boxes, miniatures, card-cases, paper- 
weights, and knives, and portfolios, in every variety 
of gold, enamel, mother-of-pearl, ivory, and tortoise- 
shell, embossed leather, and embroidered satin. 
Amongst this collection of expensive trifles were an 
or-molu greyhound and a presse-papier of Sienna 
marble, surmounted by a small bronze eagle; the 
latter was presented to him, as a souvenir, by 
Monsieur de Montrond, Talleyrand's foreman, and had 
at one time pressed the despatches and private papers 
of Napoleon.1 It is now in the author's possession, 
and not the less valued for having once belonged to 
the greatest and bitterest enemy England ever had. 

Many amongst the multitude of little bijoux that 
ornamented this table were esteemed by him far 
beyond their intrinsic value; some of them were the 
cadeaux of royalty, and, could they have spoken, 
especially those that were the gift of an amiable 
woman, whose charitable remembrance of him will be 
hereafter alluded to, they might have wiled away 
many of his lonely hours. His passion for snuff- 
boxes was extreme : he had one which he only could

33o THE LIFE OF 

open, and some friend of his, while he was at Belvoir, 
tried it with his knife, with the intention, no doubt, 
of purloining his snuff, which was always excellent. 
Hearing of the outrage, Brummell said, " Confound 
the fellow ! he takes my snuff-box for an oyster : " 
but notwithstanding the splendid collection he pos- 
sessed, and having sent his friend Capel, by per- 
mission of the First Lord, to Naples, to procure 
him a perfect tabatiere, he actually had one of black 
shell and gold built at Calais. This he gave to the 

Duke of B , in exchange for a bank-note of fifty 

pounds; in other words, that nobleman consented to 
receive it that he might with more delicacy present him 
with that sum — for, though a ruined man, Brummell 
had not yet been subjected to all the dirty degradations 
that invariably accompany that character, when his ruin 
is the result of premeditated folly and unrestrained in- 
dulgence. This sketch of the drawing-room would be 
incomplete if I omitted to mention, that the table-cover 
on which all his useless elegancies were displayed was 
worked for him by the Duchess of York, and that his 
easy-chair was the gift of the same kind friend. 

Correctness of taste in everything was decidedly 
the Beau's forte, and, seated in his fauteut'I, sur- 
rounded by his buhl, paintings, prints, knick-knacks, 
and the Sevres portraits of the beautiful La Valliere 
and her discreet rival, he appeared, amongst the 
heterogeneous medley of English who subsequently 
attended his levee, nearly the only living creature in 
keeping with the room and its details.

Donations made to Brummcll by his Friends — The Duchess of York's 
Liberality to Him — Her Christmas Present and Letter — Mr. Cham- 
berlayne — Brummell learns French — Scrape Dames' s Description of

Exile's Daily Avocations — His dog Vick — Her Illness and Death — 
Anecdote from " Granby " — Brummell's Grief at the Loss of his Pet. 

CONSIDERING the reduced state of his circumstances, 
the reader will naturally inquire how it happened 
that Brummell managed to gratify a taste so little in 
accordance with them? The answer is, that though 
a man of fashion, he had an extraordinary number 
of good friends; and the sums of money that he 
must have received from various sources, many of 
them unknown, attest the fact, that he was, at this 
time, even too generously assisted. A clerk of M. 
de Vos, a Calais banker, called on him one morning 
to place a large sum in his hands, that had been 
paid into their bank the day before; it was stated to 
me to have been a thousand pounds, but supposing 
it was only half that amount, it was a large donation. 
So strict was the incognito preserved, that the for- 
tunate recipient could never trace the gift to the 


332 THE LIFE OF 

generous individual who sent it. But in the circle 
of those who administered not only to his wants but 
to his luxuries (the evil day had not yet come, when 
he was to find the utmost difficulty in procuring the 
necessaries of life), no one appears to have extended 
relief to the expatriated Beau, with more warmth of 
feeling or delicacy of manner, than the late Duchess 
of York. The "votre toute-affectionne'e amie et ser- 
vante " of more prosperous times, was practically 
illustrated towards him to the day of Her Royal 
Highness's death. Every year at Christmas some 
token of regard was conveyed to him; a purse, 

a card-case, or note-keeper, the work of her own 

• 

fair hands; Brummell treasured these proofs of the 
Duchess's taste and skill, and had several of them 
remaining when he was at Caen. These little marks 
of her regard, when opened, were never found empty, 
and a rustling was always heard within their folds, 
which no doubt fell agreeably upon ears now so little 
familiar with the sound of bank-notes. 

Here is a note she wrote to him when Brummell 
had only left his native land about a year, and 
when one of her letters addressed to the Beau 
had miscarried : — 

" Londres, ce 26 April 1817. 

" Vous n'avez rien perdu a la lettre qui vous etait 
destined, et que Lord Alvanley a consignee aux 
flammes; elle contenait seulement mes remercimens 
pour les charmans cadeaux que vous avez eu la bontx 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 333 

de m'envoyer (dont je me suis pare"e le soir mfime de 
ma petite fete), et mes regrets que vous n'en e"tiez 
plus. Ces regrets se renouvellent journellement, et 
surtout les raisons qui en sont la cause. Croyez 
que personne ne sent plus la perte de votre societe 
que je le fais; je n'oublierai jamais les momens 
agreables que je lui ai dus, et tout ce qui pourrait 
m'en compenser serait la certitude de votre bonheur 
pour lequel je ferai (les voeux) les plus sinceres 
comme pour ce qui peut y contribuer le plus efficace- 
ment, me flattant que vous conserverez toujours quel- 
que souvenir de votre toute affectionnee amie et 
servante, F." 

But women are ever the most lasting in their 
attachments, whether of love or friendship, and the 
conduct of this royal lady is the more meritorious 
on account of her high rank; for the opportunities 
which persons in her exalted station have of witness- 
ing the miseries of human nature are few, and, from 
ignorance rather than indifference, they frequently are 
not so much alive to the sufferings of mankind as 
those who daily witness those sufferings : they bask in 
the sunshine of perpetual personal comfort, and, while 
plenty is ever pouring forth her blessings around them, 
no beggar is allowed to tread the palace courts — 
poverty is scarcely bold enough to make its appeal to 
their hearts in person, and language in the form of a 
petition, however strongly worded, does not truthfully 
and vividly describe what they seldom or never see. 


334 THE LIFE OF 

The Duke of Gloucester also treated Brummell 
with much kindness and consideration, and when His 
Royal Highness, in his way through Calais, went 
down to the packet to embark, Brummell always 
accompanied him : had he only imbibed a small por- 
tion of the Duke's punctuality in the weekly audit of 
his accounts, he might perhaps have had the satis- 
faction of one day returning in his company to the 
opposite shore. He had also a kind friend in John 
Chamberlayne, Esq., who contributed to his comfort 
by the payment of a yearly gratuity, which it was 
his intention to continue in the event of his own 
decease; but, becoming afflicted by insanity, he left 
no will. This was a sad chance for Brummell : he 
wrote to his representatives on the subject, but the 
answer was unfavourable; and it was intimated to 
him that there was no memorandum to that effect 
among Mr. Chamberlayne's papers. The Duke of 
Argyle, though not affluent, seldom forgot to call and 
assist him with money; and Lord Alvanley, who 
never passed his door without doing the same, 
invariably dined with him; the dinner, bien entendu, 
being sent from Dessin's at his Lordship's expense. 

Many other noblemen and gentlemen at various 
periods relieved the dull tenor of his life by their 
visits; and from each he received substantial proofs 
of their regard. Among them were the Dukes of 
Wellington, Rutland, Richmond, Beaufort, and Bed- 
ford; Lords Sefton, Jersey, Willoughby d'Eresby, 
Craven, Ward, and Stuart de Rothesay. To the 


Duke of Gloucester 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 335 

assistance tendered him by his friends, may of course 
be added that of his relatives. His principal corre- 
spondents were the Duke and Duchess of York, Lord 
Alvanley, and J. Chamberlayne, Esq. 

In the early part of his residence at Calais, he led 
a very retired life, for he was unable to speak French 
with fluency, and his mornings and evenings were 
occupied in perfecting himself in that language : he 
could not otherwise have entered a French salon with 
any degree of comfort; the English society he abomi- 
nated, and frequented it only during the latter part 
of his stay there, when he had grown less difficult 
and less exclusive. 

Nothing could be more indicative that Brummell 
had ability and energy, when the occasion suited him 
to exercise it, than the proficiency he attained in 
French; for, as will be seen in the sequel, he made 
himself master of the language, and could, for an 
Englishman, write an excellent letter. Byron's 
anecdote of Scrope Davies, given in Moore's Life of 
the noble poet, is delightfully incorrect : — " When 
Brummell retired to France," says his Lordship, " he 
knew no French, and having obtained a grammar for 
the purpose of study, our friend Scrope Davies was 
asked what progress Brummell had made in French? 
He responded, that the Beau had been ' stopped, like 
Buonaparte in Russia, by the elements.' " Like 
many other good things told of Brummell, it is 
deficient in the desideratum necessary to give it value 

1 See Vol. II., chapter V. 


336 THE LIFE OF 

— truth. During the period that the army of occupa- 
tion remained in France, he enjoyed the society of 
several of his old friends, who were serving with it, 
and many others on their way to Paris, which capital 
was then all alive with the revelry and dissipation of 
foreigners, and emigres who had been exiled from the 
Trois Freres, Very's, and rouge et noir, for upwards 
of twenty years : the chief of our gallant army, also, 
paid the town some flying visits en route to or from 
England, and I have heard it asserted, without, at 
this period, noticing his great rival in notoriety; but 
at length the most good-natured man in all England, 

the Marquis of , effected a reconciliation between 

them, and, from this time, his Grace never passed 
Brummell's door without inquiring after him, and 
sometimes giving him an invitation to dine with him 
at Dessin's. This was sometimes announced from his 
carriage, as he went by, for he had not, of course, a 
minute to spare. 

It appears that the late Lord Westmoreland, when 
passing through Calais, also called on him, and said 
how happy he should be if he would dine with him 
that day at three o'clock ! Brummell's answer was 
truly characteristic : — " Your Lordship is very kind; 
but I really could not feed at that early hour ! " 
"When I first knew Brummell at Eton," said the 
courteous old gentleman who sent me this anecdote, 
" we daily dined together at twelve, and fed very 
heartily ! " 

But Brummell, soon after his arrival, had less 


Lore/ Westmoreland 


BEAU DRUM ME LL. 337 

distinguished and agreeable visitors than either the 
Duke or Lord Westmoreland. On one occasion an 
itinerant communicater of the legal house of Howard 
and Gibbs tapped softly at his door, with the inten- 
tion of presenting some law paper for his signature, 
or consideration : " Come in," said the Beau, deceived 
by so gentle an application for admittance; his 
visitor's head, on a level with the latch, was instantly 
in the room — his body being cautiously kept in the 
passage. " Why, you little rascal," screamed the 
astonished George Bryan Brummell aforesaid, directly 
he saw him, " are you not hung yet? begone ! " The 
head obeyed, the door closed, and the little body 
departed. 

His routine of life at Calais was methodical in the 
extreme; he rose at nine, breakfasted off cafe au lait, 
and sat reading the Morning Chronicle, brochures, or 
books (that is, after his Levizac had been laid aside), 
till twelve; precisely at that hour he might be seen 
in a flowing brocade dressing-gown and velvet cap, 
like the beret of the olden time, crossing the passage 
to his bedroom; and so punctually did he keep to 
stated hours, that his landlord's " devils " used to 
exclaim, when he appeared, " Ah ! voila Monsieur 
Brummell; c'est midi," and they immediately struck 
work, and went to their dinner. 

The business of his toilet now commenced, and 
this occupied a considerable part of two hours : from 
the time that was completed he held his levee, and 

sat en prince chatting with his friends. If it was

in the summer, he resorted to the open window of 
his charming drawing-room, and apostrophised his 
acquaintance as they passed. " Brummell ! " shouted 
one of them to him under his window, — the Beau 
looked out, — " have you heard the news? " " No, 

what's the matter?" "Why, S , the banker, 

ran off last night." " Well, what of that? " " Why, 
I have lost a thousand francs." " Have you? then, 
my good fellow, in future take a hint from me, and 
always keep your banker in advance." At four 
o'clock he stepped into the Rue Royale, as well 
turned out as he ever did into St. James's Street, 
in the very meridian of his glory. A walk on the 
ramparts, or to his garden at the foot of them, killed 
the next hour; but he walked more pour se distraire 
than for exercise, his " long walk," as he termed it, 
being out of one gate and in at the other, the two 
being about a hundred yards apart. The fact was 
that Vick, his terrier, was so afflicted with embonpoint, 
that even during this short promenade he was obliged 
to turn round and wait for her at least a dozen times 
before he had accomplished fifty paces. His partiality 
for this dog was extreme. Vick was once very ill, 
so he sent for two of his friends, learned in the 
diseases of the canine race, who, on their arrival, 
found her laid upon his bed, and Brummell in great 
distress standing by her side. An examination of her 
condition having taken place, the two dogopathists 
opined that she ought to be bled. " Bled ! " said her 
master, turning away, " I shall leave the room; 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 339 

inform me when the operation is over." When poor 
Vick died he shed tears, and observed to Mr. 
Marshall, in his usual cynical tone, that he had "lost 
the only friend he had in the world," meaning, most 
likely, in the world of Calais. 

Lister has introduced a version of this anecdote in 
" Granby," but there is a difference in the dog's name 
and species, and the time and place. The scene I 
allude to is laid at a nobleman's house in the country, 
where he broke up a prolix conversation one morning 
by making his poodle perform some laughable tricks, 
and directing the attention of the company to the 
beauty of his dog. " Come here, Polisson," he said, 
" come here and show yourself; is not he magnificent? 
Look at these tufts, I had him shorn by the best 
tondeuse in Paris. Lady Harriet, I'll give you her 
direction." " Oh thank you ! how handsome he is ! 
he must be quite a treasure." " Oh ! invaluable : 
when Polisson dies I shall steal for him Lord Byron's 
epitaph on his Newfoundland dog; then I shall say, 
with my hand on my heart (speaking of my friends), 
' I have never had but one, and there he lies,' " point- 
ing to the dog who was stretched upon the hearth- 
rug. 

Poor Vick was buried, by his special desire, in 
Dessin's garden; and though her master did not 
actually put on mourning, he talked seriously of 
erecting a monument to her memory. His salon was 
peremptorily closed against visitors for three days, 
and it was several weeks before he permitted any one 


340 THE LIFE OF 

to speak of her death. He had subsequently three 
poodles : the most famous of the trio was called 
" Atous" and had been trained by a soldier of the 
garrison. This dog was a perfect specimen of canine 
intelligence, and he turned out for his walk at four, quite 
as neat as Brummell. His great accomplishment was to 
take a hot muffin from the plate before the fire, and 
run round the room offering it to the company; but 
poor " Atous " also died, and Brummell was again a 
prey to grief. Like a true cynic, his eye was seldom 
if ever moistened on hearing of the death of a friend, 
though a flood of tears was always ready when his 
dogs died. His poodle was regretted because it was 
constantly in his presence, and his decease left a blank 
in the daily routine of his habits and ideas. 

But to resume the sketch of his diurnal proceedings. 
At five o'clock precisely he ascended the staircase to 
his rooms, and dressed for dinner, which was sent from 
Dessin's at six : at this meal he washed his oesophagus 
with a bottle of Dorchester ale, of which he had always 
a barrel in the house. This showed plainly indeed 
that he had " fallen from his high estate," and was 
fain now to treat with rather less contempt than he 
felt on hearing it — the sarcastic remark of the alder- 
man, for the beverage was at least malt liquor. This 
potent stuff was followed by a liqueur glass of brandy, 
which he always took during dinner, and the rear was 
brought up by a bottle of Bordeaux; a pretty comfort- 
able refection for a man who lived entirely on the 
charity of his friends. 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 34t 

It was after one of these niggardly repasts that he 
is said to have written to the late Lord Sefton that he 
was " lying on straw, and grinning through the bars 
of a gaol; eating bran bread, my good fellow, eating 
bran bread." I will not, however, vouch for the truth 
of the story. The double X did not take great effect 
upon his brain; for though not given to excess, he 
had been well accustomed to a tolerable quantity of 
wine, to say nothing of Roman punch, into the 
mysteries of which it has been asserted that he 
initiated the Prince Regent. One who knew him 
intimately at Calais, assured me that he had never 
seen him inebriated but once, and then he was so 
disgusted with himself that he performed a voluntary 
penance of solitary confinement for eight days; query, 
with or without his Dorchester ale? At seven o'clock, 
or half-past, he went to the theatre, where he had a 
small box; or in the long warm evenings he retired 
to his garden, in the summer-house of which (now 
thrown down) he either read or noted down his 
recollections of his past career.

SUCH was the general tenor of his life, varied occa- 
sionally by a dinner at the consul's, or a visit from 
some friend of former years— a few of these stray 
birds of fashion would sometimes delay their departure 
for two or three days, merely to enjoy a laugh at the 
fund of anecdotes with which he was charged; and 
one of them, who had a house at Dover, frequently 
crossed the water to see him, and always gave him 
notice of his intention, desiring that he would have 
all in readiness for his party at the Hotel, himself 
included. At these little fetes, he was always in 
good spirits, and as amusing as ever. One day after 
dinner, the elegant Beau, though always on the qui 
vive that his proceedings should be faultless, upset 
a cup of coffee on the cloth. The bell was rung for 
thev waiter to remove it, and on his appearing for 
that purpose he gave him to understand, with the 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 343 

most imperturbable gravity, that a young and graceful 
lady, the daughter of his friend, had committed this 
piece of gaucherie. Directly, however, he had left 
the room, the real delinquent hastened to apologise 
and soften the indignation of the innocent victim, or 
at least attempted to do so; adding drolly to a string 
of excuses, " You know it would never have done 
to let the world know that / was guilty of such 
awkwardness." This was not very chivalrous; even 
if his fair neighbour had really spilt it, it would have 
been more goodnatured, if not so entertaining, to 
have taken the odium on himself — mais son ego'isme 
rcgnait partont. 

But, however glad he might be to accept any 
invitation that promised to afford him amusement 
within the walls of the town, his friends could never 
succeed in persuading him to spend one night away 
from his own rooms. Lord Alvanley did, I believe, 
once prevail upon him to go to Dunkirk, and his 
landlord thought that he would at any rate not return 
that night; but he was mistaken, for at four o'clock 
in the morning, Brummell knocked at the door. The 
Beau appeared much flattered and pleased by any 
attentions paid him by his itinerant visitors, and 
always endeavoured to be more than usually agree- 
able to them — if that were possible, though he could 
not deny himself a joke, if it came into his head. I 
remember, said one of his Calais friends, that when 
sitting with him one morning, in walked Wellesley 
Poole, who had just landed from the Dover packet; 


3u THE LIVE Or 

it happened to be a very cold day, and the new 
arrival drew his chair close to the fire; this Brummcll 
observed, and said, "Why, Wellesley, you appear 
cold ! but I am not surprised at it, for you must 
have been devilish hot in England, or we should 
never have seen you here." 

It was not till his old friends, Mr. G. C m, 

Sir Arthur F s, and afterwards Col. D , 

Berkeley Craven, and Henry Berkeley, came and 
fixed themselves at Calais, that Brummell entered 
at all into the English society of the place, and 
then with great discrimination in the choice of his 
acquaintances. 

But, even in spite of this caution, he sometimes 
came in contact with his friends' friends, whose 
manners were most disagreeable to him. At one 
house at which he visited, the master kept a kind of 
fag, a tame animal, who was ready to follow him 
anywhere, and eat his dinners. This person was 
also kind enough to market for him, go to the post, 
or to the stables on a cold night — moreover, he was 
obliged to submit to be roasted : not like a former 
Lord Chief Justice, at Eton, once only and in earnest, 
and as a juvenile martyr to the ardour of his political 
opinions, but a discretion, and get no credit for it. 
Nature had done little for this convenient creature of 
a convenient race, and his parents less; but, malgre 
his outlandish bearing, his patron had the bad taste 
to permit him to appear in the presence of his com- 
pany. It happened that on one occasion the Beau 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 345 

was of the party, and shortly after they had sat down 
to dinner, the toady, thrusting out his plate, said, " Mr. 
Brummell, I'll trouble you for a potato." There was 
never a very large supply of silver at the tables of 
the English residents at Calais, and Brummell looked 
right and left for a spoon : but there was none, and 
he paused at the difficulty; the toady, however, tired 
of holding out his arm, quickly relieved him from 
the dilemma by saying in a persuasive tone of voice, 
" Oh, take your fork — I'm not particular." " My 
dear Berkeley," said the Beau afterwards to his 
friend, " how can you ask gentlemen to meet such 
people at dinner? if your horses are ill, pay the 
fellow five francs and have done with him." 

However, [towards the close of his residence at 
Calais, he was not so particular whom he dined with. 
One day, when walking on the ramparts arm-in-arm 
with the late Lord Sefton, they were met by an 
extremely vulgar-looking Englishman, who bowed to 
Brummell in a very familiar manner. " Sefton," said 
the Beau, " what can that fellow mean by bowing to 
you? " " To me ! he is bowing to you, I suppose, 
for I know no one in Calais." Soon after, however, 
the stranger passed again, and, seizing Brummell by 
the arm, said to him in a most frightfully cordial 
tone, " Don't forget, Brum, don't forget, goose at 
four — goose at four ! " thus betraying the Beau's 
engagement to dine with his hospitable but vulgar 
friend, an invitation that he thought he had so 
cleverly concealed from his refined one. It was 


3t6 THE LIFE OF 

while promenading one day on the pier, and not 
long before he left Calais, that an old associate of 
his, who had just arrived by the packet from England, 
met him unexpectedly in the street, and cordially 
shaking hands with him, said, " My dear Brummell, I 
am so glad to see you, for we had heard in England 
that you were dead; the report, I assure you, was 
in very general circulation when I left." " Mere 
stock-jobbing, my good fellow, mere stock-jobbing," 
was the Beau's reply. 

Like all small towns, whether in England or else- 
where, in which the society is limited, there were in 
Calais several male as well as female gossips, whose 
only occupation was, to perambulate from house to 
house, and retail, at each in succession, all that was 
true, and a great deal that was not, that they had 
seen or heard, or neither, in their morning walks. 
Brummell, as well as many others, was subject to 
have everything he said or did carefully discussed, and 
often enlarged upon, by such people; and they fre- 
quently fastened an ill-natured remark, or perhaps a 
good joke, upon him, when he had in fact never heard 
either, till he was called upon to contradict the cancan 
of the day. 

This exaggeration was quite unnecessary as re- 
garded him, for his satirical vein and impudence led 
him to make a sufficient number of pointed and satur- 
nine remarks upon his countrymen, and lay himself 
open to retaliation. But Brummell was more parti- 
cularly severe with those who manifested a disposition 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 347 

to intrude upon him without due introduction, or who 
vulgarly affected to be somebody, when their conduct 
and manners plainly indicated that they had never 
frequented that class of society to which they assumed 
to belong. Those who called themselves colonels or 
captains, without having any claim to the rank, were 
sure to be objects of his displeasure; retired tuft- 
hunters, also, and self-important fat gentlemen, were 
always singled out as targets for his keen and droll 
remarks. Whenever he was asked whether he knew 
any character of this kind, or indeed others more 
agreeable, but not to his mind, his usual reply was, 
" Know him, my good sir? to be sure I do. The 
fellow is a rank impostor; I recollect him perfectly, 
when he was butler at Belvoir." Or, " Don't you 
remember Jones, who kept the snuff-shop in Bond 
Street? that's the very man." In the following in- 
stance, however, he was called upon, in a very sum- 
mary manner, to contradict one of his mischievous 
witticisms. 

The sufferer in this case was a military man, who 
in the Peninsular, or some other war, had had the 
misfortune to be severely wounded in the face — in 
fact, to lose the most prominent feature of it. The 
sarcasm in question at length reached the ears of the 
injured party, and in consequence the Beau was one 
morning disturbed, at his breakfast, by a loud knock- 
ing at the door; his permission to enter was scarcely 
given, when the grisly warrior, with indignation in 
his eyes, and " satisfaction " in his thoughts, stalked 


348 THE LIFE OF 

into the room and confronted him. " Pray, sir," said 
Brummell, rising from his faiitcuil " what happy 
circumstance has induced you to favour me with such 
a very early visit? " " Why the fact is, Mr. Brum- 
mell," replied the veteran, in a tone of voice which at 
once told his aggressor that the circumstance was 
anything but a " happy one," and that if his wit did 
not speedily get him out of the scrape, his valour 
must see him through it; " the fact is, Mr. Brum- 
mell, I have heard that you have been kind enough to 
spread a report about the town, affecting my position 
in society here, by stating, that I am not a retired 
officer, and never held a commission; and that I am 
really nothing more nor less than a retired hatter." 
With admirable presence of mind the Beau listened 
to this accusation, which was certainly delivered in a 
manner savouring more of the camp than St. James's, 
and with much gravity thrown into his countenance, 
he immediately answered, " I am sorry, very sorry, 
that any one should conceive it possible that / could 
be guilty of such a breach of good manners. I can 
assure you, that there is not a word of truth in the 
report." The captain, perfectly satisfied and delighted 
with his reception, now moved towards the door; 
when Brummell followed him to it, and as he was 
leaving the room, again affirmed that the report was 
false; " For," said he, " now I think of it, I never 
in my life dealt with a hatter without a nose." It is 
probable that the officer was not much pleased with 
this unfeeling speech, but he was so taken by surprise 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 349 

that he made no reply, and beat a retreat immediately. 
The only notice that Brummell took of the affair was, 
to express his astonishment the next day that any 
one should have sent him a " death's head ! " 

If his wit provoked a quarrel, it, as in this case, 
generally settled it; for he was by no means a lover 
of the duello. Some years before this period, the 
second of a gentleman, who had received instructions 
to call upon him and demand either satisfaction or an 
apology, is said to have announced his errand in a 
very peremptory manner, and concluded his message 
by saying, that he must apologise in five minutes. 
" In five minutes, sir ! " replied the Beau in a cold 
sweat, " in five seconds, or in less time, if you prefer 
it." Brummell attributed his dislike to assignations in 
defence of his honour to a constitutional tendency 
to knock under. He was, he said, dearly fond of 
notoriety, but not of this particular kind. " My dear 
fellow," observed the Beau to a friend, when convers- 
ing on the subject, " perhaps you are not aware of the 
circumstance, but I am not naturally of an heroic 
turn. Nevertheless, I once had an affair at Chalk- 
farm, and a dreadful state I was in, I can tell you; 
never in my life shall I forget the horrors of the 
previous night ! sleep was out of the question; and I 
passed it in pacing my room, cursing the cruelly good 
joke, for which I was on the eve of being torn from 

Lady and Roman punch for ever. The dawn 

was to me the harbinger of death, not of another 
day; and yet I almost hailed it with pleasure; but my 


35o THE LIFE OF 

second's step upon the stairs soon neutralised the 
feeling; and the horrid details, which he carefully ex- 
plained to me, annihilated the little courage that had 
survived the anxieties of the night. We now left the 
house, and no accident of any kind, no fortunate 
upset, occurred, on our way to the place of ren- 
dezvous; where we arrived, according to my idea 
much too soon, a quarter of an hour before the time 
named. 

" There was no one on the ground, and each minute 
seemed an age, as, in terror and semi-suffocation, I 
awaited my opponent's approach. At length the clock 
of a neighbouring church announced that the hour of 
appointment had come; how its tones, brought by the 
wind across the fields, struck upon my heart ! I felt 
like the criminal, when he hears the bell of St. 
Sepulchre's for the last time : we now looked in the 
direction of town, but there was no appearance of my 
antagonist; my military friend kindly hinted that 
clocks and watches varied, a fact I was well aware of, 
and which I thought he might have spared me the 
pleasure of hearing him remark upon; but a second 
is always such a ' d — d good-natured friend.' The 
next quarter of an hour passed in awful silence, still 
no one appeared, not even in the horizon; my com- 
panion whistled, and, confound him ! looked much 
disappointed; the half-hour struck — still no one; the 
third quarter, and at length the hour. My centurion 
of the Coldstream now came up, this time in truth my 
friend, and said to me, and I can tell you they were 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 351 

the sweetest accents that ever fell upon my ear, ' Well, 

George, I think we may go : ' ' My dear M , I 

replied, ' you have taken a load off my mind, let us go 
immediately ! ' ' Brummell was by no means a bad 
classic, and he no doubt remembered that Horace kept 
a reputation, though he was not carried home upon 
his shield; but though he was certainly no Bayard, 
there is no reason for asserting that he was another 
Bob Acres. Still, when he felt a deficiency in such 
emergencies, he should have applied to his friend, 
Lord Alvanley, who could have lent him as much 
courage then, as he did money afterwards, and that 
was to no trifling extent. 

Once, indeed, he showed fight in a most unusual 
and vigorous manner : it was when the then proprietor 
of a notorious courtesan called to request him to ex- 
plain some insult, with which he was said to have 
regaled the lady, in a morning call that she had made 
him. High words having ensued between Brummell 
and this gentleman, he ordered him to leave the room; 
but finding that he demurred, the exasperated Beau, 
like the Bailie Nicol Jarvie, enforced his commands 
with a red-hot poker that was opportunely resting in 
the fire at the time : in this instance our hero deserved 
the honour of an ovation, for it was a hundred to one 
against him, and his opponent was moreover a man of 
war. If we could muster credulity sufficient to believe 
the Memoirs of this modern Aspasia, who, singularly 
enough, has since turned Roman Catholic, she not 
only held the Beau captive, but in contempt, and this,

too, when he was Nulli Sccundus in London; but it 
is not astonishing that she affected to do so, for he 
must have inspired her with une jalousie dc fcmnic a

man for being more elegant than herself.

THOUGH Brummell read a great deal, his favourite 
matinal avocation was working at a large screen, 
which, when finished, he had destined for the Duchess 
of York; but the pleasure of recording, by this pre- 
sent, his sense of her great kindness, was denied him, 
for Her Royal Highness died before it was completed; 
he then laid it aside, and never resumed his labours. 

This work of taste and patience is a masterpiece 
in its way; and had it ever reached Oatlands, many 
a fair dame and antiquated spinster would have envied 
its royal owner. The screen measures five feet and a 
half in height, and, when opened, is rather more than 
twelve in length; it is divided into six leaves, and the 
ground is of green paper. The idea of a general 
design, with which it was evident Brummell had 

commenced, seems to have been soon laid aside. The

most prominent features of it are the quadrupeds, 
which form the centre of the upper part of each leaf; 
these prints are on a scale much larger than the gener- 
ality of the other drawings. In the first compartment 
is an elephant, the second bears a hyena, the third a 
tiger, the fourth a camel, and the fifth a bear. The 
sixth has no animal upon it. Many of the drawings 
which cover the remaining surface of the screen are 
coloured : the engravings are in line, mezzotint, or 
lithograph, with sketches in chalk, pastel, or pencil; 
in fact, a specimen of every possible variety of the 
limner's or engraver's art, if oils be excepted, is to be 
found upon it. It will therefore be easily imagined, 
that the general effect produced by such a multitude of 
objects of every colour and form, is on the first coup 
(fail very confused : but, on a closer inspection, the 
attention that has been devoted to arrangement of 
almost every part, becomes easily discernible; each 
little pictorial episode, and there are hundreds, is 
encircled by wreaths and garlands of flowers of every 
description; the rose predominating, much to the 
credit of the paster's taste; fruit, and emblems in 
character with the subject to be illustrated, are also 
mingled with the flowers; to give an exact description 
of this glorious piece of fiddle-faddle, the trifling indus- 
try of a thoroughly idle man, would be both useless and 
tedious. I shall therefore merely attempt a slight sketch, 
in the order in which I examined it, commencing with 
the first compartment. 

On this leaf, as I have before remarked, there is 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 355 

an elephant, under the neck of which is a full-faced 
portrait of Napoleon, who, in this case, is the subject 
to be illustrated. By introducing this animal the Beau 
intended to express the Emperor's power; but on the 
throat of the modern king-maker is a butterfly, intended 
to represent another of his attributes, and to neutralise 
his greatness. The portrait is encircled by the neck, 
shoulder, and trunk of this Chouni; l and the edges of 
the two drawings, which would otherwise have been 
discoverable, are concealed by other attributes, as well 
as by fruit and flowers, cut out and arranged with 
infinite pains. This plan of concealing the edges was 
pursued throughout with as much nicety as a semp- 
stress would bestow on the hem of a chemise cfhomine. 
Amongst these emblems, and immediately above the 
Emperor's head, is a mortar elevated for firing; from 
the mouth of it proceeds a sword, round which a 
serpent has entwined itself: a scythe and a flag, with 
the Russian eagle on it, are crossed above the sword, 
and the trophy is completed by laurel branches over 
the emblem of Time. The trumpet of Fame, and a 
port-fire nearly burnt out, are above the Muscovite 
colours. The reader can scarcely fail to see the appli- 
cation of these illustrations to Napoleon's history. 

Below the elephant, and in the centre of the same 
leaf, are grouped four coloured portraits; the one on 
the left hand looking outwards is General Upton, next 

1 Chunee, the largest elephant ever brought to England, first 
appeared in a pantomime at Covent Garden in 1810, was then shown 
at Exeter Change — now the Lowther Arcade — and on its becoming 
mad, was shot by a detachment of the Guards. 


356 THE LIFE OF 

to him are the late Marquis of Hertford and Lord Sefton, 
apparently in conversation; and the fourth (to me an 
inconnu) is on their right, and looking towards them. 
The general, who has a neck-cloth large enough for 
three, and a rounded shirt-collar on the same scale, is 
smelling a sprig of jessamine; a Cupid lolls on his 
shoulder, as much at ease as the reading Magdalen at 
Dresden, and is killing, not the general, but Time, with 
a book, probably Ovid's Art of Love. On the body 
of the gallant officer, who is thus indulging poor Cupid 
with a ride a pig-a-back, is pasted an unnatural and 
classical-looking landscape, representing a forest in the 
distance, with a rocky foreground; but the principal 
subject is a young lady, who having thrown aside her 
harp, is caressing the antlers of a wounded stag. Back 
to back with the general is the late Lord Sefton, the de- 
fect in whose figure Brummell concealed with a flower, 
probably with the intention of showing that he consi- 
dered his physical infirmities were entirely overbalanced 
by his amiable disposition. This he might well do, for 
he was one of his greatest benefactors. Between his 
lordship and the marquis is the head of a very lovely 
woman, ornamented, without the slightest necessity, by 
a plume of ostrich feathers. The two peers are so 
placed that it is difficult to say out of whose pocket 
the divinity is emerging; most likely that of the latter. 
Lord Sefton is in Hessians, and wears a very peculiar 
hat. My Lord of Hertford, whose whiskers look as 
if they were made of leopard's skin, is dressed in a 
great-coat, and carries a large cane between a pair of 


Earl of Sefton 


BE A U BR UMMELL. 357 

yellow tan gloves, his left hand being inserted, like 
Lord Sefton's right, in his pocket behind. His em- 
blems are also highly appropriate and numerous. 
First, and in the front, are two Cupids in an azure 
cloud, one bearing the hymeneal torch, and the other 
a dove, which is looking him amorously in the face. 
Cupids, in every variety of position that the coryphee 
of the grand opera could devise, float around his lord- 
ship. They may be literally said to swarm; and 
judging by their looks, each of them seems to be laden 
with the sweets of a different hive, more luscious than 
those of Narbonne or Hymettus. One, much larger 
and more saucy-looking than the rest, is standing on 
his lordship's shoulder, and rests, with folded arms, 
and the domesticated air of a favourite spaniel, upon 
his hat. To the right is a charming print, by Barto- 
lozzi or Cipriani, of a young girl attended by the ever- 
lasting Cupids; above her is a little archer shooting 
at doves in a palm-tree, and around are Satyrs carry- 
ing Bacchantes and Shepherdesses in their arms. 
Farther on is a gentleman who sports a pair of yellow 
knee-breeches, and is presenting a nest of doves to a 
lady in a scarlet-bodied dress. All these subjects 
appear to have been applique' with great judgment 
in honour of the most noble the late Marquis of 
Hertford. The t'nconnu, the last of the quartet, is 
the counterpart of a piping bullfinch, and by the em- 
blems that surround him may perhaps have been a 
celebrated " fanatico per la musica." These portraits 
are from Dighton's caricatures. « 


358 THE LIFE OF 

The Hyena in the second compartment is repre- 
sented as being tamed by the Arts, Sciences, and 
Religion, symbols of which, mingled with the Muses 
and the Graces, are seen on every side. In the 
centre of this leaf is a coloured print, taken from a 
scene in the " Fille mal gard£e." There are also 
various drawings representing historical, mythological, 
and rural subjects. Amongst the most striking are 
Telemachus relating his adventures to Calypso, 
Phaeton dn'ving his car, Time his chariot; a French 
dragoon at bivouac preparing a fowl for the camp- 
kettle; a religieuse at her devotions; a minuet at a 
French fair; a gentleman and a shepherdess, whose 
dog has seized the skirt of her dress, and with an 
anxious look is endeavouring to detach her from her 
admirer. 

The tiger on the third leaf is surrounded by 
Cupids, cows, goats, &c., all, with the exception of 
the first, harmless and peaceful animals. On each 
side of the royal brute is a coloured print, represent- 
ing the juvenile amusements of the Dauphin and the 
Duchesse d'Angouleme. In the one to the right they 
are playing at soldiers : she is marching in front of 
her brother and beating a drum, thus indicating the 
resolute spirit which she afterwards showed : her dog 
is scampering before her; and her companion, who is 
dressed in the national colours, is carrying a flag, on 
which are inscribed the words Union, Force. She 
has evidently tempted him away from his ninepins 
to follow her, and these toys are seen behind him 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 359 

scattered on the ground. In the other print they are 
playing at battledore and shuttlecock, looking very 
happy and very merry. The ferocious tiger was well 
chosen to illustrate the period and the subject to 
which this part of the screen is devoted; for in this 
beast of prey are plainly personified the cruelties of 
the Revolution, and, in the domestic animals, the 
helplessness of those who suffered by its horrible 
excesses. The children's ignorance of the nature of 
the proceedings of which their flag and their tri- 
coloured sashes were the emblems, and their utter un- 
consciousness of the anxiety and danger which at that 
very time surrounded them and all belonging to them, 
as expressed by their game of battledore and shuttle- 
cock, is truly characteristic of their years. Such 
happily is generally the case with children. In the 
midst of the dreadful hurricane in which the crew of 
the Bridgewater so nearly perished, and when not a 
ray of hope existed for the safety of a soul on board, 
where were the little children of one of the passengers, 
and what were they doing? Were they frightened 
at the unusual trembling of the ship, as she staggered 
under the concussions of each succeeding wave, or 
sobbing in their mother's arms? No; at that awful 
moment they were floating their little paper boats in 
the water that half filled the cabins. Below these 
prints are many other Cupids also, but by no means 
so comfortable as the one on Lord Hertford's shoulder. 
One poor boy is standing, in a cold wretched night, at 
the door of a house; his torch is thrown down in the 


360 THE LIFE OF 

snow, and his dripping pinions are scarcely covered by 
a scanty red mantle. He seems to be a good illustra- 
tion of the old song, " In the dead of the night," and 
is apparently singing the insinuating line, 

" I've lost my way, ma'am; do pray let me in." 

Near this mischief-maker is another smoking a pipe. 

Below the camel, in the fourth compartment, is a 
man in Cossack trousers : a monkey is sitting on his 
back, gently exciting his own epidermis : a pensive 
Cupid is clinging to the coat of the incognito. Near 
him is a gentleman with a lady in his arms; a Cupid 
is looking up at them, and pointing to a volume of 
sermons which he holds in his hand : a butterfly has 
alighted on the cavalier's coat, and not far off is a 
group of Cupids and satyrs rushing in among bathing 
nymphs. There is also a female barber. 

The bear in the fifth compartment is stimulating 
his appetite with a young crocodile : around him are 
children at play, shepherds, the Graces, Venus, and 
numerous insects and shells. Lower down are por- 
traits of Charles Fox, Nelson, Sheridan, the Regent 
Philip of Orleans, and John Kemble. Fox has a 
butterfly near him; Nelson, Greenwich Hospital; 
Sheridan, a Cupid carousing on some straw; and 
Kemble, a ladybird on his waistcoat. Round the arm 
of a man in Hessians is a green monkey holding a 
mask, and another monkey is between his legs. 
There are also likenesses of Lucien Buonaparte, the 
Princess Charlotte, and the Duke of Cambridge when 
a young man; and a little piece representing an old 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 361 

cure de village, trying, but in vain, to thread the needle 
of one of his pretty parishioners. 

Byron and Napoleon, placed opposite to each other, 
occupy the upper centre of the last and sixth leaf: 
the former is surrounded with flowers, but has a wasp 
on his throat. This to his friend was base ingratitude 
on the part of Brummell, for the noble lord spoke of, 
and would have pasted him, with more charitable feel- 
ing. Kean, as Richard, is the last print I shall notice. 
He is below the Emperor, and his neck is ornamented 
with two hymeneal torches laid together crosswise by 
a true-lover's-knot. 

It will be seen by this imperfect description that 
to understand fully the wit shown in the arrangement 
of all the groups, it is necessary that the observer 
should be familiar with the gossip of the day; and 
there is little doubt that any of Brummell's contem- 
poraries would, with the greatest ease, recapitulate 
the histories attached to each, and explain to his 
juniors, circumstances in the arrangement, that to them 
are merely unmeaning riddles. 

When Brummell left Calais, the screen, according 
to his valet's version of the affair, was placed in his 
hands as part payment of a debt. Subsequently, 
when Selegue's affairs became deranged, he was 
obliged to put it in pawn at an upholsterer's at 
Boulogne; and it was at this person's house that I 
saw it during my short stay in that town. A noble- 
man, one of Brummell's former friends, in passing 
through, was once anxious to buy it, but the gentle- 


362 THE LIFE OF 

man's gentleman valued his master's exertions too 
highly, and foolishly asked seven thousand francs for 
it, a bargain which his customer very naturally re- 
fused. Since that period, another Englishman offered 
two thousand; this, however, was declined; and when 
I saw it, the cabinet-maker was fitting it up very 
handsomely with a mahogany frame, and intended 
sending it to London, where he hoped to realise a 
large sum by the sale of it. This screen must have 
been a fertile subject of conversation for Brummell's 
privileged visitors, and to them only was it ever 
exhibited. To have heard him while employed in 
cutting out, cutting up, and pasting his dearest 
friends, and expatiating upon the group that was 
under his hands at the time, must have been a treat 
indeed. 

Having now introduced the reader to the Beau's 
buhl, Sevres, quadrupeds, and screen, I must not omit 
to mention a biped that completed his effeminate 
establishment. This was no less a personage than a 
stately green-and-yellow parrot, which was very much 
attached to him, and, in return, he treated the intelli- 
gent bird with great consideration. Brummell was 
never tired of singing his praises and calling the 
attention of his visitors to his beauty. " Is he not a 
fine bird? " he used to say. " What plumage ! what 
a beak and tail ! How solemn he looks ! Stand 
here, my good fellow, and examine him : don't you 
see a likeness to somebody? — a traveller, a poet, ay, 
and a patriot, too — a man who had the good luck to 


BEAU BRUMMELL. 363 

be sent to Newgate. Well now, how very obtuse; 
the likeness don't strike you, I see; " and then plac- 
ing his visitor in a different position, he would con- 
tinue thus : " Now, look at him in this point of view 
— now don't you see? how very odd ! why, don't 
you see how like he is to Hobhouse? " 

Hobhouse, however, at length got beyond the Board 
of Control, and was dismissed for malpractices into 
the court below, his beak being on more friendly terms 
with the curtains and the buhl furniture than was 
agreeable to his master, or rather to his master's 
locataire, for he was the property of Mr. Leleux. 
Whenever an opportunity offered, however, Hobhouse 
broke loose from his cage, and would fly up to the 
Beau's windows. For this contumacious conduct he 
at last got pinioned; but he was an obstinate fellow; 
and, as he could not take wing, he used to walk up- 
stairs, as well as his namesake or any other visitor, 
knock at his friend's door, and having obtained admit- 
tance, which he never failed to do, did not return 
to his cage without having received both wine and 
biscuit. This bird, I believe, came from Havre, 
appropriately termed, by Miss Costello, " the town of 
parrot."
